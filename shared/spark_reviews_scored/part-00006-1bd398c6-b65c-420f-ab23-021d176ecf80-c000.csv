Montebelo Viseu Congress Hotel & Spa,Catholic2011,20,Catholic2011wrote a review Mar 2025,"It is not admissible and unacceptable, that in a hotel eat rating of 5 *, see that in the hotel space, will access a van, that the same stop in front of the hotel post office, leave 5 pax and there is no trunk to collect the luggage of the customers.

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,HappyFamilyNZ,24,HappyFamilyNZwrote a review Sep 2012,"Wow, what a hotel and facilities and the location!! We stayed here for 3 nights and the weather was perfect, the  beach was perfect, the staff were perfect and it was simply relaxing!!We stayed in an apartment with 2 bedrooms and 2 en-suites. 3 levels. I st level kitchen and dining and lounge with guest toilet and shower (when you comeback from the beach), second level bedrooms, bathrooms and 3rd level private balcony with views of the ocean. Enjoy your breakfast here, or an evening drink with the family.The beach is a 2 minute walk from the hotel, to golden sands and blue waters. My kids and I had the most superb of times together....we shall cherish the experience.Secure and safe location. There is a convenient store close by the resort, where you will find everything for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is a 5 minutes drive. We bought our food here and made our breakfast to be enjoyed from our private balcony.There are several options for dinner in the city of Lagos, make a pick! Enjoy an evening of various music and stroll through the beautiful streets or just take in the sunset along the marina.Make sure you take a boat trip through the rock formations (opposite the Roman ruins).If you want relaxation and just a chill out.....this will be perfect for you and the family.!!!Highly Recommended, we will visit again for sure.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Voyage68380199513,0,Voyage68380199513wrote a review Jul 2024,Excellent resort! The amenities were great. We loved the pool area and bar. The food and drinks were good. Our apartment sweet had an amazing view of the ocean in the distance. Convenient location for the relaxation of a beach resort but proximity to city center and wonderful restaurants and bars. The layout of the property was confusing especially how to get to the adults pool through the spa facilities.,Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,5
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,29explorer,189,29explorerwrote a review Sep 2022,The biggest selling point of this property is the views and location.  The views were just jaw dropping.  we had a premium room.  The room was well appointed.The service at the front desk could have been better.  No one offered to take our luggage  to the room upon check in.  No one greeted upon arriving.One of the day room was not made till 3:00PM and once we called it was done right away but the used glasses were never cleaned.Service at breakfast was the best and the food was very good as well.Dinner buffet was some what disappointment s there was limited options.Overall 4 star as loved the views and location but service can be better.,Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,4

Hotel Madeira,traosb1,66,traosb1wrote a review Jun 2014,"From start to finish, this hotel made our trip to Madeira.  The service, cleanliness, location, staff...  All absolutely 10/10.  There's not enough I can possibly say to put across how happy we were with our stay, but if and when we arrive in Madeira again this is definitely where we're going to be staying.Arrival:  Check in quick and easy, friendly, spot onThe room:  We stayed in room 213 so over the little side street.  It was spotlessly clean, the air conditioning effective and all but silent, lovely walk in shower with good pressure, fresh towels every day, little balcony with shutters on the outside and sliding glass doors that could be closed and locked for the security conscious like us (although in Madeira crime levels are so low that when housekeeping opened the doors up every day and left them open we had no problems).  There's a little table and chairs on the balcony, a larger desk in the room and - with two wardrobes - ample storage space.  Unlike a lot of hotels, it wasn't a game of hunt the electrical socket, it was simply a case of choosing which socket was the most convenient - so with 2 cameras and 2 mobile phones before you start when sharing a twin room, this was excellent.Navigation:  Lets face it, some people (including my mother, whom I was travelling with) can get lost if you turn them around outside their back door.  Not only could she easily find the room on the first attempt, there was no trundling miles along various corridors and round in circles so she could find it every time.  Over and above this, she could also find the lounge, the breakfast room, the swimming pool, the bar, and even more importantly - because of the location - the hotel without any problems at all.  And speaking of the location:Location:  We like to do everything on foot when on holiday, and the location of this hotel was so central to everywhere that it made it easy.  Assuming you don't linger in the Municipal Gardens which make an inviting start to any day out being almost immediately opposite the front door at 45 degree angle, walking distances are (at quite a leisurely pace) 5mins to the marina, 10mins to Santa Catarina Park, 10mins to The Se (Cathedral), 10mins to the Santa Clara Convent which is almost next door to Quinta Dos Cruzes, 15mins to the Santa Maria De Colombo, 15mins to the Mercado Dos Lavradores (Farmers' Market) and the Cable Cars for Monte and the Madeira Story Centre are just behind the market.  You can stand on the roof terrace and plan out your route to pretty much anywhere you want to go.The rest:  Really accommodating staff - nothing was too much trouble, and they were more than happy to look after our luggage on check-out day when we had a late flight.  Breakfast was simple - bread, meat, cheese, fruit, croissants, scrambled or boiled eggs every day and one additional other hot option (e.g. sausage/bacon/pancakes) every other day.  Fruit juice and coffee available.  Basically your standard buffet continental breakfast with attentive (but not intrusive) staff keeping everything topped up.  From the roof terrace you can hear the live music clearly across the park from the Ritz Café, but likewise it is above the stage in the Municipal Park so if there's a concert on when you're there it's like having front row seats while lounging next to the pool.  A tip:  Joseph (the barman Tuesdays to Saturdays) mixes the best Poncha I tasted in Madeira!",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,jp3996,54,jp3996wrote a review Aug 2016,"The apartment we had was very spacious had washing machine and dishwasher. There are quite a few apartments packed in together so there was a bit of noise but it wasn't too bad. The place is organised as four quadrants and each with a pool plus and indoor pool. None of the pools are huge and so people seemd to stay at the one close to their apartment. You can't reserve the sun beds but it seemd to work well as everyone seemed able to get one when needed.The apartments in the main part of the hotel (apart hotel) seem to get cleaned most days but the tourist apartments only get cleaned once a week with a towel change mid week. Which worked for us not having to think about when maids were coming in and out, but we were a bit surprised by it.We were half board, breakfast was fine but nothing special, the evening meals wre nice and had a different theme each day. Beer, wine and soft drinks are included with the evening buffet, which was good. The hotel also has a half price cocktail of the day 6-7pm.There is a beach walking distance down a steep hill, but nowhere else really to go in easy distance, we drove to Lagos which has its marina and shops. But it's not a hotel to stay at if you like to go for short wanders from your hotel. A lot of the hotel is on quite a steep gradient and is very cobbled which might be a consideration if you have walking difficulties. There is plenty of parking with garages under the apartments.The in room wifi was really good.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Ze, Sisco and Sabina are very good persons and I am happy to know them. The most important is that they make this bussiness with a heart and everybody must feel it!

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,AnneVam,5,AnneVamwrote a review Nov 2021,"Great location, desk service and full marks for boutique style, however the hotel did not live up to our expectations. Our deluxe garden room was expensive for a small metal balcony overlooking the garden - no direct garden access as the booking picture had. It was web summit week and the two nights we wanted to use the bar, we couldn’t because of functions and were given no notice of this. Breakfast was good, but one morning we waited over 20 mins for a poached egg even though it was quiet. All small things but I think we expected excellence all round for such an awarded and expensive hotel.",Nov,2021,Nov 2021,2021-11-01,2021,3
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Gwenowilliams,2,Gwenowilliamswrote a review Aug 2017,"I have just returned from my holiday in this hotel having spent a LOT of money (it took me a year to save up). I was expecting 5 star quality. The staff is all areas (restaurant, spa and reception) wet very nice and ALWAYS helpful. All in all it was a nice stay if it ws a 3 star hotel. My main pints are these:1. I got a a one bedroom apartment - I was with my two daughters (aged 18 and 16) and the sofa bed had a bed underneath (which took a bit to remove)- be warned this was a very thin mattress!! We moved it to the bedroom because it was a pain to take out every night !! but on the last 2 nights they had had enough taking it in turns to sleep on that and so the three of us ended up sleeping on two single beds!! not Ideal as you can imagine!! The sofa bed was hopeless to sit on as well2. Cleaning !!! My room wasn't cleaned at all on Saturday, Sunday or Tuesday ( I was told that no cleaning was done on Sundays!!! never heard of this happening in a 5 star hotel before!!!) I complained and the manager asked how he can make up for it. I asked if we could stay in the room longed than th 12 check out time on our last day (that was no problem) I also asked for them to pay for the  manicure and pedicure I had received the day earlier (worth 50 euros) again that was fine, however, by next morning the receptionist had no knowledge of this and phoned the manager who told him that I was to get only 25% off!!!! not happy at all being told LIES!!!!!3. DO NOT SLEEP IN ROOM 115 if you want to sleep before 11 pm and as the room is above the bar and the entertainment. This was VERY loud. I was told by the receptionist that all the hotel guests were in the same position!!! I don't think rooms ion the third floor could hear what I heard. I was given a bottle of wine to make up for it!! I don't drink wine. I wanted my sleep especially on the first night having travelled all day!!4. Food was ok on the whole - make sure you go down first thing to breakfast and dinner to have the food at its best as after that it gets cold quickly. the salad is very nice - desserts are a bit random - ok if you like lots of different flavours jelly!!5. The jacuzzi hadn't worked for 5 days - I was told they were expecting someone to repair it. This was a great disappointment to us, however, having looked at the jacuzzi it was very very small for a 5 star hotel.6. The shower is over the bath and not a lot of water comes out so not brilliant7. You had to pay extra for the SAFE which is not rightThe kitchen is great with all facilities you want. two TVs which have BBC1. BBC2 ITV and Channel 4. WIFI was ok. Free Shuttle bus to Old Town is great. If you go to the indoor swimming pool you can great free towels to use rather than paying for them at the outdoor pool.Will not be recommending this hotel to friends as a 5 star hotel as such. A 3 maybe 4 yes",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,2

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",RichardVUK,319,RichardVUKwrote a review Feb 2024,"Reid's is one of the world's great and hotels. It is nestled above the centre of Funchal with fabulous views from all the bedrooms and the terrace off the bar. The welcome is exactly that, warm and friendly and the fabric of the building when you come in is steeped in history and colonial charm. The rooms are lovely and the public spaces are many and extensive. The original wooden floors in the bar and the William Restaurant are worthy of note. Considering the level of luxury and charm the prices are not at all bad though drinks and food will bump up costs on a B&B tariff. You should take B&B as the breakfast is world class but it is very well worth eating out as there are a number of really good restaurants in the vicinity and in Funchal Old Tow.

A great hotel with excellent staff, check in was a pleasure and the bar and restaurant staff were attentive and friendly. A little out of town, but not a big issue, as the metro is excellent and taxi's cheap. Don't be tempted to pre-book a transfer from the airport as the taxi was only 8 euros and only ten minutes away.

Dom Carlos Liberty,GerardN,176,GerardNwrote a review Jun 2008,"Based on a recommendation by friends, we booked into the Dom Carlos Liberty - the hotel has two properties in Lisbon.  The rooms are nice and clean, albeit on the smaller side.  The rate included breakfast (fine, basic) and free internet access (wired only).  The staff were very friendly, gave good recommendations and spoke very good English.  The hotel is centrally located with easy access to public transport (metro, bus).  My only caveat which prevents me from recommending the hotel is that the air conditioning for the entire property failed at 5 pm on the second day of our stay and could not be fixed until the following day.  The window in our room was fixed and could not be opened.  Fortunately, the room \"only\" got to 26 degrees at night - it could have been far worse if this happened during summer.",Jun,2008,Jun 2008,2008-06-01,2008,3
PortoBay Liberdade,liv75,1,liv75wrote a review Jun 2016,"I stayed at Porto Bay with my sister for a week and we loved it!  We had a room overlooking the street which was a bit noisy starting at 8 am since there was building construction on the other side of the road - since we were up early for sight seeing, it wasn't much of an issue.  The staff, particularly Mariana (?) the lady at the reception,  were very friendly and helpful and gave us excellent advice for retsaurants, in particular, we loved the tapas restaurant a few blocks away.  Rooms are small but cosy with super comfy beds and had coffee machines which was nice in the morning.  We both also tried the spa which was heavenly.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,mike_gss,20,mike_gsswrote a review Aug 2017,"This a typical Marriott hotel - high standards, clean, spacious and comfortable with all the usual hotel amenities. Although a few tourists were seen (we were a family of 4 on holiday), the hotel caters primarily to the business community. The location is a few miles \"out of town\" (closer to the airport than to the old town) and there are few places to get to on foot from the hotel with the exception of the zoo. However, taxis (including Uber) are plentiful and relatively cheap considering the general costs incurred in Lisbon. Internal costs (hotel bar, restaurants, shops etc.) are high (cheapest pint of beer is 9 Euros, cocktails typically 10-15 Euros, burger and fries 12 Euros at the bar, higher in the restaurant. A small carton of milk from the shop was 2 Euros). A small supermarket is approximately 10-12 minutes walk from the hotel entrance.The staff are extremely good; pleasant, friendly and efficient.Rooms are spacious (although one of our rooms was upgraded to \"Executive\" class), air-conditioned, well furnished and the beds were particularly comfortable. The housekeeping service was very good. Rooms have a safe and a fridge but use of the latter incurs an additional fee. In-room internet is not free and costs around 5-6 Euros per day. Internet in public areas of the hotel is, however, free.Outside there's a pool (large but unheated) in a grassy park with a pool bar and also access to the main restaurant, but there's not much for younger children to do there apart from a few garden swings etc. This seems consistent with the business-focussed aspect of the hotel. We did not eat in the restaurant but had a couple of evening meals (very good) in the hotel bar.Lisbon's old town is a wonderful place. Restaurants are plentiful - the ones in the main part of old town tend to be pricey, however a short walk up the side hill streets will be rewarded by lower prices for the same food. We found plenty to see and do during a week's stay, including day trips out (by Uber - around 25-28 Euros each way) to the beautiful Palace and castle at Sintra and to the seaside town of Cascais. The cab can take you straight to the palace entrance at Sintra avoiding a log slog walking up the mountain or additional coach transfers from the railway or bus stations). Unless you're feeling fit, cabs can also take you right up the hills surrounding old town Lisbon to the entrances of the castles and museums there. These attractions are very beautiful and interesting and you'll also be rewarded with spectacular views of the city.In June/July the Lisbon population was swelled with many global tourists although fortunately Lisbon has yet to become a favoured destination for \"stag\", \"hen\" and \"drinking-group\" parties from our sceptred isle, so there is a palpable air of old-style civilisation about the place!On the whole we were pleased with our stay although we'd probably choose a more central location next time. The hotel internal prices could have been more \"realistic\" however.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4

Upon checking in, we were immediately shown to our room, given all of the information about the apartment, the city, and all the amenities offered, and provided a cell phone which gave us access to maps, attractions, and even 30 minutes of free international calling per day!  The phone really came in handy, as we checked in with our family after several weeks away. We were also able to look up restaurants, make sure we were navigating properly, and even call ahead for reservations to restaurants.  Instead of the traditional keys or key cards given to guess, everything was done by keypads. This was pleasant as well, as all we had to do was remember the front door code and our apartment code, and did not have to remember to bring our keys or keycards everywhere we went.  The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and clean.  All in all, a wonderful experience, great location, and very worthwhile for the money.

The area was extremely quiet and was an idyllic place to relax. There is Praia Dona Ana beach about a 5 min walk from the hotel with a great beach bar and restaurant as well as bathroom facilities. The views were incredible from the beach. Camilo beach and Ponte de Piedade we’re also really short walks. Each night we walked to downtown Lagos, which only took about 10-15 min. We had an early train back to Lisbon and the hotel manager was able to set up an early taxi for us the day before.

On arrival, our room wasn't ready (we weren't expecting it to be ready) so we were invited to enjoy complimentary coffee on the terrace. We had a nice hour in the sun & were delighted to be told that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Room with its own patio! Much appreciated & unexpected touch. The receptionist Joanna was informative & friendly, as are all the staff in this Grande Dame of hotels, in a old fashioned, comforting way.The room was large, comfortable, elegantly decorated with a marble bathroom & a private patio overlooking the gardens. Housekeeping was super, as is to be expected, and the room was immaculate at all times. Free soft drinks in the mini bar & fresh water by the bed each night is another nice touch.The swimming pools are well kept, but the main one is salt water & one floats rather than swims!Afternoon tea is a must, but be warned, there is a dress code of no shorts for men, not even smart Bermudas. A bit of a double standard when women are allowed the shortest of skirts & to sunbathe topless by the pools!This is not a family friendly hotel, although there were a few children, and most of the clientele are older, but that doesn't detract from it's wonderful old world elegance & charm.I've always wanted to stay there & we weren't disappointed.

Royal Savoy Hotel,rodeton,23,rodetonwrote a review Aug 2019,"Visited last week in July.  Wonderful suite room 1501 which had an unbelievably largebalcony and even a kitchen area.  Staff are wonderful! Always on their toes and so polite; from cleaning staff up, the welcome is so warm and friendly.  Stayed bed and breakfast.  Best omelettes I’ve ever had!  Breakfast in general was just fabulous and very wide ranging to suit all tastes, I had the most delicious  Madeira cake every morning.  All the staff were just wonderful but the team at the  pool side restaurant and downstairs bar were particularly memorable; so caring  and also very entertaining, particularly the two Joses at the pool side restaurant !  Visited here as a kid at the original Savoy in the 70s and it was a thrill to return to the present day version of the hotel.  Loved the location being on the sea front as I snorkelled everyday and only wish I had got round to booking the hotel’s dive instructor.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,5
Torel Palace Porto,Vivian L,3,Vivian Lwrote a review Jun 2025,"We had a wonderful stay at the boutique Torel Palace Porto. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind. This historic site, a former palace converted to a boutique hotel, was the perfect choice for my husband, who loves literature. Every room is named after a Portuguese author, and we were thrilled with the \"Royal Suite\", which was spacious and ornate. With plenty of room to unpack and move around, it was ideal for our family of three. Our windows offered a view of a charming narrow street lined with colorful tiled buildings. The literary theme continued on the first floor with hanging books and a library. We also enjoyed the port tasting, a small-group experience that was both instructive and delicious. Dinner at 1 Michelin-starred Blind was fantastic and fun! We highly recommend this hotel for its well-rounded excellence in service, decor, staff, food, and location.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,5

No closet (some storage available on the wall). The toilet/shower room is really small too, a single person can fit inside at any time.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Helpfulhints,12,Helpfulhintswrote a review Jan 2023,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Vilamoura for two nights during our summer break after an initial week in Lagos. The price of our stay was indicative of the hotel’s location, in quite an affluent area of the Algarve and also alluded to it’s  5 star rating.Reception were warm and accommodation at all times, storing our luggage on arrival and arranging an airport transfer for our departure. The breakfast buffet was well stocked and the outdoor seating was a lovely option for dining. The dinner buffet was okay but i wouldn’t rush back to it. The room itself was clean and spacious. The balcony again was a nice addition both practically for drying clothes and for relaxation at various points in the day.However, I have experienced all of the above at 4 star establishments for a more reasonable price.I did not feel we received value for money during our stay as we incurred several additional albeit optional expenses.The prices for both food and drinks in the Seafront restaurant and bar are laughable. €9 for a beer saw me purchasing alcohol from the local supermarket thereafter. My boyfriend’s lunch portion was so small that I shared my wrap and chips with him.Use of the indoor spa/pool area cost an extra €12, an expense that I would encourage others to skip as the pools were cold and the tiles cracked.While guests must also give a deposit for use of the indoor pool table. A portion of this is refunded on return for the equipment.I would expect that things like pool tables and use of some indoor facilities be complimentary in most 5 star establishments. It should also go without saying that if I have spent a considerable amount of money to stay there, I don’t expect to pay inflated prices for mediocre food or drink on site.I wouldn’t want other couples or groups to spend hard earned money on what they feelwill be a “luxurious stay”, only to leave somewhat disappointed.",Jan,2023,Jan 2023,2023-01-01,2023,4
Villas D. Dinis Charming Residence Adults Only,naturewoman,47,naturewomanwrote a review Apr 2011,"We arrived for a week-end stay with our two 19 year- old girls who were studying in Seville. I had chosen this place because of what I read on this web-site and it was even better than described! The owner and front desk staff are wonderful and will do everything to make your stay the best that it can be. The location is ideal (you can walk to at least 2 or 3 beaches), walk into town, and there is a little mini-mart located near-by to purchase wine, groceries, etc. We stayed in Unit 19 which had a roof-top terrace with a sea view!  When we arrived the owner also offered us other rooms and let us make the decision which room we wanted.  He also made dining recommendations along with possibilites for day trips. As I did not travel with my lap-top it was great to see there was a computer for me to use free of charge! We had a great time and are hoping to return!",Apr,2011,Apr 2011,2011-04-01,2011,5

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Amanda p,6,Amanda pwrote a review Nov 2022,We recently stayed and were delighted with our weeks stay. We had a lovely warm welcome at check in. A bit of a mission finding our room but when we did we were not disappointed.  We were more at the end and around tha back and it was so peaceful and quiet at night. We also had a view of the sea which was an added bonus. Can not fault our room at all. The bed was so comfortable so slept well. All staff were amazing from cleaners gardeners and bar staff. We were there for the start of the world cup and the big outdoor tv went wrong. Maintenance were there straight away and all fixed. He was our hero that night as we did not want to miss the game. One of our best holidays so we thank the hotels staff for that. You were all so lovely.,Nov,2022,Nov 2022,2022-11-01,2022,5

The view is fabulous!I would say it's not a 5 star hotel, based on our experience the little touches are lacking. They had a note we were on our honeymoon but didn't add the extra touches such as bottle of bubbly in the room. The staff at reception even mentioned they had a note of honeymoon. I think the lack of attention to detail let them down.I realise there's no obligation to do something but it's those small touches that make it a 5 star experience.

Hotel Albergaria Dias,vy2,83,vy2wrote a review Oct 2012,"We have just returned from our first holiday in Madeira and spent two weeks at the Hotel Albergaria Dias. What a treat!  From the warm welcome, to the room and balcony, the breakfast, the lovely, well trained, staff everything was excellent.  Mr Dias, his family and his staff are what makes this hotel stand out from the rest. Everyone is friendly, effortlessly efficient, and happy to advise or just pass the time of day.  The hotel and grounds are spotless and a real haven away from the bustle of Funchal.  If you are looking for a large hotel with stacks of 'facilities' don't go to this hotel!  If you want a small, elegant, exceptionally clean hotel offering friendly staff, excellent food, lovely pool and gardens this is the place for you.  There is even a small gym and library. The bar and terrace is a pleasant place to relax and, in my opinion, makes the best Poncha in Funchal (and I carried out a comprehensive survey!!). Being in the Old Town is a huge advantage for this hotel as it is a short walk to the local restaurants, the cable car, the bus station, the waterfront and the town itself with it's shops and famous market.  All in all, a lovely holiday was had in superb surroundings on a beautiful island.  We shall definately be returning!",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,5

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,mhomelvig,6,mhomelvigwrote a review Oct 2017,"After reading the reviews, we were excited about our stay at Altis Belem. Due to flight difficulties, we were a day late for our arrival.We called Starwood Hotels who sent an email letting Altis Belem know. Starwood seemed to think Altis Belem would give us back our points for the missed day. In addition, Starwood sent Altis a request for pickup at the airport and said Altis Belem would respond with an email or call. We received nothing.Upon our arrival, we were greeted with a young woman who was anything but friendly (the reviews were that the staff was very friendly). We explained we were a day late and she kept looking for our reservation.  After a while of looking and not talking, she went into the back room and found our reservation paperwork with 'no show' written across the paper.There was no mention of getting our points back, sympathy for getting delayed, etc. What we were told was that we needed to wait for 5-10 minutes to make sure our room was ready.If you are from the States... this may not be your idea of a Category 5 hotel for the following reasons:You can't close the bathroom doorThere are no washcloths (asked for one and told it would be delivered. Not.There is no iron or ironing boardThere is no coffeemakerThe only place to find a plug to charge a cell phone is on the floor by the TVWe are Starwood members and asked for a 1:00 checkout.
