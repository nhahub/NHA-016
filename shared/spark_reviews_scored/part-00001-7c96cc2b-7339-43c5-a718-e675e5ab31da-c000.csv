Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Olivia C,22,Olivia Cwrote a review Aug 2012,"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon- staff delivered champagne to the room on the first night, which was a lovely surprise! I LOVED the pool areas(indoor & outdoor), quiet, relaxing, no problems getting a sun lounger. Our room was lovely, clean & comfortable , TV with loads of channels if you want to take a break from sunbathing (including RTE 2, Irish readers!), and cooking facilities-handy for us as we didn't eat breakfast in the dining room. They don't replenish shampoo, shower gel etc in the room ( I asked) so bring your own or buy some in the supermarket (3 minute drive from hotel)...don't end up washing your hair with a bar of soap (like me.)Nice bar area with very friendly bar staff. Town is a five minute taxi drive away, the beach is a two minute walk away. We stayed for a week, wish it could have been two!!!",Aug,2012,Aug 2012,2012-08-01,2012,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Peter R,109,Peter Rwrote a review Nov 2022,"We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The location is magnificent, with spectacular ocean and coastal views. The beautiful nearby town of Carvoeiro offers a variety of great restaurants in a picture-perfect setting. We booked one of Tivoli’s lowest-priced rooms during the shoulder season in early November - very affordable! The room was fine but it didn’t have a desk or table where I could work. The hotel generously moved me to a larger room with a desk at no charge. We have stayed at Tivoli hotels elsewhere and the experience is consistently excellent. I highly recommend the Tivoli Carvoeiro.",Nov,2022,Nov 2022,2022-11-01,2022,5
Vila Gale Porto Ribeira,Wander387287,17,Wander387287wrote a review Apr 2019,"We enjoyed a very comfortable stay in this charming, quiet hotel.  Rooms were all decorated to a high standard and the staff were extremely helpful and polite.  The buffet breakfast was delicious.  It takes 15 minutes to walk along the riverbank to the main old town.  It is advisable to make a table reservation for evening dining in the city but there are a couple of restaurants next door to the hotel, for very reasonably priced and good quality food, as well as a Gin bar.  We took advantage of the Hop on/off Bus tour, which included a riverboat cruise and two wine tasting visits (which the hotel happily organised for us).  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our break and would be happy to recommend this hotel.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,55angel,2,55angelwrote a review Dec 2021,"Everything was amazing. Loved the location, the rooms had balconies looking out on the cliffs and the interconnecting door was great! The staff were friendly and professional. The only disappointment was booking half board on the information I was given that dinner was a buffet. In fact it was a set menu of extremely limited choice. When I asked to have credit and choose from the al a carte menu they would only refund 25E!!! I am still shocked about this and it totally ruined the lasting impression of what was otherwise a fabulous experience.",Dec,2021,Dec 2021,2021-12-01,2021,2

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,Nicole T,6,Nicole Twrote a review May 2016,"This hotel is very easy on the eye - designed to incorporate the old buildings with the new, it makes the most of its fantastic cliff-top location. In addition, the well-tended garden features beautiful palm trees and exotic flowers, and the pool is a visual delight. There are several lovely places to sit and contemplate the horizon while enjoying a drink. It is a hotel more appropriate for quiet nature-lovers than noisy families or party animals, so if you are loud this is not the place for you. The room interiors are minimalistic so as to draw your attention to the incredible views outside. Staff are helpful and the free mini-bus shuttle service is excellent. It is well worth taking up the offer of a lift to one of the levada walks with a pick-up at the other end.Perhaps the only downside is the dinner menu which does not change throughout the week (whereas the breakfast is excellent) and the substandard sandwiches included in the picnic for walkers.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,mazee831,9,mazee831wrote a review Sep 2019,"We arrived before hotel check in time and were greeted and treated well by reception staff. We were told that despite early arrival our room was available soon after. If only they had taken the additional time between guests departure and official check in time of new guests then maybe the criticism of cleanliness, pictures attached could have been avoided.This hotel however is in a fantastic location, central to both old, new towns and beach. HOTEL staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful, special praise to Sergio (bar) and Cristiano (reception) whom both offered a welcoming attitude and good tips throughout our stay.5* we very much doubt it would achieve this in the UK, hotel chain offer far cleaner, ambient places than here unfortunately.Our view is this is predominantly due to a tour company called FRAM(ISSIMA). This company, being audited and therefore hopefully taken over make non French guests feel unwelcome, excluded from activities and pretty much not important. Witnessed and commented on by many non French guests we spoke to whom felt the same as us. Of those FRAM staff reps there during our stay, 3 at least attempted to be polite but excluded us, whereas one girl in particular was downright rude and aggressive in her demeanour towards us. It was clear that if you were not a French guest as this company are then you were nothing......and this was expressed quite clearly, sometimes with distaste once the reps eyes had seen the colour of your hotel band (grey means French and royalty in Frams eyes, framissima being on the band whereas other guests had mutho name and emblam).Do not take this review as negative. Other than cleanliness and poor food quality (at best luke warm, despite eating within 5 mins of opening, this hotel was lovely) and if FRAM were removed would be re-visited by us in the future.Manager of hotel.

PortoBay Liberdade,Alison R,17,Alison Rwrote a review Nov 2016,"We were at the front of the hotel - but were not disturbed by the building work; in fact we did not realise work was going on until we opened the balcony door.  We did not drink the coffee pods, because we were really surprised to have to pay for replacements and it was easy to go out for drinks.  Have not given this attractive 5 star hotel 5 stars because the glass bathroom door was so heavy and difficult to use - and we got stuck in the lift.  You use your room card to get the lift to go up - but someone in the hotel had not programmed our cards for the number of days we were staying (4).  Once the lift door shut on me, I was in total darkness, and I had to find the torch on my phone to find the emergency button - which was not lit, nor would the door open.  At that point my husband came into the lift, but his card didn't work either.  Pressing the emergency button brought almost instant help, but no real apology.Food in the aviator bar was good and quite reasonably priced; we spent most of our time exploring this wonderful city so did not avail ourselves of anything else the hotel could offer.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,4

Don't get me wrong, I love my country, but its rare to find an establishment of such great taste and wonderful service. The whole experience is rather reminiscent of a riad in Marrakech.The five rooms are each decorated differently and each one is wonderful. Makes you want to stay five nights, one in each room! Special highlight: the waterfall showers in two of the rooms.Gilberto was attentive and sweet and a source of good recommendations. Thank you!",Apr,2013,Apr 2013,2013-04-01,2013,5

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Laz1972,8,Laz1972wrote a review Sep 2003,"I traveled to Lisbon in late Aug 2003. The hotel, although nice, with a friendly staff, is not ideally situated for a tourist. This hotel is made more for the business traveler, since it is in the financial district. Lucky for tourists in Lisbon, taxis and public transportation is cheap, and you are within 15 minutes of where you need to be. We recommend trying the AM buffett for a good start to the day. When booking, go thru a travel agent in Europe for a voucher. We paid on $50.00 Euro per night.",Sep,2003,Sep 2003,2003-09-01,2003,3

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Bequia186233,29,Bequia186233wrote a review Sep 2017,"We recently spent a week in this lovely city, I had read it's the second safest city in Europe.We stayed at Lisbon Marriott hotel, which was fab.  The hotel gives you everything you could possibly want, we had an Executive room on the 8th floor, which overlooks the gardens and outdoor pool area. This room had a very smart bathroom and a 6' bed which was to die for in terms of comfort, no aching backs in the morning.  The hotel is well managed, efficient and very clean. The hotel is quite close to a busy motorway, but the noise factor in your room, once the balcony door is shut is fairly minimal, so not a problem at night.The Metro station Jardin de Zoological, opposite the entrance to Lisbon Zoo,is a 15 minute walk from the hotel and the underground system is both easy to use, clean and safe, we didn't use it at night, so couldn't comment on that. However you have to buy the metro tickets at the station, from an automated machine with no English translation, so a Portuguese dictionary would be useful. It's about €3 per person return, into the centre of Lisbon.  If you prefer to get a taxi, these are always available at the hotel. A bus service operates very close to the hotel, but we didn't use it.Lisbon as a destination has everything, explore the old town area near the seafront, this is in stark contrast to the modern   city centre. Great shopping opportunities, restaurants and bars.  It is a very walkable city, there are sightseeing bus tours for the foot weary and tram tours. The old town is full of restaurants, every street has at least six to ten places to eat situated in the middle of each street.If you have exhausted what Lisbon has to offer go to Cascais or Sintra, we travelled to both these destinations by local trains. The train to Cascais hugs the coastline and goes through Estoril before reaching its final destination of Cascais.  Sintra is inland, and quite elevated, I thought it was too busy and touristy, there were too many huge tour buses trying to use the small roads,running through the town, which spoiled the experience for me. In contrast Cascais is a delight, it's definitely the jewel in the crown of this area, so pretty, with two beautiful beaches, and a good assortment of hotels, restaurants and bars etc.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

Torel Palace Porto,Julianne,2,Juliannewrote a review Oct 2021,"I am so happy with my choice of the Torel Palace Hotel for my visit to Porto. The hotel was absolutely beautiful! So opulent and probably one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. I didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening, but the breakfast was wonderful. Location was great as well - easy walking distance to everything. I'm pretty easygoing so didn't need much from the staff, but when we did interact they were so kind. Finally, they surprised me on the morning of my birthday with a cake and a glass of champagne at breakfast. I didn't tell them it was my birthday so they must have noticed from my passport, and I was so, so touched (especially as I was solo traveling for the first time!). Incredible hotel - will never stay anywhere else when I return to Porto. Obrigada!",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,5

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",10sman2017,54,10sman2017wrote a review Jul 2018,"Last time we visited Madeira in 2016, we walked into Reid's Palace to take a look at the interior after having read about it in an Island guide book. The views from the terrace are so iconic and beautiful, that they transport you back to a bygone era of decadence and elegance.  This year, we decided that, although we couldn't afford to stay in the hotel, we would at least visit for coffee, or a cocktail.The bar staff are immaculate and extremely courteous. As it was still before midday, we opted for non-alcoholic cocktails and juices, which were presented to us in tall, garnished glasses, along with a silver platter of delicious salted nuts and snacks. Yes, the drinks are not cheap, but they are worth the price, just to feel that you are experiencing a bit of luxury in a beautiful setting.We had thought about booking  afternoon tea, and might do on another occasion, as I think it would be lovely, given the surroundings and politeness of the staff. Even if you don't come and stay in the hotel, do come and buy a drink, just so you can sit on the terrace and take a look at the interior of the lounge. It's worth a visit.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,4

Dream Chiado,becky28645,37,becky28645wrote a review Jun 2018,"This Apartment is quite difficult to find when you first arrive on it's Street in Lisbon. A small suggestion to the management would be to put up a bigger Name Board.The location is Prime. It lies right in the centre of all the best restaurants, branded stores, souvenir shops and departmental stores.An absolute value for the money you pay.On our arrival we took the elevator up to the reception which is actually behind another apartment behind a closed door. On knocking, a very cheerful lady stepped out and took us to our room. The check-in procedure was done in our room itself. She then went on to explain to us about all the amenities in our room. She offered us a very friendly warm welcome.The room was like a studio apartment. It had a small kitchen with a little dining table fit for the both of us. The kitchen also had utensils, a microwave, a cooking range, a water heater and coffee.The room had a balcony which offered a very nice view of the street below.It was a very nice pleasant brightly coloured room.The bathroom was very clean and neat as well.The best part of our stay was that in our room, they placed a complimentary bottle of Red Wine as a welcome gift to us.The only downside is there is no breakfast option but then again it's an apartment and because of its prime location there are plenty of Patisseries all around.I would highly recommend this place to a tourist for their stay in Lisbon.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,4

I had a one bedroom apartment with sea views, comfortable, clean and accessible. Sadly for the hotel it was only about 20% full of capacity which is great for the residents at the time. I guess the only reason for this is it is somewhat a family hotel and I might have a different view with hordes of children to contend with. I would certainly think about a couple of weeks here again next May",May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,4

The hotel is great, very clean, great staff. Our room was on the 1 st floor and had a full working kitchen much to my surprise. The afternoon live entertainment around the pool was a surprise to. It was busy but could usually get a sunlounger at any time of day. We will definitely be returning",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Fernando,1,Fernandowrote a review Dec 2023,"The rooms are very good, but the cleaning is not adapted to Spanish time (they clean during siesta time 4:00 p.m. Spanish time)All lunches and dinners outside the hotel about 400 meters in another hotel that if you catch a bad schedule you are left waiting.We went all-inclusive and the coffee machine was out of service for the 4 days we went (espresso is not included in all-inclusive).The beer in the only bar on the premises that you can drink from 12:00 to 16:00 did not have beer (it arrived at 16:00 and closed at 17:00)) you go to the other bar (only two have it in all inclusive) and it doesn't have beer either and they tell reception that the keg is in the other bar and they have to bring it back...All inclusive drink.bad white ark.Regular coverage, it is not a hotel for children or people with reduced mobility.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,TTravel71,180,TTravel71wrote a review May 2005,"Hotel was really super, rooms large, spacious and very clean.  Showers where excellent, really powerful.  Breakfast choice was better than most hotels we've stayed in.  Worth paying the extra couple of euros for a pool view room as all others look at uninspiring sights such as a petrol station or car park!!!  Beach isn't within walking distance (no matter how into walking you are!!!) but a shuttle bus will take you to a sister hotel & then a short boat trip for 1 euro per person.  Lots of fish restaurants in the area, one restaurant in particular worth noting is the 'Bistrot oPortoâ€™, on Rua Ze Pires Padinha, 2 mins from the hotel, really excellent food, especially the octopus tempura - heaven!!!!  Friendly service & the owner is a real character - we went back and enjoyed it even more the second time.  All in all a very relaxing way to spend a week - definitely not for those of you who enjoy nightlife or English food - but then to be fair we wouldnâ€™t want you to go if you did!!!",May,2005,May 2005,2005-05-01,2005,5

Quinta das Achadas,Sue&Baz,14,Sue&Bazwrote a review Sep 2009,"What can I say? A perfect spot with perfect hosts (and pets).Everything about the Quinta makes you feel at home. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated, the bathroom was bright and cheerful, the gardens were colourful and well maintained, the pool area was lovely and the 'honesty bar' was my favourite spot.We had one evening meal with Jill and Julio and it was a delight. They are such easy going hosts and with good food and wine the evening flew by.Nothing about the Quinta makes you feel rushed - everything is geared around you, the guests, having a relaxing time.If you want a holiday that truly will relieve your stress then this is the place to go.Two points of caution though:-1) If you throw a stone for Jake the dog, it will become your job for as long as you are there - he's a lovely dog though and he will keep you company during those peaceful hours, relaxing on your terrace.2) Don't talk football (soccer) with Julio - he has some strange views on who is good and who isn't.In conclusion I suggest you get on their website and book now, because places like this are hard to find.",Sep,2009,Sep 2009,2009-09-01,2009,4

Bus stop at bottom of drive for bus 39 to Funchal regularly if like us, you don't want to rush for the courtesy mini bus.  Lovely breakfast served from 7.30-10.30. Good size pool on rooftop amidst beautiful gardens. Amazing views of the  sea and Funchal. Now the downside.....no drink making facilities in the room!",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4

Luna Hotel Da Oura,fiona453,6,fiona453wrote a review Oct 2018,On arrival of hotel all was good was the Sunday afternoon first impression was yeh hotel nice staff was nice and friendly thing going well even when microwave wasnâ€™t working the put a brand new one in !! But on the Wednesday early evening I received the worst news possible my brother was seriously ill so I made my way to reception and spoke to the gentleman on desk explaining my situation but he just said to go to computer and look at flights !! which I did but was so upset that I couldnâ€™t focus on doing this properly but thankfully my daughter at home managed to sort flight home the next day and she would email everything through!! By which time got the devastating news that he had died gutted as we were we still had to sort paperwork out so back to the gentleman at desk with blue glasses on and he declined to help once again saying we canâ€™t use hotel computer to print  of paper work by this time tempers are fraying with us so my partner raised his voice!! the gentleman went to the office  asked manager if we could use computer and manager said yes so once again I tried to work computer but was to distressed to do it properly but thankfully a ladie from an office came to our aid and managed to help up get the paper work printed so we could be on our way home next day !! so the upshot is donâ€™t ask the gentleman with blue glasses on the desk to help you in your hour of need as he was totally unhelpful and border line rude and should not be left in charge of desk !!!!,Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,1

The sun shone throughout and the homely and welcoming atmosphere of the Quinta ensured that we had a relaxing and memorable week. We walked some local walks, visited some beautiful beaches and spent some idyllic hours around the warm pool. Jill was able to answer our many questions about the local area and recommended outings and restaurants that we would never have found on our own. The barbecue nights were great fun when we had the chance to chat with our fellow guests and enjoy some of Jill's great cooking.Thank you Jill, Julio and Isabella for making us so comfortable",Jun,2010,Jun 2010,2010-06-01,2010,5

Transportation from airport to hotel is via red metro line, hotel is the last stop of this line. The metro station is in front of the hotel. Room and bathroom were big enough and very clean. There was a fridge in the room. Breakfast was good but there should be egg, olives and tomatoes. There should be drinking water in rooms. The service of the hotel was good, staff was kind and friendly. They know english well. There was a shopping mall which is so close to the hotel. The onyl negative thing was bathroom's shower water was weak.",Sep,2013,Sep 2013,2013-09-01,2013,4

Very convenient if you need to get to the airport in the morning, perhaps less so if you want to be within walking distance of the historic city centre. Both exterior, lobby and the rooms have very modern feel to them. Impressive view from our room on the 20th floor. Staff is efficient, friendly and helpful.

HF Fenix Lisboa,emfi,112,emfiwrote a review Nov 2020,"I booked a room in HF Garden and only while heading to my room did I found out that I was in HF Lisboa... Booking.com and HF hotels website do not warn customers that only HF Lisboa is open for business due to Covid. After the first shock, while hanging a towel and then trying to have a shower did we realised that the hotel was crumbling. After complaining, we were \"upgraded\" to another room - bigger but almost as bad as the other one, including a bathroom door that was too big for its frame - by the senior staff. Even the sparkling water in the minibar was dead! Breakfast was a noisy and unpleasant experience in the days when a patronising and loud member of the staff was present. HF Garden is dearly missed! Covid is no excuse for such incompetence and one would think that without (many) customers it would be the perfect time to make some minor works and improve the place? HF Garden, we miss you!

Old bed that the springs pop though when you lay down the couch is so broken.  Not even a coffee pot in the kitchen.  The view was not a garden more like weeds and broken tiles.
