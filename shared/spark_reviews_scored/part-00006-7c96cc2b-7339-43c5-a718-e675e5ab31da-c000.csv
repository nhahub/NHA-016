Villas Barrocal,jude41045,82,jude41045wrote a review May 2013,"Just returned from a stay at these lovely apartments.  Reception staff were helpful and we were given a 2 bedroom apartment (130) even though we had booked a 1 bed apartment.  The apartment was clean and well furnished and comfortable with everything you would need to cater for yourself.  There is a minimarket (quite small) just outside the gates and fresh bread hot from the oven available at about 830 am. The village is not a tourist spot and is fairly quiet.  We found the market hall (Mercado) in the centre and on the day we were there the stalls were one greengrocers, one fish stall and 2 stalls selling bits and bobs of non food items.  We bought 1kg of strawberries for 2euros 30 and thoroughly enjoyed lunches of strawberries and cream! The pool is not massive but adequate and you could enjoy a swim or sit around on the loungers catching the warm sunshine.  One of our balconies caught the afternoon and evening sun and also looked over to the sea in the distance.  We witnessed some lovely sunsets whilst sipping wine on the balcony.It is a fair walk to the sea and on a warm/hot day there is little shade.  The nearest beach was a lengthy strip of sand accessed by steps over the sand dunes.  A lovely place to sunbathe, however the sea was a little rough to swim in.  We did find a good swimming beach just west of Armacao de Pera, called Senhora de Rocha.  A good place for a swim with a cafe/restaurant serving snacks and meals.  We did have a car and would recommend anyone staying at the apartments to hire a car unless they just wanted to stay around the local area.  Would I go again?  Certainly!! Fantastic value for money.",May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,4

Hotel Madeira,Perpetuatraveller,134,Perpetuatravellerwrote a review Feb 2011,"The hotel's central location is great. Holmes Place gym 2 minutes walk away, Dolce Vita shopping centre with fab supermarket 2 minutes walk away, all the delights of the city and the seafront within very easy walking distance.My room was spacious, immaculately clean, cable tv, 2 balconies, smoking permitted (but having the balconies to smoke on, the room itself didn't smell of smoke), nice bathroom, quiet at night, comfortable bed.Breakfast choices were ample, though simple.Front desk staff were charming.Free use of the (one) computer was great. (wifi said to be available for  4 euros an hour - pricey). My repeated expressions of concern about the hotel computer showing that anti-virus protection wasn't up to date met with no correction of the problem - I was told the Manager had the password, the Manager apparenly wasn't present or available to assist with this,during my 3 night stay, to deal with the issue......But apart from that, I simply couldn't have had a better experience of the hotel, and I will happily return. SIGNIFICANTLY more my sort of place than the huge hotels in the \"Hotel Zone\", which aren't nearly so central.The terrace and small pool on the top floor was attractive.I didn't use the cafe hotel but it looked welcoming.I loved the hotel.",Feb,2011,Feb 2011,2011-02-01,2011,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Tanja G,1,Tanja Gwrote a review Apr 2015,"It has been our second stay at Belmar, cause we liked it so much the first time and again it was toally relaxing and simply a wonderful vacation. The resort is beautifully build, with nice interieur and a warm atmosphere.However I have got some ideas for improvement since I am workwise staying in different hotels each week:- public areas within the resort, like hallways, drinking fountains, glass doors and floors especially within the spa should be cleaned regulary to keep it neat. It is not very pleasant to walk beside the indoor pool with bare feet when the floor is very dirty.- The access to the outdoor pools as well as accessing the road to the beach close-by should be improved e.g. to enter one of the outdoorpools one had to cross the whole spa area.- Small touch-ups on indoor walls that are cracked and repainting outdoor walls should be considered to avoid a worn-down-look.- New and comfortable sun loungers would be great",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4

Hotel Madeira,DLT1642014,19,DLT1642014wrote a review Jun 2016,This hotel is ideally located in Funchal. It has a rooftop pool with sun loungers and friendly bar staff.  Breakfast is provided and is quite varied. Fortunately I like scrambled eggs so I was set for the week. Bit disappointed in Madeira itself. First time there and probably wouldn't go back. Cloudy everyday and got soaked one day coming back from botanical gardens.  Even though Madeira is close to the canaries it doesn't share the same weather.,Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,3

The house is super cozy, the rooms are very bright and with perfect view to the ocean - that's the best part, when you get up in the morning and can see the waves :) In the house you'll find everything what you could need: kitchen with all facilities, a living room to chill, a yard for sun baths, etc. I like the comics drawings all over the house - that makes the place more unique.

The front desk staff was outstanding!We got answers to all our different questions and needs. We even got first aid to back pains from them. They were more than happy to direct us to all the special places in Lisbon.The hotel is very clean and breakfast is good.The location of the hotel is comfortable. The metro station is within two minutes walk  and midtown is 10 minutes away by foot. It is a very nice walk in a beautiful and safe boulevard full with expensive shops like Prada, Armani, Louis Vitton and also Mango and Fly London.We got a very good price from the website of the hotel itself.We really recommend staying there, the hotel made our whole trip to beautiful Lisbon a great success.",Nov,2012,Nov 2012,2012-11-01,2012,5

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Seattletraveler101,94,Seattletraveler101wrote a review May 2015,"We stayed at the Valverde Hotel for four nights. We are frequent travelers and this was one of our favorites. The rooms are nicely furnished and spacious, with comfortable beds.  There was plenty of closet space and drawer space to unpack. The hotel is easy walking distance to the main tourist area. There is a lovely pool located outside on the lower level. But what makes this hotel so special is the staff. We were greeted upon arrival by friendly staff, shown around our room and given a map with explanations of what not to miss. They helped with reservations for dinner, coordination of our picking up a car upon departure, obtaining a driver for a tour of Sintra and always asking how they could help us. They knew our names from the moment we checked in, which is always a plus. Miguel was particularly helpful and made us feel at home right way. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel for anyone staying in Lisbon.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,5

Independente Principe Real,misspickle,213,misspicklewrote a review Jul 2016,"We only spent one night here. To put it into perspective we had four nights Air B&B and our last night here cost the same as four nights there!However, we are paying for the location, we wanted to move just around the corner. Basically for the cost it's not a hotel, our suite no. 3 was €135; here are our thoughts:PRO: nice toiletries, amazing view and roof terrace. Good air con, nice features and furnishings in room. Fantastic buffet breakfast in a beautiful setting.CONS: mould in coffee machine, old, thin, smelly towels. Very little/no privacy on suite roof terrace.Sure the hostel side is nice but we can't comment, if I'd paid €20 for a room I'd be full of superlatives for the breakfast was outstanding, however for the money, as a hotel, we wouldn't recommend.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,2

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Mark B,8,Mark Bwrote a review Jun 2017,"I'm following up separately with the hotel - I'm usually easy going and am not one to bash ... however, when when you don't get near the level you have paid for, you shouldn't just let it go  ...Let's start with the positives ...- Great location, beautiful views and generally quiet but not remote - great for R+R. The recently renovated building and surroundings are beautiful. Its a minimalistic rather than a plush style with that newly renovated feel and hopefully, the standard of the facility we enjoyed will be maintained.- It was relaxing and we didn't run into any major issues although we were locked out of our room with several keys from staff being tired without success - c.30 mins of chaos until a security guard was found with a manual key - these things happen - teething issues with a new system perhaps?The pools were very well maintained and the bars were good. Some (unfortunately only some) staff came across as friendly - should be a given in a hotel calling itself 5 star - something to definitely watch.- The buffet that ran for 1 night of our stay was very enjoyable- The fine dining resturant in terms of food and varietly was good - not great though - I've seen better on several occasions - in this case  certainly better value for money than I was expecting and that's a plus.There were a few too many negatives .....This has to be spelled out - we were assured by the hotel (and I have the email) that the spa and indoor pool facilities would be available on time for our arrival in early June - I appreciate that renovations are a big job and facilities will usually be delayed, never mind ready but neither the spa or pool were available - the spa was only getting ready when we were leaving and we were told by several staff that on arrival that facilities would not be ready during our stay - Why was I told that these facilities would be ready in an email when they were obviously not? - I told the duty manager. She told me she would look up the email as she was aware of it but I haven't heard back from her as yet. Black mark team! - being told clear misinformation like this is not excusable.The non-gourmet (i.e. non-fine dining restaurant) called 'The Med' was not great.Service level was slow and occasionally seemed chaotic - there were only a handful of tables being used during dinner service which we attended every night during our stay as we booked the half-board option.2. More that 90%-95% of the menu in the Med restaurant was fish - yes I like fish but I counted 3 items that were not fish apart from the salads and this was not advertised as a seafood restaurant - guys, that's not the service level you should be giving to entice any half-board reservation! A few couples we happened to be chatting with remarked on the same thing - not surprisingly as it was certainly a conversation starter - the fish soup was not a winner and as for the coconut soup and scoop of sorbet as one of the few desert options - bizarre and definitely not a winner - several guests found this one strange during our stay, not just us!- Sure, the fine dining restaurant had variety but even there, my wife got the wrong dish for her main course - we were happy to accept as the quality of the food was good - not great but good in any case - we've had better on several occasions- I cannot understand with very few diners how mistakes like bringing out the wrong dish can be made? - in our case, ordering veal and receiving steak in what's supposed to be a fine-dining restaurant within a 5 star hotel with a handful of tables occupied -  come on folks!3. The two restaurants shared the same space - not intuitively obvious and the layout was frankly bizarre. Different chairs were the main distinguishing feature along with some customers given an long winded explanation about which restaurant they are in - entertaining to hear at least but frankly bizarre!4. On arrival at the fine dining restaurant ('The One' as its called), the head waiter/maitre'd gave me a sort of bizarre mini-lecture about me not reserving a table, really stressing it was highly advisable to do so even though my wife and I knew there would be very few tables in operation - even if the restaurant was full (hugely unlikely) - we would have been ok to go elsewhere. I'm sure the kitchens were stocked also I would have thought - bizarre and made both of us feel a bit uncomfortable with that sort of greeting - at least he smiled when he spoke - if he didn't, it would have been totally reminiscent of 'Fawlty Towers'5. I'm not keen on being given a long description of your rewards program on check-in. Usually people are a little tired after a journey and don't want a long wait on check in - you are also forced to sign up if you want wifi for free - yep, its a quibble but I don't usually have to do this when I stay in hotels ww.  Check-in should not involve long winded explanations.6. Trying to get anyone's attention at breakfast was not easy - service was chaotic and any additional order beyond the buffet took several attempts as orders were forgotten - on more than one occasion and I really mean several occasions, we would ask 3 different servers for the same request in the hope of 3rd time lucky - assigning waiters to areas would kind of make sense here I would have thought. I'm glad I was on holiday and not on business travel !7. There was no hotel directory in the room, never mind a room service menu - the duty manager told me they were going to use the TVs for this in the near future - it actually should be on paper with an option to display the directory on the TV in your room. In our case, there wasn't anything at all. I had to check fire escape routes manually as there was no notice on the door and nothing printed in the room - guys, sort this out quickly - should be on paper always. Not everyone wants to use a TV (particularly anyone who is old school) and if the TV system fails for any reason, you would be missing some information anyway - this is not difficult to fix!I'm very slow to complain but gave a little feedback with a friendly chat to a friendly and professional duty manager - she took everything on board at least but no follow-up beyond our chat at the time of writing - disappointing.My message to those who are thinking of staying here as well as people who may return -  I've stayed in better hotels that were more efficient and I really would love to see this place tighten up and get better ....I do appreciate that the service industry is tough to achieve excellence in and probably not the best rewarded when you are working yourself up from lower positions but management in particular should really take note - some staff were not good at all and do have adequate training for what is supposed to be superior service. You will run into many issues if you call yourself a 5 star establishment, charge for it and then don't understand, never mind deliver a 5 star service- more and more people these days know what 5 star means and this hotel was clearing lacking the service and attention to detail level that should be a given - We enjoyed ourselves in general but fact is fact - if you want to call yourselves superior, the bar should be high - there were too many 'attention to detail' issues which diluted what we should have got compared to what we paid for.We will browse some more reviews in the future from other guests as well as feedback from the hotel - I don't want to rule us out of coming here to this lovely location in the future but there are better places we couldn't have gone to that I could easily list without even thinking - our expectations were surprisingly not met to the level we were expecting and we were not asking for the earth!",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,3
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,jodistar,17,jodistarwrote a review Jul 2017,"We had a lovely holiday in the TIvoli despite its faults. They are still working round the clock to finish the rooms and facilities, yes there were numerous things I could mention, rooms are quite small compared to other similar grade hotels in Algarve, aircon not very effective on our side of building, many things not working initially in our room but promptly attended to by maintenance staff, this was all probably down to rooms not being checked when finished due to pressure to open. However overall we loved it. The staff here are so nice and very helpful, Marco and the other front desk staff helped me on several matters, Ricardo, Janine in the breakfast room so friendly and nice.

SANA Capitol Hotel,Silvia S,37,Silvia Swrote a review Jul 2013,"I stayed in the hotel for two weeks (July 2013) and it was very nice.It is not a hotel for you to spend the whole day indoor, however it is perfect if you are the kind of tourist that walks during the whole day and just want a good shower and a confortable bed to recharge the energy in the end of the day.The rooms are not big, but have a good cost and benefit, also they are clean and silent.Staff are very nice and helpfull. Breakfast is fair and good (as it does not change too much, you can get used if you stay there for many days).It is very close to the subway and good attractions, you can easily go walking for sightseeing and shopping.I recommend.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,4
Saccharum,lauritasjourney,6,lauritasjourneywrote a review Nov 2020,"We stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon and booked in advance for this stay.We selected the side garden ocean view room and this was clearly our first mistake.When we arrived there was nobody to greet us and we park in the outside parking, that then gave us a ticket. We asked the reception staff and they advised to move the car to their underground parking which was not a big issue.The problem we had was with the room. It had a view of the car park and it was very small. They had provided a wine and some flowers, but didn't make up for the shock of seeing this room.I went downstairs to check if they had another room and because there was a wedding in the building, they had no availability except for a room on the 1st floor.This had an ocean view but also you can hear and see all the people walking down the road or parking in front of you, so no privacy whatsoever.We had planning this honeymoon since April when it got cancelled, we rebooked and I thought carefully before booking this hotel and I was so disappointed.It was suppose to be a special moment for me and my husband and it was a very bad experience.I want to explain why this was a bad experience, when we agreed to move to the room on the 1st floor, they told us it could take a couple of hours as they had to clean it. So I agreed to go for lunch and come back in some hours to check in. As we had all our bags in 734 they offered kindly to move all out things into the new room 106.When we were having lunch, we were informed the room was ready, so we headed to reception got the new keys, but then Patricia informed us our belongings were still in 734. this left me very confused. I therefore went to the room to collect my things and someone came to help us shortly after I was in the lift with my bags. I asked him if he could bring the remaining bags and the wine, but misunderstanding happened and he just left. This situation added to general negative feeling of the hotel.We decided to turn the page, drink the wine and move forward and headed to the infinite pool, we didn't know where to get towels from so we asked someone in the restaurant area. He told me I shouldn't ask him for towels and could get him in so much trouble and that they are in the room. I told him I did not see them in the room and he brought me some, but then again left me feeling frustrated as I had previously stayed in a different savoy where towels were provided by the pool, so if nobody tells me when I check in, is this how it should be communicated?on the next day we went out for the day, came back at 4pm and the room wasn't cleaned, again this is not a major issue but when we Called reception, they told me I'm sure you forgot to put the sign as I was being accused. It was just a very weird experience. the housekeeper came as I was on the phone and was so apologetic about the whole situation.I think what really got to me was the smell in the room, it had sewer smell. I reported the reception but nobody came to the room, not even an apology over the phone when I mentioned this. It was shocking.The breakfast service was a bit disorganised, I would suggest giving people tongs to get food (like they do at Savoy Palace). it allows them to toast their own bread and makes everything a bit more covid safe (in my opinion).For the omelette lady to be toasting bread is appalling. Most morning she was so busy, I felt guilty asking her to give me a toast. It didn't seem to me like great working conditions, and it seems like there was extra staff needed when I was there.The infinite pool is outstanding, best feature of this hotel and the Trapiche restaurant food was very good. We had lunch here twice and really enjoyed it.Drinks by the pool were also good.Overall our stay was average and we were disappointed with the way staff handle several issues, specially regarding the room (which we paid for the upgrade) and the smell which was horrible.",Nov,2020,Nov 2020,2020-11-01,2020,2
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,JonathanRochester,9,JonathanRochesterwrote a review Jul 2016,"We really enjoyed this hotel.  The service was perfect.  The rooms were older, but VERY VERY clean.  I liked the views from the hotel and the pool area.  There were plenty of beach lounge chairs always set up and available on site around the very clean pool.  The included breakfast buffet in the mornings was fresh and even included a waffle and omelet station!  Our breakfast was included in our stay and is highly recommended!  The hotel also offered a spectacular top floor outdoor restaurant with optional dinner buffet.  The cost was approx $23 Euro per person but the food and views were amazing.  The local beaches were spectacular, and free hotel shuttle service was offered to 2 of the local beaches several times a day.  We had booked via Expedia and it took the staff at the front desk about 15 minutes to locate our reservation.  Be sure to call ahead to confirm to save some time if you book via a third party website.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Ivoryslee,54,Ivorysleewrote a review Apr 2019,"Belmond Reid’s Palace hotel is a wonderful experience. Here is a place where you can really relax and enjoy life to the full.We found without exception the staff were pleased to help and seemed happy and courteous in their duties.The Belmond Reid’s Palace is indeed a Palace and has been added to sympathetically over the years . The main result being the lift system requires an intimate knowledge of the hotel as the front door is on the 6th floor . If your room is in the garden wing overlooking the pools and garden then it’s 0 to go to breakfast and off to another lift round the corner and 0 again to arrive at the poolside  restaurant where you can eat outside if the weather is fine. If you want to meet people at the main entrance then it’s 1 on the bottom lift and 5 on the second and walk through wonderful reception rooms near the bridge and billiards rooms and up the carpeted stairs on the left  to the bar on the 6thfloor (this avoids waiting for the slow old lift from the 5th to the 6th) and through to the concierge and the front hall.Eating is fun. Tea on the terrace wonderful finger sandwiches  and you can have seconds, scones as light as a feather with butter Jam and cream and then the sensational patisserie. Champagne if you want and a choice renowned tea.We went to the “William “ restaurant for the sweetest lobster ever. If we weren’t feeling hungry then small meals are available from the bar .In the grounds to the left of the front door as you exit there is a short path to The Cipriani restaurant with lovely sea views ( booking essential via customer relations desk) the dinner bill. can be charged to your room very good food..... the sauce for the duck was memorable.Things to do, virtually anything you can think of can be arranged there are three pools and a fitness centre and a daily program of trips even riding around in a Rolls or a 4x4.Madeira has some of the steepest hill roads known to manand plenty of hairpin bends so unless you are used to this sort of driving it is best left to the professional drivers who are extremely skilful especially reversing up hill.As with All semitropical islands the flowers and plants are really wonderful and the orchids are out of this world.Children have plenty to do such as being a “Pirate” on the Santa Maria replica sailing ship which does sail.This is a truly great holiday place but non slippy walking shoes are essential.Ivory S",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4
Royal Savoy Hotel,Craig G,9,Craig Gwrote a review Jan 2016,"The hotel was beautiful and just outside of the center of the city. Our room had a small kitchen, nicely decorated, and comforting. But we did have some issues with the services while we staying at the hotel. The issues were not horrible, but they did add up and should have not happened considering it was an expensive hotel.First the remote(which is the only way to work the TV) didn't work so we called the front desk and a maintenance man came up, but to fix the problem he flipped the batteries over. This fixed the issue for about a day so we called again and after an hour and a half we called again and they finally gave us new batteries. At a 50 Euro a person Christmas buffet they would not serve us coffee which was being served in the bar 25 10 meters away. The room service menu was missing most of the pages. And to top off the trip we prepaid for 400 Euros worth of food and drinks to get an additional 60 Euros. But when we checked out they said that the prepayment did not cover the 5 Euro room service charges so even though we spent less than the 460 Euros that we prepaid, we had to pay additional Euros at checkout.",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,2

Hotel Gat Rossio,jentheqoe,100,jentheqoewrote a review Dec 2017,"We were booked in this hotel as part of a Groupon package so didn't have a choice, and I'm not sure what the regular room rates are for the size room we were given, but if I had known the true size of the room we were assigned I would have tried to upgrade. It was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in, and about the size of my master-bedroom closet at home. Barely enough room to move around the bed and not much storage area. And it got a little stuffy, but we were able to open with window which overlooked the street. That was nice, until about 4am when they start rolling carts down the street. I thought maybe all the rooms were like ours but when we were leaving on the last day, we got a peek in the room next door and it was much bigger. Despite the room size, I did like the hotel, it's very cute and cozy. Strict check-in and check-out times but they have a lounge area with vending machines, patio and restroom you can use while waiting, and they will store your luggage if you want to explore the City (which we did). Breakfast room is set up cafeteria style, with long tables. Food was good but the same every day, would have appreciated a little variety.  Staff was very good about re-stocking the food and cleaning the tables. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and so helpful. Front desk was especially helpful with suggestions for outings and restaurants. The location of this hotel is probably the best part, it is close to everything we wanted to visit. Just a few minutes walk will get you to the Rossio train station, a couple of different metro stations, and tram stops. Also close to Rua Augusta, Avenida de Liberdade, and so many other things. In summary, I would stay here again (for the location if nothing else) but would have to get a room upgrade if the price was right.",Dec,2017,Dec 2017,2017-12-01,2017,3

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Stockrom,101,Stockromwrote a review Sep 2018,"Hotel appears on arrival to be in a little industrialised area but  it is not it is perfectly located for a stroll into the vibrant town of Tavira.The Hotel is typically Portuguese some paintwork is tradition colours which can look dated but they are keeping that style, the hotel is very clean, all corridors are immaculate, rooms are of good size, very clean, my only gripe would be they need more drawer space for longer stays.Rooms are cleaned each day, fresh linen and towels.Pool area free towels are offered from the spa, plenty of sunbeds no need to reserve although the odd dip sticks did, pool is clean and tidy, odd few small tiles missing but generally in good order, some activities Aquafit, polo were available for those who like this kind of thing.Kids there were plenty of things for teenagers to do around the hotel, a kids club for those with younger children.Food quality and choice was good, breakfast had a good choice of hot/ cold foods, we only had one evening buffet meal, the choice on that night was very good plenty of seafood, and traditional Portuguese fare.Would recommend if looking for a good location as Tavira is fabulous, plenty of very good restaurants and lots of free entertainment groups, singers and musicians. At the back of the hotel is a traditional fish and vegetable market which is very interesting also on the side you can sea the salt flats, and a warehouse where the salt is stored ready for processing.I would recommend booking a pool view room as outer rooms have roads all around the hotel, but not too busy.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,4
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Geraldine O,4,Geraldine Owrote a review Mar 2018,"The stand out on this hotel is definitely the concierge/customer service. All three people that advised us during our stay (Innes, Rita, Ricardo) were very knowledgeable and really made our stay time-efficient with their tips on how to get about and what to see. It was my husbands birthday and having asked for a recommendation for a special restaurant for dinner we then came back from our day in the town to find that Innes had organised a cake and card to be delivered to the room which was a really lovely and unexpected touch.The rooms are spacious and well equipped and of a high standard and we did not experience any noise. The rooftop bar has great views and is worth visiting. Breakfast is only buffet, no cooked to order menu or egg station but there are plenty of options. We had a spa visit included in our package but this turned out to be the public gym and pool which wasn't particularly appealing - the gym is really well equipped but I wouldn't rate it as five star standard. The confusing part was that there is a really nice spa but this wasn't what was included so you need to have a treatment or pay 10 euro to access. We decided to go ahead and the standard was really good and the prices were reasonable - I just think it should be clearer about which is included to set expectations correctly. Location is a little away from the main town but its near a bus stop (either tourist bus or regular is really convenient and easy) and taxis are not particularly expensive to get in to town. I would highly recommend this hotel as an option for its overall standard, service and facilities.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,4

Casa da Tita,Piotr,2,Piotrwrote a review Oct 2019,"Casa da Tita is one of the nicest guesthouses that weâ€™ve ever stayed. It consists of two building: one with several rooms and apartments and the other one with additional apartments, as well as the reception and the dining room. Both: private and common spaces are very nicely decorated and furnished with old items and furniture or new ones but fitting to the rustic style. There is also a swimming pool, 1,40 m deep so quite reasonable for swimming.We chose the Granary Apartment. It consists of two rooms: the first is primarily the kitchen with a fridge, a cooker, a microwave oven, an electric kettle and a coffee machine using delta-discs (provided daily). All necessary dishes and cutlery are also available. There is also a dining table and a single bed (though dual usage of the room as a kitchen and a bedroom may not be that comfortable). In main bedroom thereâ€™s a big and comfortable bed, a wardrobe and a desk. This room is airconditioned, thereâ€™s also a TV. In the bathroom thereâ€™s a big walk in shower and weâ€™ve never experienced any shortages of warm water (what was the case in some other places that we stayed). The room is cleaned daily, what is certainly beyond the standard for such guesthouses.Before the arrival we got the list of various activities, from sightseeing to visiting the local diary, in which one can participate if wish so. Thereâ€™s variety, so virtually everyone can find something interesting for him/herself. Some are free, some other paid but usually really little. Upon arrival the owner was waiting for us to provide all necessary information and offer a welcome drink (of any chosen kind), he also accompanied us daily during breakfast and chats with him were always a pleasure. The breakfasts are very decent, beyond typical products like cheese, ham and cereals there are also some local products, fresh homegrown fruits and homemade jams. Everything really tasty.We found the location of the guesthouse very convenient for us, as the place is peaceful and quiet. Itâ€™s located in a small village next to a local road with really little traffic. One can go hiking or for a bike ride in the area, while the closes beach is like half an hour of driving.Thereâ€™s virtually nothing that one can complain about. One has only to take into account that reaching Casa da Tita without a car (or a bike or some other own transportation) may be difficult as only few buses daily serve the village, while the closest shops and restaurants are 5 km away in the town of Salir (in Nave do Barao thereâ€™s only one small coffee bar).",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,4

We tried 3 of the restaurants as well as the buffet.  The food at each location wouldn't receive more than 1 star from me.    The Portuguese staff were friendly, but some of the other staff were not.  We were not allowed to check into our room until 5 pm,  there was no complimentary coffee and tea.  The kettle didn't open, and the bathroom door wouldn't close.  They resolved it by getting the door to close 90% and gave us a coffee percolator instead.  There was no nightly entertainment; in fact, there was none.  Although other food options and possibly entertainment may be offered by their sister hotels, it is all uphill to get there.

Pousada Viseu,Courrieu,89,Courrieuwrote a review Feb 2020,"This imposing hotel, the former Viseu city hospital, is a mixed bag of experiences. From the outside the historic building is grand overlooking the city. Inside the enormous awesome atrium acts as bar and general sitting area. The rooms however are very standard. Modern and rather sterile with a very small bathroom. Since all rooms have their doors coming out unto the atrium it can be noisy with weekend music. The breakfast is OK with plenty of choice but the quality of a number of items needs improving. For instance, scrambled egg is completely tasteless and the cold meats choice leaves much to be desired. Fried eggs have to be paid for extra! For a hotel which claims to be of highest standard these points need improvement.The staff is very attentive, friendly and helpful. However, check your payment because in our case we were charged double despite the fact that the receptionist confirmed at checkout that we had already paid.But, by all means stay in this Pousada and enjoy the great historic city of Viseu which has so much to offer.",Feb,2020,Feb 2020,2020-02-01,2020,4
