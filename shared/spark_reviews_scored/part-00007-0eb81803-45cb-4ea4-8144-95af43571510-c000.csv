Quinta Mirabela,coolandcrunchie,78,coolandcrunchiewrote a review Feb 2005,"We returned home on the 31st January 2005, having enjoyed a fantastic week in Madeira.  The hotel was disappointing in that we'd expected some of the original character of the old building to still be apparent, but it wasn't.  It's ultra modern throughout.  An interior designer has obviously been employed to furnish and decorate the place, which looks fantastic, but very much at the expense of comfort!!  Lots of wierd shaped settees and chairs, but not one seat in the entire hotel that you can simply slouch in and read a book and relax in (the only comfortable seats were on the landings, but who wants to relax on a landing???).  No lounge area, just a couple of \"settees\" in the bar in the restaurant.  There is a games room down in the basement, which leads to a very well equipped gym and pool area, which we didn't use as it wasn't really hot enough.We had dinner in the hotel once, and the food was delicious, but we were the only people in the restaurant, so not much atmosphere.We had one of the larger rooms in the main building, but again, a couple of niggles.  Huge room, beautifully decorated, but very poor use of space.  No full length mirror, only one chair and no table (what you are supposed to if you order a full three course meal from room service is anyone's guess - sit and eat it on the bed I suppose!).  Again, nowhere to sit and chill.  No tea and coffee making facilities (BIG black mark in my book), and the dressing table was squashed into a tiny area by the main door, where you had to have the light on all the time if you wanted to use the mirror.The hotel is located up a steep hill; the views over the bay of Funchal are to die for.  The road is the one used by the famous toboggans.  You have to get transport into Funchal.  The walk would have been lengthy, and very steep (a killer on the knees!).  We never tried it.  The Quinta Mirabella operates a courtesy bus but at fixed times only - they may not suit your itinerary (to Funchal 1030 & 1500, from Funchal 1330 & 1700).  Local buses run on those roads running perpendicular to the one the hotel is on; bus stops are near the crossroads both downhill and uphill from the hotel.The walk up the hill to Monte (very pretty, where the cable car ride begins, and there are cafes, gardens, walks etc) is VERY steep, and takes about 40 minutes on a good day with lots of rests - it's relentless!  But exhilerating nonetheless (we are in our 40s).  The toboggan run begins from here too, so you can always get one back to the hotel, as they whizz right past the gate (cost is E20 per couple).Taxis into Funchal centre will cost around E8 - E10, as they have to come up to take you back down (their justification, not mine!!).  Returning shouldn't cost more than E7, but make sure you agree a price before setting off, otherwise they can charge as much as E10.  Taxis are supposed to use the meter but sometimes \"conveniently\" forget to switch it on (those that do so sometimes take circuitous routes).If you find a good taxi driver, take his number, as we did.  Some drivers make excellent tour guides & have done their homework on the geography, flora, fauna etc and if you strike up a good relationship might prove more cost-effective than taking one of the organised tours (especially if there are 4 of you).The restaurants in the old town (just beyond the Cable Car station on the sea front) are FANTASTIC.  We ate at different restaurants every night, and never had a bad meal.  Ladies take heed - don't wear your high heels around this area, the pavements and streets are all cobbled.Madeira is very much what you make it.  If you want a beach holiday you won't find it - there are no beaches on the island.  The busy, touristy high rise hotels, bars, casinos, shopping malls etc are all on the west side of Funchal, beyond the marina.  For those wanting good food in more traditional surroundings head for the old town on the East side.And for those who enjoy walking and superb scenery, as we do, you MUST try the Levada walks (plenty of websites on these).  Incredible views, fantastic walking and well worth the effort.  Take a guide book though before setting off, as it can be easy to get lost on some of them -there are plenty of books on levada walks in good book shops.  If you are planning to walk, take walking boots, cagoules and a torch (for the occasional tunnel).  And make sure that some part of your trip takes in the Encumeada Pass - the scenery there will take your breath away.WARNING: some levada walks have sheer drops to one side, occasionally with no railings.  If you have a good head for heights, marvel at the views and the feats of those who built them.  If not, tread carefully!  Do your research and take advice from locals - including taxi drivers, after all, they want you to come back too!!Enjoy your stay - we did, and are already planning our return trip!",Feb,2005,Feb 2005,2005-02-01,2005,2
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,MariaLetiziaGrasso,38,MariaLetiziaGrassowrote a review Jan 2024,"Everything was very nice and pleasant, the rooms and double bed were comfortable, the rooms were very clean, the whole environment was well looked after. Arrived at the facility in the evening, in early January, a fairly quiet period, in reality everything was very lively and well-kept. Breakfast worthy of note, with an infinite choice of specialties. Unfortunately we were on a traveling trip and we only stayed one day, guests of the hotel.. Next time I'll organize myself for a few more days of true relaxation!!",Jan,2024,Jan 2024,2024-01-01,2024,4

Vila Gale Porto Ribeira,healthyappetite2015,20,healthyappetite2015wrote a review Oct 2018,Functional rooms but the hotel is friendly and very clean. It felt a little corporate but it was quiet at night and we liked the location. Very near the tram stops if you want to hop on. But we enjoyed the walks along the river into town (about 20 minutes). It is near to the tourist helipad but they only go during the day and we were out walking around all day so that wasn't a problem. Breakfast is good. Nice helpful hotel staff. Would happily recommend.,Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

Lisbon Destination Hostel,nonamewilldo,38,nonamewilldowrote a review Nov 2014,"Hard to find anything bad to say about this hostel. It's reasonably priced and excellently located at Rossio train station, which means all of Lisbon's central sights are within walking distance. Trains to Sintra depart just a few meters from the door of the hostel, and trams to Belem go from the square immediately beside Rossio.We found the staff very helpful and friendly. They organise all sorts of excursions, and there's plenty of entertainment in the hostel, including the likes of pool, cards and a film room. They also serve food and have a fridge stocked with Super Bock and vino!The hostel is obviously a very popular choice with travellers so you are bound to meet people in the large communal area. We did not have an en suite in our room, but there are communal toilet/shower facilities that are kept clean.Delighted we chose to stay at Destination and would definitely choose it again should I return to Lisbon.",Nov,2014,Nov 2014,2014-11-01,2014,5
PortoBay Serra Golf,Dalreen B,17,Dalreen Bwrote a review Mar 2014,"We were part of a group of 8 friends and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel.  We usually stay at the main hotel in Funchal but tried this for a change.  At this time of year as the hotel is in one of the villages in the hills the weather was mixed but it is a lovely place to walk from, play golf or just chill. We found the menu  a little restricted but the food was excellent.  Would definitely return for a 3 or 4 night relaxing break.",Mar,2014,Mar 2014,2014-03-01,2014,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Joleesta,9,Joleestawrote a review Apr 2025,"Having Traveled around a lot I have to say Never Book Full Boarding at this hotel I would strongly advise you to go half boarding here.I am Honestly in saying The Staff First Class. The Rooms were spotless Very Disappointing with the Tv Having it’s named after MGM and looks to be controlled it what we have to watch first place I have never had Sky News !!? I am an early riser and like to have a few uk channels with Subtitles in English specifically the News Channel for all the UK so that we can see what’s happening back home so that I don’t waken up the Neighbours in all the rooms around ours.The Hotel itself is spotless can’t fault it at all.The Biggest Downside is for what You get for Being A Full board Guest ,The main course at lunch and evening meals is very very poor plus it’s either COLD OR WARM. And the choice u have is not good at all Sorry !!My last meal was Beef stew 🥘 again just a little warm and the Beef was be like eating through rubber I spat it out and I left the whole plate.We went out just about every day for lunch and evening meals as they were far more popular and enjoyable to enjoy plus they were not expensive.As if you Have the Drinks package  you will be very Disappointed for what they offer you it’s very very poor and one of the worst we have come across Even the Vodka has the company branded name on it MGM 🤦‍♂️. If you are a Whisky 🥃,Or Beer 🍺 Drinker look out. The pool side cafe is absolutely bare and never has anything simple in it when u ask 🤦‍♂️Honestly Don’t know who’s gives out these star Ratings for hotels As this is only about a 3 star. Best advice is look around first.",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,3
Lisbon Happy Hostel,Agata B,6,Agata Bwrote a review Mar 2015,"The hostel is pefectly located, you can reach most main attraction on foot and it will only take 20 min or so.Bairro Alto and it's many restaurant and bars are also within walking distance.The beds were very confortable, the rooms where clean and we were also provided with towels, which was a nice touch for a hostel. The bathroom, is very tiny. I'm 5ft 6inch and I barely touched the door of the bathroom when sitting on the loo, but the shower cubicle is big enough and pressure end temperature are good, it was also very clean and tidy.The kitchen was clean and essentially furniced. Breadfast is minimal with bread, butter, jam, cereals and milk, coffe and various teas. but it was all we needed so it was perfect for us.As many others have said the hostel is hard to find and you do have to go up 3 floors fo stairs, but this didn't cause much trouble for us.The girls running the hostel were very nice and were happy to look after our bags after we had checked out.The only note i have is the we staid in room 305, the hostel is very quiet if the windows are closed, once we opened the window there was a big kitchen fan outside which was on all the time. so a little annoying in the end. but not enough to keep us awake.All in all good and I would return if i visited Lisbon again.",Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,4
Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,Joanna_Koltan,182,Joanna_Koltanwrote a review Aug 2017,"This hotel has great location with amazing view. Stay aware that it is best to travel to here by boat and leave the boat on public Cais do Ferrão or by train.By car you get stuck in a difficult location to go to nearby Régua or Pinhao.The pool is the worst of the property, poorly maintained, dirty with green water. Our children didn't want to swim inside unfortunately and with such a view, little could be done to improve it.The food is great and you will not get disappointed though even if staying at the hotel, you will have to pay extra for wine tasting what usually is included. The wine tasting is from about 20 to 50€ and you get little for what you pay.The pool towels were not changed during 4 days of our stay, some arrangements were handled at the reception but as for Neighbourhood quintas we were used to more eficient reception.The rooms have good pillows and cushions.The place itself is very nice and it is a pity that it is not explored better way.Some workers were very nice and made our stay special ( Maria Fonseca and the drivers !)Be prepared that here you carry your own luggage; the breakfast has little options and that luxury in the title is mainly a title.3 stars probably would be correct intl rating.If you are a fan of douro, for sure you will want to stay here but if it is one and only short stay than choose quinta do valado, quinta do pego or quinta da marka.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,3

A Casa Formosa,champion51,69,champion51wrote a review Oct 2012,"We had a real mess finding this place as there are 3 Casa Formosa's listed on Google. It was a non residing owner and the place had  a very unlived in feeling. There were no pictures on the walls and altho the beds were comfortable it seemed rather odd to be staying there without a host. Real coffee would be a good thing to have on hand, not instant. We did like the owner tho, he did his best to make our stay pleasant. A huge downside tho is that it cost us 24 Euros to park for a day and a half as there was no parking on the street.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,3
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Martin B,7,Martin Bwrote a review Sep 2016,"Just got back from 2 Weeks at the Forte Do Vale Hotel. This post is more for the Information of Infinity Members, as most of the reviews comment about the poor food of All Inclusive Jet 2 Holiday People. I've had the benefit of going on Holiday with my family who for many years belong to the Infinity Club Membership with access to the now MGM group of various Hotels. My Advice to all Infinity Members who wish to got to this hotel....1: This hotel is great for Self Catering & location is between Albufeira & and the strip.2: The Infinity Rooms are well equipped for Self Catering & Come with Air Con & good cooking & washing equipment.3: If you wish to use the Pool then do so at you own risk. The Pool in my opinion is dangerous & would be closed for Health & safety reasons in the UK as per the pictures I put to this post. Broken Tiles in & around the pool area. You will cut your feet very easy.4: If your hoping to sleep in & get a Sun Bed.... Think Again.There are not enough Sun Beds & the majority of them are broken. 8am in the Morning the the Door opens the the Pool area & the Carling Black Label race for SunBeds begins Lol.5: We listened to complaint after complaint about the Food from Package Holiday members but can't comment on the Food myself. The Town of Albufeira has many Fantastic restaurants & cafes. Eat out & support the local economy because the locals work for it.I not going to waste my time writing a long post as some do write a essay about the hotel. As Infinity Members we will not be going back as Oura View & CPO are much better Hotels & our Feedback has been passed to the Rep at the CPO to pass to MGM.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,2
1e Carvoeiro,alan986,50,alan986wrote a review Feb 2013,"We have just returned from a week's holiday staying in the Monte Carvoiero apartments.  We arrived January 24th and naturally, due to the time of year, the complex was very quiet. The check-in at reception was smooth and efficient and the receptionist was helpful and friendly.  She made our day by telling us that we had been upgraded to a two bedroomed apartment.  We didn't expect such luxury given that we'd bought the holiday via a deal from KGB.  The apartment surpassed our expectations.  It was huge!  Downstairs was a big hall which led to a well-equipped kitchen with some teas, coffees and milks for us to have before we went out and did some shopping. The second bedroom was downstairs with a large built in wardrobe.  Also downstairs was a toilet/shower room. And then there was a large dining and living area with a television, showing a variety of channels many of which were British. Big glass doors led out onto a big wraparound terrace with tables and chairs.  The inside floors were all marbled. Downstairs was brilliant but upstairs was even better.  The stairs led to a massive bedroom, large bed, more built in wardrobes and another terrace you could walk out on to with sun loungers.  The bathroom had a bath/shower and double hand basins, all marble topped. My wife and I were truly amazed and delighted at our good luck.  The first night we kept expecting someone to come and tell us there had been a mistake and we should never have been put in the apartment.  We could see the pool from our room but this was being renovated.  I have to say this didn't concern us at all because although the weather was warmer than we expected it still wasn't warm enough for us to go swimming.  The apartment was spotlessly clean and during the whole time we were there it was very quiet, both these things can make or break a holiday for my wife but she was more than happy. Again, due to the time of year some of the complex amenities were closed, but Tiffany's bar was open  as was the O Saymao restaurant. We used this restaurant on our first night and the food was varied, fresh and reasonably priced.  Every member of staff we met who worked at the complex was helpful and friendly.  We were dreading the timeshare \"chat\" but even that only amounted to a very quick question about whether we'd ever consider living abroad.  We said yes, but not in Portugal and that was that.  The guy just accepted this and then changed the subject to information about the local scenery and places to visit. We found Carvoeiro itself only a five minute walk away and there are many restaurants and bars along here which overlook the sea. I couldn't fault anything at all and we definitely plan to go back.",Feb,2013,Feb 2013,2013-02-01,2013,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Happytraveller772,88,Happytraveller772wrote a review Jul 2017,Standard Marriott hotel with a pool close to the airport (10 - 15 minutes by taxi). Not walking distance to main tourist areas so another taxi journey is required which depending on traffic could be 10-20 minutes into the city. Choose carefully if you want to be closer to the main tourist area. Taxis are plentiful though and I never had to wait. Check in and check out was very busy and a long queue but perhaps due to the peak holiday season. Comfortable bed and nice room decor. Close to a main road so maybe the pool facing rooms are better. Depending on which runway is being used and the wind direction you can hear the aircraft taking off but this should not be a major problem. Breakfast was good. The most annoying aspect of my stay was the charge for wifi which was also really slow. Even budget hotels offer free wifi so when a Marriott hotel at 250€ per night charges for access this feels a bit of a rip off and puts me off.,Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,3
Quinta do Furão,smallportions,117,smallportionswrote a review Oct 2013,"Stayed two nights in this modern hotel - one of the more expensive of 10 visited outside of Funchal at about £150 per night B&B but provided the pool robes, quality toiletries,bedtime biscuits etc. Nice grounds with clifftop walk, and reconstructed traditional home, and good restaurant. Small indoor pool with part roll-back glass roof, jacuzzi etc, and tables set for games. Excellent buffet breakfast that was well topped-up, but with limited sitting area inside (it can be a chilly wind or cloudy in the morning in October). Ate well and with attentive service on terrace of restaurant on first night ; on second tried to seek out alternatively in Santana- there is not really anything as the town caters for daytime day visitors- the Tripadvisor suggestion is little more than a cafe/bar- and empty in the evening. So we tried hotel restaurant a second night eating inside at about 8.30pm - a far poorer experience as we waited over 50 mins for two simple first courses in what was now a nearly desserted restaurant as terrace tables were empty, and another 30 mins for mains. The organic chicken was off but an alternative non organic bird was offered (I notice no price reduction on bill)- restaurant prices on the high side for Madeira outside Funchal.

We arranged an airport transfer in advance and were given quick and helpful support with a few questions before we arrived.When we walked in we were extremely impressed.. the hotel is stunning and I love the literary concept seen throughout. The reception area and library are beautiful as you will see from pictures, as well as the gorgeous stairway and glass ceiling!The staff really made this hotel and our visit. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by name (before even checking in!) And the staff throughout remembered you and took the time to say hello and wish you a good day, or ask if anything was needed.The breakfast staff were incredible, Louise, Mario and colleagues we cannot thank you enough for your service and hospitality. Little things like remembering our coffee and hot chocolate order meant a lot!! You and the rest of the staff are an absolute asset to the hotel and I can't thank and commend you enough.Our room was beautiful.. a nice little balcony which I'm sure is perfect during better weather.  I also really liked the fact that you get an actual key to open your room door.. no worries about key cards needed resetting or being locked out!  Our only issue was with storage space. We didn't have much room to unpack our luggage, and in the bathroom there was very limited space for toiletry bags. It meant we kept a lot in our suitcases and had to bring them out when needed.. it meant we didn't quite feel settled and for a longer stay I think this would cause some issues. We did unfortunately have issues with rhe plug in out sink too. We reported it but came back to find it was just removed instead of being fixed, leaving us without a fully functioning sink for the rest of our stay. The reception staff were apologetic on check out.Location of the hotel is perfect for walking and exploring Porto.. it was honestly so nice to come back to this hotel after a long day of walking. The warm welcome and atmosphere of the hotel made it a truly unforgettable trip.",Jan,2024,Jan 2024,2024-01-01,2024,5

You can swim in the sea easily by using the steps down to the water.This is the perfect place to relax and wind down. It was hot but not too hot due to the pleasant breeze.

PortoBay Liberdade,FunBoyOne,62,FunBoyOnewrote a review Jan 2025,"We spent three nights here for a long weekend in Lisbon. It’s well located at the top of Liberdade Ave which is full of up market hotels and designer shopping. It’s a half hour taxi ride from the airport. There’s a couple of Metro stops a few mins walk each way up or down the avenue. It’s downhill to the main central areas and uphill on the way back(!). We had one of the smaller Classic rooms, which was fine, with a good power shower and a small Juliette style balcony. We got a discount on the room and drinks etc as we had previously stayed at their excellent hotel in Porto and had signed up with their membership programme. There’s a nice pool and spa area which is open most of the day. The service is efficient and friendly and all with excellent English to counter our non-existent Portuguese. The breakfast has a very wide choice on the buffet (some of the best scrambled eggs I’ve had, that avoided the trap of drying out) and with cook to order eggs, pancakes etc. We did have some minor blips - drilling noise in our room on the Friday afternoon from nearby construction, lack of hot water on Sunday morning and the not unusual late mini-bar charge that was swiftly refunded - however, it wouldn’t stop us recommending the hotel.We went on a very good food walking tour with Secret Food Tours on the Friday morning which was enjoyable and helped orientate us. We had excellent pasta nearby at Il Mercato and a good late Sunday lunch at A Cozinha (slightly quirky) which is 5 mins away. We would also recommend Invicta Madragoa, but ensure you book as it only has 15 or so covers and perhaps take an uber as it’s a bit out of the way.",Jan,2025,Jan 2025,2025-01-01,2025,4
Royal Savoy Hotel,Ian F,146,Ian Fwrote a review Oct 2017,"The Royal Savoy is a distinguished, classical style hotel positioned within a short 10 minute stroll from Funchal centre. This is our 3rd visit to Funchal having previously stayed at The Cliff Bay and Vidamar. We think that The Savoy pips the other two mainly due to being closer to the town.On arrival we were greeted at reception and were shown to a ground floor Junior Suite room which we quickly requested to be changed to an upper floor room. Catia did her best for us and happily managed to get us a 4th floor room the next day. Whilst the ground floor rooms had good access to all amenities we felt that the upper floor rooms had better sea views.Overall the hotel is very good and has everything you might expect of it's 5 star rating. The furniture and fittings are of excellent high quality and clearly expensive albeit slightly gentlemen's club and old school. Nevertheless, all mod cons are available in the rooms including tea making, flat screen tv and iron and board. The shower and bathroom facilities were excellent and the bed, pillow and bedding were really comfortable.We spent all of our evenings away from the hotel so cannot comment on the dining experience, bar or entertainment. We tended to eat out at the good selection of restaurants in the vicinity and can recommend Casa de Penha (100 yards away) and La Pasta (in Funchal centre).  Bar wise we would recommend The Hole in One, Prince Albert and Moynihans.This hotel had the most friendly atmosphere of any of the hotels we have frequented.  As well as the staff, the clientele almost always said hello when passing and started up conversations really easily making you feel welcome.The lido and pool areas are really well managed by Emanuel and quite easily accessed.  There is an unheated pool, a heated pool, an indoor pool, a jacuzzi and a children’s pool. There is still a bit of a race to put free issue hotel towels on the sunbeds in the morning which is a tad unfortunate but there was always ample sunbeds to go round.Bring your snorkelling gear as the sea water has a large array of interesting and colourful aquatic life which is within easy reach of the hotel quayside.The new hotel is being constructed to the hotel frontage but this in no way had any impact on our enjoyment of the hotel or facilities. We enjoyed our 10 days at The Savoy and can see why it costs a bit more to stay here.  This is probably not a hotel suitable for young couples as the clientele is more senior, possibly because there were a lot of timeshare owners here.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,4
Saccharum,Will J,0,Will Jwrote a review Sep 2024,"Pros:The hotel itself is very nice to look at, there’s no denying that:- Rooftop area is amazing- Great views- Food and drink are nice- Rooms are pretty decentCons:- The Spa is very average and you’ll have to pay 30 euros to use it …- The gym is poor for a 5* hotel- The reception and corridors are too dark- It’s silly having to go down all the way to reception to then have to go back up to the 2nd floor to get to breakfastI think the main issue with the hotel is the service / lack of it. You’re paying £250/300 per night for a 5 star hotel. There’s no pool service at all, you have to pay 10 euros a night for car parking (this is ridiculous by the way), the reception staff aren’t friendly at all (very similar to the check in/ check out experience you’d get at a premier inn), no welcome drinks even though the reservation email says so. When you compare this to their sister hotel (savoy palace in Funchal, which is also similarly priced) it’s a different world and the staff there couldn’t do enough for you from the moment you step into the building, which makes this stay all the more disappointing. I wanted to like it but ultimately the experience let it down.We stayed in a 4 star hotel on the north of the island before we came here - the service was far better than this and it was roughly half the price! My advice is, come here and stay for a night or two if you want to take some nice photos, but don’t expect anything close to a 5 star service and be prepared to pay for any extras!",Sep,2024,Sep 2024,2024-09-01,2024,3

The buffet was very expensive and dull so we ate out having tried it once, and you can eat better food at all the local restaurants more cheaply . The pool was constantly windy and not enough chairs were put out for the guests. We could never recommend this place, or Poches.

Canto de Luz,Ash C,0,Ash Cwrote a review Jul 2023,"We almost hate to write this review because we want there to be a room here for us next time we visit, but this place is special and we cannot thank Susan and her amazing crew enough for our perfect stay at Canto de Luz! Susan was in touch with us on WhatsApp very shortly after we made our reservation and provided us with lots of information to make our check-in as smooth as possible. We took the metro from the airport, and the house is just a 3-5 minute walk from the Trindade station. Very convenient! We were welcomed by Micaela when we arrived in the evening and she made us feel like we were walking into our own kitchen in our dream home, offering us tea, wine, and water. We stayed here for four nights during our honeymoon and they surprised us with some delicious chocolates and a beautiful handwritten card when we got back the first day. It was such a special added touch.The breakfast crew was phenomenal and we looked forward to the fresh fruit, fresh squeezed orange juice, local pastries, and meats and cheeses every morning. Eggs were made to order and were an added treat. The location was just a few steps away from everything in Porto, yet on a quiet street where we felt like we were at our own peaceful retreat. We stayed in the 2nd floor garden room and loved the full glass wall/door that we could open to the patio and hear the birds and see the beautiful green trees and garden. The room was super high tech, we LOVED the decor, and the cleanliness was second to none. We also appreciated the rain shower... Felt like we were at a fancy spa.We loved the â€œmagic machineâ€ where we could scan our QR code for local wines. One afternoon, we brought our books downstairs to the kitchen, poured a glass of wine, and ordered some tapas off their afternoon tapas menu (olives and sardine pate). We recommend building in a relaxation day while here to read a book and truly enjoy the accommodations - we are so glad we did!For those looking to enjoy a relaxing retreat that is close to everything in Porto, we cannot recommend this place enough. It was a true highlight of our honeymoon!",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,5

Along the walk there were numerous little mom and pop cafes where you get a coffee and pastry for cheap and there was metro access close by too. There were also a few supermarkets close by. I cant comment on the breakfasts because I didnt attend any even though they were included. I left very early on my check out day and a taxi to the airport was just under 10 euros and about 15 minutes. Reception was helpful.

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Banoyi,13,Banoyiwrote a review Sep 2012,"We went from The Oitavos in Cascais to Altis Belem in Lisbon. It took some adjustment.From the country to the city. From a large hotel to a design hotel. The exterior of the hotel â€“ modern architecture â€“ was exciting. The interior matched that. The hotel is situated on the banks of Tejo, so the view is beautiful.The receptionist at the hotel was extremely welcoming. Unfortunately the â€“ as they advertise - â€˜exclusive gourmet restaurant specialising in signature dishesâ€™ Feitoria was closed for the holiday. That was a big disappointment. But the sushi chef at the other restaurant almost made up for that. The menu was very nice. Breakfast was lovely.The modern design rooms were comfortable and offered a wonderful view on the river. Amazing to experience the wonders of nature when from one moment to another the view was blogged by a fog, which disappeared as quick as it appeared.Three of us visited the Bspa. I was enthusiastic about Magda who gave me a manicure and a pedicure. Magda has devine hands. My husband had a massage and my daughter a facial programme. Both of them were not impressed. They rated it as â€˜okâ€™. Important to say that my husband compared it to his massage 2 days earlier at the Oitavos, which was â€œof a different classâ€. It is hard to beat that. What I personally did not like at the Bspa was the pushiness of the staff to sell Karin Herzog products. When I came in, they were ambushing a guest. When I finished there was the ambush again. I donâ€™t feel this type of behaviour, hard sell, suites a 5-star hotel. I blame management, because I figure that the pushiness comes from the reward system implemented by management. If you put a target on sales of the products, then you can expect pushiness from the staff. Furthermore they mixed up our reservation; they booked it for the wrong day.All in all a very nice hotel.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,3

Our suite was spacious, with separate living space and bedroom.The kitchenette was surprisingly well equiped and it was quite possible to prepare evening meals.

There is a large new Pingo Doce just round the corner for supplies.Take plenty of change for the parking meter. Its only 10 euros a day but only accepts coins.The breakfasts are good, and there is a bar and complementary coffee and cake for tea - a nice touch.We didn't try the pool as early February, but the gardens are well-kept and colourful, even in February.It's worth visiting the Paula Rego Museum, which is close by.

Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,Janmalf,13,Janmalfwrote a review Oct 2021,Property is well kept and nice friendly owners but no air conditioning which is a problem when hot at night if on ground floor as when windows are open the apartments are not secure.  Easy for someone to walk into the garden and then into a ground floor apartment.  If apartment windows are closed can be extremely uncomfortable at night.  If good security is a priority consider carefully as this property may not suit you.  You can pay more for an upper floor if available which would resolve the security problem but it would still be very hot at night.  You also have to pay an extra 10 Euros a week for the safe.  The beach is expensive 2 sunchairs and an umbrella are 30 Euros a day.,Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,3

The food in the hotel is very limited and average, very high prices for what you actually get.We found the beds very hard and generally didn’t feel that it was the luxury the hotel advertises.On a positive note the staff were absolutely wonderful and this made the stay more pleasurable.",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,2
