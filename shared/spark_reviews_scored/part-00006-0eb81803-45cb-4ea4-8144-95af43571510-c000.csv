Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Henrik M,0,Henrik Mwrote a review Aug 2023,"High price, Bad service!Apartment is nice, however they have trouble to clean. They blame it on the sign that on one side says please tidy our room can have moved to the other side.The personnel in reception, spa reception are rude and not service minded. Maybe the hotel does not pay then properly.Had much better experience in NAU Rafael Atlântico in Albufeira. For this price I would not recommend this hotel",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,2
Saccharum,sheena234,1,sheena234wrote a review Apr 2016,"Our visit to Madeira was made complete by the excellent stay at the Saccharum. It's a very clean, friendly and quiet hotel. Rooms were of a very high standard. Breakfast could not have been more varied, something for everyone. The buffet evening meal was also good value. Very nice restaurants near by, p,entry to do.The taxi service we used was Gregory and Ernesto De Sousa who offered cheaper trips than those organised elsewhere. We were a party of four so so splitting the cost made it more economical. A fantastic holiday. April 2016",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Betzy540,3,Betzy540wrote a review May 2022,"Plus points:Overall service - excellent. Staff are so attentive and kind. From hospitality to housekeeping, everything was taken care of.Cleanliness - superb. The pools, common areas, rooms and all eating areas were spotless and regularly cleaned and sanitised.Kids club - wow - fantastic activities and brilliant interaction. We were a bit worried about our little girl attending as it’s our first holiday with her at an age to use one, but the real we’re just brilliant.She loved every moment when she went and Viva, Mar and the team made her so welcome.We could see her and check on her whenever we wanted. She only went a handful of times for an hour or so but she says it’s what she will miss the most.Food - great. I had read about the food being quite repetitive which some of it is, but there is so much choice that we didn’t eat the same meal twice.All good was so well presented and very tasty. The themed evenings in the restaurant were great with a real authentic feel.Rooms - beautiful. The decor is clean and modern. Beds are comfortable and views are spectacular. The room we had was spacious and had plenty of wardrobe space for three of us.The shower is great and the hotel provided shampoo and conditioner is above expected standard.Small touches make such a difference such as the fridge, and large fresh bottle of water being left every day by the cleaning staff.Also there’s a Velcro strip on the wall to ensure the black out curtain doesn’t move in the night - small detail but something we found really useful.Pools - apart from the temperatures the pools were brilliant. The kids splash zone was lots of fun and the bigger slides were brilliant and really made the hotel stand out as a great fun family attraction.Location - very convenient - walking distance to bars, restaurants and shops.The hotel also has a free shuttle bus to the beach which is fantastic.Old Town is 10 mins in a taxi we used Uber which was really good.The hotel is definitely one for families. The staff are an absolute credit to the brand.It would be five stars if it weren’t for two things:The swimming pools are really cold, I had to take my little one out a few times as her lips were turning blue - however she still loved it and had so much fun Ain the water.Second negative is the meal times when we checked in we were told there was only an 8.30pm slot for dinner for our first two nights. We found this disappointing as that’s far too late for our toddler to eat. This meant we had to go an eat outside of the hotel these nights and we’re unable to use the all inclusive meals we had paid for.Overall it was an amazing family holiday. Loved it and would fully recommend to people with you d children.Thank you to the whole team for your hospitality.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,H0lidayMaker,38,H0lidayMakerwrote a review Aug 2023,"Have done many AI over the years including a few in different resorts in Portugal.This is the biggest complex we’ve stayed at, probably over 500 rooms so it is busy, there are lots of kids, but even then you can still have a relaxing holiday if desired.The hotel is listed as 5 star but certain elements let it down.The plus points,quiet pool is very nice and chilled with beds available to rent for €25 per day. We found the applying of the no floaty / ball games rule applied inconsistently. We saw 2 small kids told off for playing with a very small ball one day, and then on another day teenagers jumping in with inflatables and throwing a rugby ball from one side to the other often hitting other guests. The rule needs to be applied all the time if it’s in place.The food is up there with the best. Not quite sure what people have to moan about there is a great variety and ques are not bad at all. We did witness some adults eating their meals from the kids buffet so perhaps that explains the type of person who’d complain about the food choices.The 2 supplementary resteraunts were also excellent and did give it that 5 star feel.Staff were excellent. Nietto in particular but the whole entertainment team work non stop. All bar staff friendly and the reception team sorted out any issues we had swiftly.Roof top bar was nice and had a good feel to it too.The lifts were actually fine and simple. 3 simple steps are shown on the walls yet it seems some people still can’t follow simple instructions. It’s like standing at a train station waiting for a train to Leeds and getting on one going to London as it’s the next one that shows up. Lifts are fine it’s the users that are the issue.The negatives,Rooms are ok but we only had one small pull out bed for 2 kids to share. We raised this with reception who swiftly added another. Not sure if this was an oversight or they genuinely expected a girl and boy to share a tiny sofa bed for 11 nights? There isn’t a double just 2 very uncomfortable singles pushed together.For a 5 star hotel there is far too much noise. Admittedly not solely the fault of the hotel but there was constant banging from above, doors being slammed and people talking loudly in the corridors. Just unnecessary in a 5 star complex but would expect better soundproofing.No mini bar option at all, just a solitary bottle of water. Towels folded rather than changed, same for bedding and just general signs of wear and tear in the room / bathroom that let things down and gave the feel of a 3 / 4 star hotel not 5.Sunbeds is obviously an issue. But again the main fault lies with the human race and lack of respect for others. We only had a couple of “pool days” and could manage to find a couple of beds at 9ish but most were reserved and often not used until the afternoon. You would expect this at a 3star hotel in Turkey, but for a 5star hotel I’d expect a better system in place to prevent this behaviour but ultimately it is the selfish behaviour of others that needs addressing.There were also many people smoking and vaping poolside which isn’t acceptable in this day and age.The drinks are not great. All cocktails come from a dispenser machine and are 95% sugar mixed with god knows what. Certainly not branded spirits all drinks are cheaper versions of the main branded drinks. Again not acceptable for 5 star hotel.We didn’t use the shuttle bus as it’s so cheap and easy to get an Uber or walk.All in all we had a great stay, would probably come back here although after 5/6 days it becomes a bit repetitive even more so I’d imagine if you don’t leave the complex at all",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,3

Villas Barrocal,Tired of B,44,Tired of Bwrote a review Sep 2015,"Travelled with husband, daughter (8) and son (6).  We booked a one bedroom apartment as the seating area had other sleeping facilities, as a family of four that was a mistake as the other sleeping facilities were a small double bed in the sitting area of the living room.   My daughter not being daft suggested that my husband and I sleep in that bed as its the only area for viewing TV when you came in after a meal out!  I did hear that other residents had an upgrade to a two bedroom apartment.  Good on the hotel, we got what we paid for.  Well equipped apartments with everything you need (other than a bigger bed!!). We hired a car which I would recommend.  The villas are fabulously located for waterparks but you still need a form of transport to get there, other families were using taxis (10 €).   The local amenities within Pera are very limited, we drove out to America de Pera most nights for meals.  If you would like a reasonable family holiday, Villas Barrocal are great, book two rooms for a family of 4 and hire a car.  You'll have a good time!",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,house O,20,house Owrote a review Jul 2022,"We had heard wonderful things of this great hotel so decided to give it a go as our first family holiday and only 1 child she was bound to make friends also.As our arrival was late and most restaurants closed, reception had a lovely welcom pack of snacks awaiting for us...a few sandwiches, sweet cake and some fruit which I regarded as a really lovely touch.Our room was on the 10th floor which was fine so we got to our room and unpacked. We got a night cap from the wonderful Maria in the rooftop bar...a complete lady. Sn we went to bed. Next morning we awoke an went out onto our small balcony to check out the view, the floor on the balcony had not seen a mop in some time nor had the sliding doors onto same as they were covered in bird droppings some of which had been there for some time!! Kind of disappointing but moved on to the pool. The baby pools didn't appear to be cleaned overly often either and as the week went on there would be like plasters etc in da pool and wud be for a number of days...big pool not to bad tho.  Indoor pool fantastic but not included on the all inclusive.Fantastic selection of food but quality of food was poor, all food very rubbery and bland with the exception of fruit. We discovered an Irish bar across the road on the last 2 days (Erin's Isle) fab food and staffAnimation & kids club fantasticI found the hotel dirty. Dust still on skirting boards since whenever it was renovated and even still some masking tape on parts of skirting boards as you go up the stairs also.The few times our room eas cleaned, the empty tins/cups not taken away, sink in ensuite not cleaned n da floor on da balcony never touched n rug in the room not hoovered.All in all very sub standard for a supposid 5 star hotel. Sadly I can't say we will be returning anytime soon.  Also just to note if you book directly with the hotel or via booking.com you get your mini bar refilled everyday free of charge however if you use a travel agent to book your holiday here you are not afforded this luxury!!",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,2

Lisbon Destination Hostel,lindacav,30,lindacavwrote a review Mar 2019,"I just got back from my 5 night stay at Lisbon Destination Hostel. I'm quite happy I ended up staying here with my partner for our first proper holiday together.THE HOSTELThey have improved insulation and we could barely hear anything happening in the common room.Do not be put off by the hostel being inside a train station - you won't hear any train announcements or train related noises (only a slight vibration to be perceived now and then, but nothing too bad).The common room is an open space, filled with all sorts of plants, which I personally loved. There is a pool table, sofas, hammocks and a computer for you to use.THE ROOMWe booked a double room with ensuite bathroom. Our first room had major issues with the bathroom door which wouldn't close at all. Hats up to the staff that promptly assisted us and secured us another room for the remainder of our stay. The new room was okay, however the shower tended to be a bit moody at times, going from stone cold to burning hot water every 5 seconds.Having said that, the rooms in themselves are nice and quite simple and there is a fan which cools down the room. All in all we felt a bit like the whole environment needs fixing here and there.STAFFProbably the best feature of this place. Warmest welcome by Daniela, Sonia and Ellen, who provided friendly service all along, making us feel happy to be there. Pedro, Debora and Jade deserve mentions in this as well - they all did perform great customer service.I would say staff is generally friendly, some maybe a bit less than others for whatever reason (we never got asked how our stay was - or anything else - upon check-out by receptionist on duty).TOURSThe hostel offers an array of tours, ranging from fado tours, city tours to pub crawls. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them, really! We went to the bbq at the sister hostel, followed by the pub crawl. We did enjoy, however the pub crawl could have perhaps been better with a smaller group. Manuel did an absolutely great job managing 30+ people that night, kudos!Manuel deserves another mention for taking us to and showing us around Sintra - and what a great tour it was! We loved every minute. He was funny, knowledgeable, patient and able to answer all sorts of questions.Finally, I would highly recommend anyone to stay at Lisbon Destination Hostel - Location is perfect, the interiors are great, breakfast is included and staff makes you feel welcome.Well done!Muito obrigados,Linda & Daan",Mar,2019,Mar 2019,2019-03-01,2019,4
1e Carvoeiro,Jenny W,461,Jenny Wwrote a review Nov 2016,"We picked up a hire car from Faro and drove to this resort.  On checking in we were given an information pack on the resort by a pleasant man in reception.  We were allocated a two bed apartment (54) in the  area knows at Restaurant Square - this is a central plaza area with a fountain - in need of updating as it is quite scruffy in parts. The apartment has recently been refurbished to a good standard and was spacious.  However, it was directly above the Cocktail Garden bar which was a disappointment to us.  However, although the noise could be heard in the double bedroom it did not keep us awake at night.  There was also a restaurant visible from the balcony, again this did not stop our enjoyment of the apartment, although on one occasion there was a singer on that was noisy but the music was good, so no problem. The apartment comprised of a lounge, kitchen, two bedrooms (one with twin beds/one with double, hallway, large bathroom, plus one smaller shower room (good showers with hot water at all times).  Very well equipped with air-conditioning, wifi (slow at times - not good enough for downloading), washing machine, fridge, freezer and plenty of cutlery, crockery, glassware, pots and pans etc.  Plenty of English TV channels to choose from. Two balconies - one at the back with two sun-beds and table/chairs and one at the front that could be used if required.  Pool towels were provided from reception (foc for CLC members), as was the safe. We did not attend the welcome meeting but did go to the wine tasting evening hosted by Shaun and Billy, who were very friendly, pleasant and helpful.  Small pool area with sunbeds and a pool bar. Easy parking outside.  The resort is comprised of 1 bed and 2 bed apartment in a pleasant traditional Portugese style.  Some areas of the resort are in urgent need of freshening up, mainly in the outside areas - new tiling to walkways/terraces. Maid service was a couple of times a week with mid-week linen/towel change.The resort is about 15-20 minutes walk into Carvoeiro downhill - cut through the square and it is an easy walk.  A good choice of restaurants and shops to choose from to suit all tastes.  We loved the boardwalk area and walked along to the light-house - scenery stunning and not to be missed - excellent beach bar (Boneca on route). Small beach with sun-beds.  Three places definitely worth a visit are Silves (castle)  and Ferragudo (fishing village), plus Alvor.The nearest supermarket is in Carvoeiro town and is small, but adequate.  Larger supermarkets are located in Lagoa (Aldi, Apollonia plus others).  It is not far if you have a car.We have already booked to go again with Club la Costa, as we enjoyed our stay so much.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,3

Casa Mitchell Apartments,MarieCheshire,38,MarieCheshirewrote a review Sep 2022,"After a very stressful time getting through the chaos of Manchester Airport, we sailed through Faro Airport.  Arrived at Casa Mitchell an hour later.  Our apartment was on the ground floor over looking the pool area;  Very pleased with the apartment, very traditional, clean and spacious with everything you need if you decide to cook. Iron and iron board  too.  No hair dryer which would have been useful. Plenty of small bars/cafes nearby and very cheap.  Old Town lovely with beach and marina, but if you go to the Square to eat, the prices are double, so worth going off the Square. We got on the Hop on Hop off bus to see rest of Albufeira but got very bored.  Albufeira  totally hotels and apartments.  We would definitely recommend the Casa Mitchell.  The only two issues were the bath towels were very very thin so difficult to dry yourself fully after a shower. The sunbed beds are lovely but not very comfortable if on them for awhile, however, it was only halfway through our holiday that we discovered there were very thick comfortable beds to put on the rattan sun beds, and they were amazing. We found them in the bottom of the wardrobe hidden under extra pillows. We would recommend Casa Mitchell and the Old Town.  Finally the local people were lovely and friendly",Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,4
Casa Mitchell Apartments,Lindsay029,8,Lindsay029wrote a review Oct 2009,Have just returned from 2 weeks holiday at the Casa Mitchell Apartments.  Can't praise this place highly enough.  We had a studio apartment overlooking the pool which was adequate for the 2 of us.  All the apartments overlook the pool and delightful gardens.  The apartments were spotlessly clean.  Maid service every day except Mondays and the staff were friendly and could not do enough for you.Because there are only 14 apartments the pool is never crowded.  The pool area gets the sun at all times of the day.  Just a few minutes down the road and you are on the beach and another few minutes walk from there into the old town where there are countless excellent restaurants and bars.This place is a hidden gem and would definately return there.  Can't remember when I had such a relaxing holiday.,Oct,2009,Oct 2009,2009-10-01,2009,1
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,PDPatara,64,PDPatarawrote a review Jan 2016,"Stayed in November with family and had two rooms on a high floor.   The rooms were very clean & comfortable and the hotel gives a superior feel, the staff were probably the most helpful and attentive I've ever encountered.  We had breakfast which was not included in our deal, at 15euro a bit pricey but the food was excellent and plentiful and was well worth it.  There is a pool which looked nice but not one for November!The downside is the location, its 10-15euro in a taxi to the centre of Lisbon and beside a motorway so theres no walking anywhere.   There was slight road noise (from really noisy cars or bikes) but not so bad we didnt sleep.I would certainly stay here again.",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,4
Luna Clube Oceano,majellica,29,majellicawrote a review Jun 2017,"Just back from a lovely holiday in Albufeira!  We enjoyed our stay here.  The pool is good for kids (baby pool and shallow end of the adult pool), the pool area is really chilled so nice for young families or people wanting to relax.  We always found it easy to get a lounger, which is great because we're not early risers!  The pool was a little dirty the first week as the water was low and the wasn't reaching the filters but once we told the staff at reception it was topped up straight away and was lovely and clean for the rest of the trip.The staff at reception and the ladies who clean the rooms were really friendly and helpful.  The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels when needed, the kitchen had all the basic things you would expect from a holiday apartment.  I think the apartments are bigger than average.  They are also lovely and quiet, and even though the bedrooms are on the corridor we were never disturbed by any noise.As for the restaurant/pool bar - avoid at all costs.  Although the decor is lovely, the staff are unfriendly (complete contrast to reception staff) and there is no atmosphere.  We ate lunch there once, it took nearly half an hour to make a tuna salad even though there was only one other family there.  When it arrived it wasn't great.   After buying icepops there  a few timed we found they were much more expensive than the shop across the road so went there in future.The incident which really disappointed us happened on the last day, and really left us with a bad impression of the hotel.  My four year old wanted to go to the bar to buy Pringles - she loved sitting on the swinging bar stools! We agreed as it was the last day even though we knew it wasn't great value! We went up to the bar and she asked for a Pringles, they were €2.  My daughter handed over her money and was 2 cent short (probably dropped on the way up).  We had just come from the pool so had no more money with us.  The lady at the bar took the pringles back and said she couldn't have them.  I asked her \"Are you seriously not letting a four year old have Pringles because she is 2c short?\", waved her hand and said \"the manager\" and walked away leaving me embarrassed and my daughter near tears.  We went to the minimarket across the road where they cost €1.20, the man there was lovely and gave her a free lolly! Such a difference in cost and service.I would recommend if you are staying here go to the Minimarket just across the road past the pubs for crisps and ice creams, and for food, Restaurant San Joao next door does lovely food with really nice staff (most people from the hotel seemed to eat lunch here).If management from the hotel are reading this review, I don't know if the restaurant is run by a separate company or your own staff, but it was the worst part of our stay with you and it's such a pity it isn't better given the quality, value and service in most of the local restaurants.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Kate70,220,Kate70wrote a review Mar 2015,"This is a really good hotel and good value.It is close to the airport and also to the town centre - both trips  cost about 10 euros and take about 10 mins  to get to by taxi. The nearest metro is a pain to find/get back from- not handy.It is also not in a picturesque area but has other advantages..You notice how good the staff are from the moment you drive up- they are very friendly and helpful. Equally- awesome staff in the exec lounge which is a good size, good food selection, a computer, a terrace.The breakfast is excellent- a good choice and kept warm and stocked up.It looks like rooms have been recently furbished and whilst average sized are modern and comfortable- and have a balcony! Bathrooms are good.The reception is being renovated currently but not an issue.There is a pool outside and terrace around it. and it looks like a café/bar area outside when the season starts- albeit like summer already.Compared with its sister hotel, the Autograph in the centre, this wins easily for me.. and I would come back again!",Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,4
PortoBay Liberdade,tomtom9,68,tomtom9wrote a review Sep 2015,"The hotel definitely lived up to its marketing ads and tripadvisor reviews as one of the nicest, well priced hotels in the heart of Lisbon city center.  It is only 2 minutes from Lisbon's main avenue which takes you to most of the sites around the city center.  Included on this main boulevard are high end designer shops, restaurants of all price ranges, and many tourists.  The rooms at this hotel were very nicely furnished, brand new and well priced.  Many of the surrounding hotels like Sofitel are older and right on the main boulevard. We enjoyed being slightly away from the busy crowds.  We enjoyed a free breakfast buffet with our room rate in their lovely restaurant.  Other than the restaurant and a small bar in the lobby, there were not too many other amenities.But, there was an outstanding indoor pool and health center. The hotel amenities, friendly staff service, and ambiance was just right.  Location was great for walking as this is a walking city.

Four Seasons Fairways,jual13,23,jual13wrote a review Nov 2012,"This is our fifth visit to Four Seasons Fairways. Yet again, we had a lovely stay and had a very relaxing time. The staff are wonderful and welcoming, and work very hard to make everyones holiday an enjoyable one. From the lifeguards, to the ladies and gentlemen in the restaurant, and the reception staff - nothing is too much trouble. And inspite of having a lot of visitors throughout the year, they remember you, often referring to things from previous visits!The Villas are very well furnished and equipped, and soooo clean!! The pools/jacuzzis, bbqs garden etc. furniture make it a thoroughly enjoyable stay.The weather was not that good on this occasion but we played tennis, snooker, swam in the indoor pool and went in the gym and sauna. We had lovely meals in the restaurant in the clubhouse, and also took advantage of the takeaway service, for the evenings we stayed in the villa.We have been members for 5 years, visiting for 1 week per year.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,polskipilot,27,polskipilotwrote a review Nov 2018,"One of my favourite hotels to stay at. Large property, close to the subway station near the zoo and little restaurants nearby. All personnel are very kind and quick with any requests. There is even a large courtyard type area with kids play toys if you have kids along (which I have had a few times). Rooms are relatively small and a few times I've had issues with cooling the room off but those issues were resolved after maintenance tinkered around with something.",Nov,2018,Nov 2018,2018-11-01,2018,5

Williams was closed but we were offered a Champagne buffet instead, not being a fan of buffet dining I was sceptical, no need you did not even have to carry your plate back to the table. Every detail was looked after. The food was amongst the best I have ever had, perfectly cooked scallops, smoked salmon to die for ( I am Scottish so am used to great salmon) fantastic beef scabbard fish. This kind of cooking leaves the chefs no place to hide, all the sauces were separate so no room for error and there was none. Can't recommend highly enough.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,2

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Ron S,8,Ron Swrote a review Jun 2017,"My partner (now wife) and I stayed at the Tivoli Carvoeiro from Monday 29th May 2017 to Monday 12th June 2017 and we chose the hotel for our wedding. Please find below our comments/complaints regarding our stayHotelThe first impressions of the hotel were very good with very friendly door staff, cleanliness and breathtaking views over the Atlantic ocean from the 5th floor bar balcony. We arrived there around 13:00, only to be told that our room wasn't ready and to leave our luggage and  come back between 14:00-15:00. This wasn't an issue, as we were told on the coach journey that the normal check in for Portugal hotels was later than normal. However, we were allocated a (nice) room on the third floor of the hotel that had twin beds. We were there to get married so this should ideally have been arranged as a double room. Also, we were asked to register to the hotel's (I assume it's the Tivoli group?) Discovery program, which entitled us to free bottles of water (this never appeared and we were later told it was only one bottle upon check in) a free daily newspaper and future benefits. I'm still waiting for the e-mail confirmation of my username and password, almost three weeks later. Also, the water/newspaper situation was never fully explained to us. One of the biggest problems was that the hotel wasn't finished and we were only told this when we checked in. We couldn't therefore use the spa, indoor pool or gym, which was one of the reasons we booked this hotel. My wife was very disappointed that these features weren't available, as she wanted to use the gym and have several beauty treatments prior to our wedding. Towards the end of our stay a marquee had been erected where customers could have massages but this wasn't really acceptable, not when it's in full view of every room on the side of the hotelRoomsOur room, which was 209 after being moved from the twin room, was very nice, clean and airy with modern furnishings and a large balcony overlooking well maintained gardens and a child's play area with a nice view of the ocean to our right. The air conditioning was very poor, even when set to the lowest setting and left running all day. There was no large mirror in the room and this was something my wife requested, as she needed this when getting ready for our wedding. We asked for one to be installed and to be fair, it was after three days of persistence from ourselves. There were smaller mirrors above the bedside tables but these were pointless, as they were obscured by lamps. The mirror in the bathroom was large but there was no working extraction so this quickly became steamed up after showering. It seems as though it's the hotel's policy to \"turn down\" the rooms in an evening and while this wouldn't normally be a problem, we had to ask reception, no fewer than three times, not to do this, as the key was taken out of the slot (for the electricity) twice and the door was left open once. One thing we also noticed is that there were no fire evacuation notices in the room so we had no idea what to do in the event of a fire. Surely this should be in every hotel in the world, regardless of star rating. There's no kettle in the room, just a coffee machine that would've been fine except that the individual coffee pots were 2 euros each and the cups were so tiny it'd be pointless. We'd have also liked an ironing board (we brought our own travel iron) in a supposedly five star hotel tooBreakfastBreakfast, on the whole, was average with a large selection of the usual fare; cold meats and cheeses, bread, fruit, smoothies, yoghurt, cereal. There was also a cooked breakfast selection, which was the same every day and although this isn't a problem, the food was lukewarm at best. Waiter service at the table, for hot drinks like tea, coffee and hot chocolate was a bit hit and miss and we didn't always get what we asked for when we asked for itPoolThe pool was a decent size but we didn't ever see it being cleaned of an evening. Quite often there was a scummy and filthy residue collecting in the corners of the pool and we complained about this several times. The response was that it was sun-tan lotion and people should shower before they enter. However, the hotel was sparsely populated so I'd hate to think what it would be like in the peak holiday months of July and August. Sunbeds were plentiful, again due to low occupancy and easy to obtainStaffThe pool bar staff and housekeeping staff were fantastic and nothing was ever too much trouble for them. The bar staff in the Ocean view bar and Sky bar were also good. However, the reception staff were largely clueless as to our requirements and not very forthcoming with information. For instance, we asked for the room \"turn down\" service to be cancelled, as it wasn't something we required and although we were told this had been entered onto their computer it took another two verbal requests to the front desk and another complaint to Mariela for it to be cancelled. We decided it'd be easier to simply leave the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, as the staff were meticulous in observing this. We were checking the Jet2 website for prices, as the price difference to upgrade from bed & breakfast to half board was just £4. However, we were quoted 42 euros per person, per night to upgrade! I also had to ask the reception staff what time we would be picked up to return to the airport (since it wasn't posted anywhere or given to us) and they simply didn't know and had to contact the Tivoli head officeWeddingWe booked our wedding at the hotel for Tuesday 6th June 2017 and although the day itself was superb, there were quite a few issues leading up to, on the day itself and afterwards that marred our experience at the Tivoli. The first one, mentioned above, was the lack of spa/gym facilities at the hotel. Also mentioned above was the other issue of the hotel being unfinished. We, along with all our guests, were expected to either walk through an unfinished corridor (with electrical cables hanging loose, ceiling tiles missing) and then through an unfinished bedroom or what can only be described as a building site to the hotel's cliff-side wedding location. We made a request for the area to be cleaned and tidied to at least make it presentable and it was almost like we'd asked for 100,000 euros! To be fair, they did turf the walkway, which was better but how can they possibly host weddings when the hotel is in that condition. The wedding venue was dressed very nicely along with the chairs and tables for the wedding breakfast but they made us have the evening reception downstairs in another room, which resembled your average working men's club. It was simply a large, very dusty room with plain tables and chairs, a temporary bar area and a dance floor with a DJ stage. We asked if this room could have been dressed to look like a wedding room and Mariela's response was \"no\". She did later state that some of the table dressings would be taken from the meal area and moved but this wasn't done. There was a dedicated function room on the fifth floor where other weddings were held but they stated that we couldn't use this with a DJ due to noise complaints for other hotel guests but shortly after we were told this, we noticed the room was dressed for a wedding with a live band in the evening. Very disappointing. The wedding ceremony itself was fantastic and everyone commented on the setting and quality of the service from the celebrant (Leonard Beard). The waiter service at the meal (wedding breakfast) was poor and very, very slow. A waiter came out from the bar area carrying an overloaded tray of full champagne flutes, which he subsequently spilt. This is something that can be expected but when he did it a second time, this time all over some of our guests, including a young baby it was inexcusable. What made it worse was that he didn't apologise and simply walked away, clearly embarrassed with himself. Also, as part of our wedding we performed a sand ceremony where the celebrant half filled a bottle with beach sand and then my wife and I filled up with two different coloured sands to fill the bottle and it was then something we could take home with us as a special memento from the day. We asked the wedding coordinator (Marissa) to have the bottle brought to the table, which it was. However, the following day we approached the reception desk to ask where it was and we were told (by Catarina) that it was in reception but it would be brought up to our room. She claimed that it was but they didn't knock on the door, as the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was there so she went back down to reception and attempted to contact us by telephone. The phone rang three times and each time we answered, the line went dead. We asked again the next day and we were just pushed from one member of staff to another who each gave us no idea where our bottle was. Later that afternoon we had a meeting with Mariela who then told us that the bottle had been locked on lost property but they couldn't find the key. She then had the audacity to say, \"well you're not leaving until Monday so we'll get it to you by the weekend\". This led us to believe that they didn't have the bottle and we were annoyed that they could insult our intelligence in this way. On Friday morning I received an e-mail from the celebrant (I still have these e-mails to corroborate this), stating that the hotel had explained the situation with the bottle and that he'd prepared another one for us but it was a three hour round trip and could we meet him at the airport. At this point we knew we'd been lied to so I told him what had occurred so he replied saying that there'd been a miscommunication and that the bottle had been found. It was given to my mother-in-law, as we'd lost all faith in the hotel's management by this time and all we wanted to do was leave the hotel and go home. When we saw the bottle, we could've cried, as it clearly wasn't the one we'd made on the day (I have photos of the two bottles to prove this). This left us both very upset and we couldn't understand how staff at a supposedly five star hotel could lie to us like this. We spent two weeks there and around £11,000 to get married there and not once were we made to feel special in any way. Even the room upgrade was pointless and didn't deliver what was promised. We were told there'd be sparking wine, flowers, fruit and mineral water in the room but the latter of these were absent. Also, the room upgrade was hardly an upgrade at all and wasn't any different from our own room, which we went straight back to. Surely a five star hotel should have some sort of bridal suite? To top it all off, my stepson's portable speaker was stolen from the reception room downstairs. We asked at the font desk, asked the DJ and asked Mariela if it had been handed in, only to be told it hadn't. She had the audacity to suggest that one of the wedding party may have taken it but we know that they hadn't. We asked if one of the members of staff had taken it but we were told that they were all security checked. However, I have proof on social media of an item being stolen and given to someone (not a guest, as the person wasn't staying there) in the hotel. At no point are we saying that this happened but someone has taken it and I've had to purchase another one at a cost of £160OverallThe hotel has a long way to go before it can be worthy of a five star rating and the only selling point we and others could see are the amazing views. It's staggeringly overpriced for bed and breakfast and the level of service are very poor. The hotel needs to be fully finished and the staff have to be brought up to speed to get it to five star. I've stayed in three star hotels in developing countries where the customer service levels far outweigh the Tivoli. Not once, other than the wedding day, which was largely due to our friends and family, did we feel made like it was a special occasion and we've seen SO many similar complaints on the Trip Advisor website, which all receive the same, standard reply from the manager, which may as well just be a copy and paste exercise. We're considering raising these points with a professional holiday complaints company, as we doubt anyone at the Tivoli will take this seriously",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,2

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,FideliaKF,1,FideliaKFwrote a review Oct 2016,"I have a room on the first floor. The balcony was clean and pleasant for me to enjoy the beautiful setting of this hotel. However, the room decor is dated and while seemingly clean, there is a musty smell and the bed cover does look old and unpleasant. The table lamp on the desk doesn't not work, thus the room is dark. We stayed for two nights and both nights the hot water came out brown. When I mentioned it to my tour director she just dismissed it as the result of your hotel renovation. The front desk staff was not friendly. They are not rude but not welcoming (made we feel that I am bothering them with my question of directions and wifi). On the first day I left a thermos at the 4th floor breakfast restaurant. When I inquired about it in the afternoon, none was found. I asked the staff to inquire but no result. I finally asked my tour director to inquire again Andy it was found right after. As the result, my tour director was not too happy with me that I was forgetful! If your staff had dealt with this matter promptly I would not need to receive an unpleasant remark from my tour director (she should not make any remarks anyway).

Hotel Gat Rossio,_fil-Travel,3,_fil-Travelwrote a review Nov 2010,"This hotel has been quite simply a surprise from start to finish. It is located in a central spot in Lisbon, very easy to reach by public transport and very well connected with the rest of the city and surrounding areas.The main thing one is hit by is the stark, modern design all based on a green-white-black pattern. The reception is tiny but immaculate and very functional and the route to reach the rooms [whether by elevator or using the stairs] is a continous discovery of cleverly designed spaces.The room was great. All white, with a wonderful system to hang your clothes, stock empty suitcases and integrating a safe. The bathroom [which featured one of the most powerful showers we've ever had] sported black walls and a lime-green shower cubicle.Every morning we were treated to a gigantic breakfast buffet ranging from typical Lisbon sweets  to more traditional continental breakfast items.The staff has always been very friendly, helpful and professional.Definitely reccomended!",Nov,2010,Nov 2010,2010-11-01,2010,5

They've got a lovely swimming pool and a kids pool which at the peak of heat was packed with families. Plenty of sun loungers and though some were waking up early to reserve loungers, the hotel don't let you do this before 8pm. Plenty of towels available and they've got pool attendants for when you want a drink or snack by the pool. The menu is limited and food is expensive (this is a 5 star hotel hotel and at time of writing the GBP is weak against the Euro). We had a few bits of confusion around dinner and splitting bills and sometimes others in our party had some requirements for the children which were either ignored or not accommodated but for us (without children) it was a perfectly good hotel. It gets very busy but it's close to the beach so you can always go to the sea I'd the pool is too crowded and there's plenty of places to sit in the shade there. Overall a good experience let down by a few small details. But definitely one of the best hotels in the area.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4

Room in A block was large with a big balcony with Sea and Pool views (room 706). Plenty big enough for two adults and two teens although not the most modern and some areas were in need of decoration. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room had air con, large bedroom large lounge and balcony with 2 sunbeds and a table for four.Breakfast was busy but a really good choice and good quality of food.Cons: Pool was really busy and sunbeds were all \"reserved\" by 0800 in the morning. There were not nearly enough sunbeds for the number of guests staying and the pool got really busy by lunchtime with a number of ball games and inflatables taking up what little space there was. The hotel had an inconsistent application of their no sunbed reservation policy. Wherever your room is, there will be steps - sometimes a lot of steps- they didn't bother us but will really put off some people. We had lunch in the buffet once and where breakfast was great, lunch was really poor and we only ate there once.Overall, I would stay here again and we didn't have any trouble with same sex parties as had been mentioned earlier, but the hotel is in need of renovation and updating.

There are quite a few restaurants and bars around the apartments but as I said we preferred the old town which had more to offer and was a little more Portuguese. We found the area of the apartments was very British and they certainly catered for British tastes.Overall though a very good holiday and I would definitely recommend the Natura to anyone who wants the best of both worlds, relaxing during the day and going out at night.",Oct,2009,Oct 2009,2009-10-01,2009,4

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Barnfield,3,Barnfieldwrote a review Apr 2012,"Very clean,welcoming and efficiently run. highly recommended but only have Bed & BreakfastThis then allows you to visit some splendid local restaurants, do not miss the Three Palmtrees near the big shopping development on the fringe of town over the new bridge.Dinner is typically buffet with all except main courses OK but yet again I found the main courses poor, either colder than they should be or well stewed. Vegetables were alwaqys overcooked and often tinned",Apr,2012,Apr 2012,2012-04-01,2012,4
Varzinn Hotel,imarijan,8,imarijanwrote a review Jul 2024,"I pulled off a star because of the location.

Yes! Lisbon Hostel,Florian Chour,0,Florian Chourwrote a review Jan 2019,"A massive obrigado to the entire Yes Lisbon hostel team !! We arrived from France with my friend with no idea of what Lisbon could offer us. As soon as we walked into the hostel, Iâ€™ve been hit in the face by the positive vibes that was in the atmosphere. I donâ€™t know what I should talk about first as the experience was extremely satisfying helped by all the spots and explanations given happily by the staff.Accomodation is really good and super clean, breakfast available every morning and offer you for 2â‚¬ the energy to walk down the streets and visit most of amazing spots of the city in walking distance. And for 10â‚¬ for dinner, you gonna have appetiser, a really good 3 courses menu cooked on place and.... all you can drink alcohol from 9pm to 11pm.So basically everything you need before going out to listen to some Fado music in Bairo Alto, have drinks in pink street or whatever youâ€™re keen for.Itâ€™s easy, you wake up, all the staff put you in an amazing mood that you will literally never forget.Overwelcoming, sympathical, smiley are the adjectives you will attribute to each of them with their personal special touch.Good feelings are also reflected on guestsâ€™s faces and motivation to make you spend great moment among your stay.My friend and I were really sad to leave after 4 awesome days, mostly landing in France with the most cloudy sky you could expect. You are literally wondering if is this not the next place you wanna move to.Highly recommended, I canâ€™t wait to go there again.If youâ€™re sad, take a brake, fly to Lisbon and book a YES hostel bed and let your troubles behind you.Florian and G.",Jan,2019,Jan 2019,2019-01-01,2019,5

I highlight Mrs. Erica Tavares, for her sympathy and effectiveness, is always ready to help with a smile on her face, and kindly explained to us the best that the area of Vila Franca do Campo has to offer us. I also highlight Mrs. Tânia Costa for his sympathy and professionalism in meeting our requests at the bar. We were very happy with our stay at Pestana.

Hotel El Rei Dom Manuel,Dunndus,50,Dunnduswrote a review Apr 2016,"It a nice hotel near fantastic vistas. It is a small hotel with its own restaurant serving good dinners. The owner has updated the rooms and he himself is charming. Perhaps I am a bit critical by giving it only three stars, but my room was too small. I had to jump over the suitcases to reach the bed. The bathroom is tiny, but has a small fantastic shower. Unfortunately, no bathtub. I have heard from other guests that their rooms were bigger, so my suggestion would be to ask to see the room",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,3

Pousada Viseu,paulandc0,472,paulandc0wrote a review Feb 2025,"A former hospital converted into a hotel. Beautiful house, spacious and comfortable rooms (we were upgraded due to low attendance).This Pousada does not have the historical charge or character of other Pousadas of the same group, but it is compensated by an interesting painting exhibition, and by the exhibition of a superb altarpiece made in 1947 to celebrate the 800 years of the reconquest on the Moors.We weren't impressed by the dinner centered on Portuguese recipes from the past.",Feb,2025,Feb 2025,2025-02-01,2025,4
O Castelo Guest House,Lynne P,65,Lynne Pwrote a review May 2025,"Stayed in the top room with a balcony and separate patio.As past reviewers have said, the location is excellent with an easy downhill walk into town and back again. I agree with all past positive reviews and staff were incredibly good and friendly.Things to know:- bathroom is small/tight but the views and location made up for it.- book a boat ride out to see the caves (leaves from beach below)- beach below did have sea weed but not many people swimming anyway so don’t think this is an issue.Did have some trouble getting hot water to upper level room (we had warm but not hot) - but staff were on it arranging for it to be repaired. Please report these things to staff so they are aware and can act on it - it impacts the guests who stay after.Did have some loud music noise on a weekend night coming from town - think it stopped around midnight. Perhaps this was a once off for a private event??Definitely would stay again. I would suggest the hotel include some drawers or baskets for small clothing items that can’t be hung.Thank you !",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,4
