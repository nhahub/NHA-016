Hotel Madeira,finbar,62,finbarwrote a review Dec 2016,"10 day stay for  middle aged couple . we wanted somewhere without any package holiday hoopla but close to  the city so we could have a proper mooch about. this place ticked pretty much all the boxes. room was small but clean and the bathroom shower was better than I had hoped.  Breakfast was plentiful and good. . staff were generally very friendly and the roof terrace was very  pleasant - both for lolling about in the day and for drinks in the evening. Location was outstanding. a walk to the harbour, theatre, restaurants and cable car. We were glad we paid ( a little) extra for a balcony. it was worth it. only reason not a 5 is that the towels provided were..... errrrr.... thin and had seen WAY better days. would be delighted to stay here again. MUCH more fun than an anodyne all inclusive.",Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,4

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,AnnieStormborn,67,AnnieStormbornwrote a review Dec 2013,"The 1BR apartment was modern, clean, and tastefully decorated.  Our room had a wonderful view of the Porto de Mós beach. The location was great. My husband and I hiked along the coast and walked by the beach every day. It was also about a 20 minute walk to the Ponte da Piedade- which is a must-see if you are visiting Lagos. The two restaurants at the nearby beach were very nice. If you have a car, you can easily go to the supermarkets and restaurants that are a short drive away. However, I wouldn't recommend driving (at night) to the center of Lagos if you are not used to driving on narrow streets surrounded by drunk people.Unfortunately, we stayed here on their off-season so some of the facilities that I was looking forward to using was not functional (the jacuzzis). It didn't really feel like a spa/resort for me. On our last day, they also closed the gym early without posting a notice/sign the day before.",Dec,2013,Dec 2013,2013-12-01,2013,3
Quinta Mirabela,TonymHove,94,TonymHovewrote a review Jul 2007,"This was our first trip to Madeira and we stayed at the Quinta Mirabela. The location has the great plus of having staggering views all over the Bay of Funchal from the terrace. It is half way between Funchal and the hill town of Monte and so you either need to hire a car (there is a car park opposite the hotel) or rely on taxis to go to and from the town or use the occasional bus service which goes from the bottom of the (very steep) hill on which the hotel is located.The Assistant Manager could not have been more welcoming on our arrival and showed us all the facilities of this very modern \"boutique\" style hotel. While our room was small it was very stylish and comfortable, looking out onto the pool area.The free gym and spa facilities were the best of any small hotel i have ever stayed in and there is free internet use for guests.Breakfast was a good standard apart from the lack of fresh juices and we had one excellent evening meal in the restuarant although service was very slow on a busy evening. The hotel provides a free courtesy bus service to Funchal each morning and evening at set times but to our surprise this didn't operate at weekends.The hotel is on the toboggan route from Monte to Funchal and so you hear the occasional scream from frightened tourists going downhill fast!!Overall we found the hotel of a good standard but it is not a good location for the infirm or for those wanting to be within walking distance of the sights of Funchal.",Jul,2007,Jul 2007,2007-07-01,2007,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Flyer61349536389,2,Flyer61349536389wrote a review Jul 2024,"This hotel has the potential to be excellent but it lets itself down in some very key areas.The hotel is in a lovely setting with beautiful views, but there were broken off tiles at the side of the pool that hadn’t been repaired. The sunbeds were plentiful but very uncomfortable.Lunch in the bar area was pleasant enough, although service was very slow and inattentive. We made the mistake of having dinner in The Mare Bistro and this was an awful experience. It took 90 minutes for us to get our main courses, service was very poor and the food, when it eventually came, was horrible. I suspect the pasta was microwaved because it was hot in places and very cold in others, the fajitas looked like dog food and didn’t taste much better, and the steak was overcooked and dry.The beds in the bedrooms were very comfortable and I slept brilliantly.All in all, I don’t think I would recommend this hotel. It’s not cheap and the service really lets it down.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,2

Within short walking distance to almost all landmarks.

Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,789tonygard,1,789tonygardwrote a review May 2019,"We stayed for 2 nights and expected a luxury winery with regard to the prices for accommodation and lunch/dinner. As we do have quite a broad experience with such places we were a little bit disappointed as some important details are overlooked. As we arrived we got no introduction to the side and the area about activities. Then, We were sitting at the pool, nobody talking to us, whether serving drinks voluntarily or saying that there will be installed a fence around the pool in a couple of minutes. Some workers came, built the fence in front of us that you feel like an idiot as we managed to order a drink short before they arrived. A nice pool, unusable and framed with an ugly fence disturbing the most beautiful view as nobody was working on the construction side afterwards totally unnecessary. The room was okay, I would give 3 stars from 5 for that. There are walking trails which are nice, but as you go directly out of the room to quite nice orange trees, you pass the burning side for trash including old matraces and plastic packages. This is not luxury. So I Hope you take that as serious advice for increasing quality. The dinner and lunch is tasting really good although it is very pricy for Portugal.",May,2019,May 2019,2019-05-01,2019,3

1e Carvoeiro,152joseantoniod,2,152joseantoniodwrote a review Apr 2019,The unit is nice and in a scenic location. It is a bit of steep walk down to the beach but not that far. Plenty of restaurants and bars in the town for a lively night life. Only problem we had was the internet was always cutting in and out also the tv signal did the same. The area has a great hiking trail along the cliffs for 11 kms and offers amazing views and vistas. It is called the Seven Valleys trail. There are 7 small quaint beaches along the way. The area is close to many other towns and attractions so plenty to do.,Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4

Luna Clube Oceano,morag b,8,morag bwrote a review Jul 2012,"We were 3 girls who booked through Jet 2 and would definitely book with them again, flights on time and quick transfer to apartments.  We had a one bedroom apartment on the 5th floor which was clean, very spacious and with a sea view. Apartments were cleaned every other day, although it was more of a quick wipe round than a thorough clean. Clean towels were provided twice during our weeks stay. The bed in living area was a pull out sofa bed and the mattress's were extremely thin. We had to put 2 mattress's on top of one another to make it comfortable, if both beds had to be used don't think you would get a goods night sleep.We went to the beach every day as not much atmosphere at the pool and was also on the receiving end of rude service from the woman who ran the beach bar. Had only been at the pool for an hour on the day of our arrival to be rudely told we couldn't eat our own crisps at the pool and to read the signs. When she was clearing up round the pool we told her which cans which we had purchased from the bar were empty and she told us where the bin was even though she was meant to be clearing up.Beach was only a few minutes walk away and paid 15 euros for 3 beds and an umbrella. But you also were able to use the bed tickets to receive discount at the beach bar. An easy walk to the old town in 15mins, even with heels on, just watch for the cobbles and 10mins in the opposite direction to the strip. Preferred the old town to the strip as the atmosphere more relaxed with a wide range of ages. Would definitely go back to club oceano as long as only 3 to an apartment due to the beds in the living area.",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,4

Luna Clube Oceano,clairebear876,3,clairebear876wrote a review Sep 2011,"We stayed 5 nights in the Clube Oceano and were very pleased with our apartment. We had a one bedroom apartment which came with a well equipped kitchen and spacious living / dining room area. Overall the apartment was clean and well air conditioned. The beds were comfortable and maid came every day except Sunday. The staff at the apartment are very friendly and helpful and spoke perfect english. We only spend one afternoon at the pool as we prefer the beach. The pool itself is ok but the sunbeds are not very comfortable...The location of Clube Oceano was perfect for us, half way between old town and bottom of the street. It took us approx 15mins walk into the old town at night, however if you prefer a taxi expect to pay about 4 / 5 euros. You can also walk along the beach during the day into the old town. If you like the beach there is a great beach 5 mins walk down hill. Two sunbeds (padded) & a parasol can be rented for the day for 10 euros, however if you go to old town beach expect to pay 15 euros.The supermarket just up from the apartments is reasonable enough and has good selection of wine, fresh fruit, breads etc and not overly priced.Overally would def recommend these apartments to anyone who wants to be within walking distance to the beach and near the old town.",Sep,2011,Sep 2011,2011-09-01,2011,4

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",white100,176,white100wrote a review Oct 2018,"Having been here 10 years ago it hasn't changed. This is an old fashioned hotel with old fashioned service. Expect Agatha Christie's Poirot to pop his head around every corner and or Sir Winston Churchill who loved this place and used to spend his time painting the local scenery. The one thing that is not old fashioned are the comfortable rooms with a soft luxurious bed, not an amazing size but big enough and overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The food down at the Pool bar where they serve breakfast is good and the service attentive. We were part of a large group around 80 people who had use of the Ballroom during our special evening with everyone dressed for the occasion, great fun. Basically you can't fault this hotel it is 5 star through and through, go and enjoy its history, its comfort and its splendid service.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

Hotel gas undergone a refurb and it shows. All parts of the hotel looking very fresh and it has been done to a high standard. Family rooms are really suites but bathrooms are very plus and huge. Sea views are wonderful so probably worth the extra. Staff are excellent and very accommodating.

Saccharum,Kim N,34,Kim Nwrote a review Apr 2017,"We (a family with a 14 year old boy and 11 year old girl) wanted to go to a hotel that focused on relaxation and chilling. The Savoy Saccharum certainly lived up to that requirement! It is a very professionally run and modern hotel with a focus on calm and quiet. It is (deliberately) not a place for families wishing to make noise at the pool. Our children were treated very well but it was clear from the start that they were at an adult hotel without animation/pool activities etc. Not a problem for us as our stay in Madeira was planned with stuff to do on the island every day.The food in the restaurants was very good, The breakfast buffet was fantastic! The other restaurants offered very nice food for adults and had options for the kids to choose although this was more limited. We never used the buffet as it was ridiculously expensive (35 per person in our case, excluding drinks!).We had booked (and paid for) a room with a direct sea view. The room they initially offered us was not such a room. We raised the issue, and the concierge Jose was fantastic. We were given some options (none of which were really what we had paid for) and we settled on a room - 625 - that in fact had a really nice view and was perfect for a family such as ours (it had a separate room with a sofabed for the kids). The hotel also compensated us with cheese and bubbly as compensation for the mix-up. Very professionally done. Jose treated us fantastically throughout our stay. His priority was to make sure we were well looked after and this made the stay wonderful. Thanks Jose!We made good use of the spa and gym. We had to pay extra for the spa. Note that kids under 16 are not allowed access to either. This really is a hotel catering for luxury and wellness for adults.If you are travelling as a couple you will love this hotel! It is designed for you! If you are travelling with children you can have a wonderful time there as long as you are realistic about the options for the kids. My wife and I are already considering going back at the next opportunity when both kids are otherwise engaged...",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,4

The breakfast is the best thing this place. Both the variety and the staff. The definition of suits here are something else than we are used too. We had a suit but we expected more. It was dark and not so romantic and welcoming.We have three concerns regarding the hotel.1) The cleaning. It was not satisfying. We have to say even dirty and discussing. Especially in the bathroom. See photo.2) The wifi. It was not functional over the whole hotel area. And when functional the speed was really, really slow!3) The distance to the city center. It is a least a 20 min walk down to the city center.We can recommend this place for short stays. We stayed here for 9 nights and won't do that again.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4

Ideally located close to restaurants and shops , all reasonably priced and friendly. Buses run on the nearest street to Falesia,Vilamoura,and Albufeira. There are two beaches about 20minutes walk away but I would recommend going further to Olhos d'gua which is smaller but more traditional village and less commercial.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,5
Pestana Viking,Magnus F,9,Magnus Fwrote a review Sep 2012,"First impressions are usually the decider for me when checking into a hotel, and I must say that the young receptionist that checked us in for a 9 night stay sold the hotel to me. She was very helpful and efficient.We had booked with Jet2 a suite for the holiday, but the room was not what I considered a suite.Basically we had a bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and a sitting /dining room with a two ring cooker, microwave and fridge and a toilet adjoining. We really weren't interested in cooking on holiday but that's maybe the Portugese suite.The housemaid kept the room very clean each day and all communal areas were kept clean each day. the sea view from the room was nice, overlooking the pool and lounger area and sitting on the balcony at night sipping a gin and tonic watching the sunset was very pleasant.The pool area was again kept clean and tidy, drinks were expensive from the pool bar but again with one exception the staff were friendly and helpful.The afternoon pool sports seemed to be set up for the local youths, and they took over the pool for an hour along with loud music, basically residents couldn't use the pool. The no saving loungers with towels policy didn't seem to be enforced. people vanished for hours on end and the towels stayed put. The pool was salt water but a nice temperature and i noticed that the quality sampling was carried out regularly. The food in the pool area was good and varied each day.The only meals we had was breakfast and a few pool side lunches, the breakfast was good and dishes were replaced quickly if coming empty. The fresh fruit was good and there was always a queue  for the personally cooked omelette.We didn't use any of he other facilities, the indoor pool was usually full of young children and not a option.Wi-Fi was available in the reception and computers were available at reasonable rates.I would suggest that the local bus timetables be available at reception as the hotel is a 5 Euro taxi ride from the town centre.All in all a good hotel and staff very efficient and helpful.As a General Manager for a hotel I feel competent to make the above remarks.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,4

Hotel Gat Rossio,Steve,73,Stevewrote a review Nov 2014,"Couldn't fault this place. Central location, close to railway station, a few yards from a Tourist Information Office. Reception staff were friendly and spoke perfect English. We had requested a quiet room on the top floor and thats what we got. Room, albeit on the small side, had a comfy double bed, was spotlessly clean and when I did have one small problem the staff dealt with straight away. The buffet breakfast was perfect for my taste with fruit juices, yoghurts, cereals, cold meats and cheeses, boiled egg, toast and marmalade, fresh fruit. Excellent value for money.

The view across the valley was stunning. The Convent is 4 star and the service excellent. Surrounded by woodland in a quite remote location.We had a log burning in the fire place , although the room was covered by both air conditioner and additional heaters.The bed was very comfortable with excellent mattress and quality natural duvet.",Feb,2018,Feb 2018,2018-02-01,2018,4

Pestana Viking,_getinureds,1,_getinuredswrote a review Apr 2019,"We stayed at an apartment at Pestana Viking last week and, overall, it was an enjoyable stay.The reception area is smart with a good outdoor and indoor swimming facility. However, the indoor pool looked a bit murky and, a few years ago, I had a bad ear infection after doing lots of swimming in the indoor pool.Also, the gym area has a few decent machines, mainly weights, but they definitely need to invest in some more cardio machines - they only have 1 old treadmill, one old bike with broken plastic parts, 2 cross trainers (1 with a faulty screen) and a rower with a screen that doesn't work. I came 10 years ago and I don't think these machines have been replaced since - the seat post of the bike keeps dropping as well. So, overall, the gym area is a bit disappointing.Also, the wifi for the apartment was down, apparently due to a fire in one of the garages, which now looks a bit of an eye sore. I believe this has also led to the tennis court looking in a very bad state and not being used. The lack of wifi wasn't great.Also, the bar staff at the pool bar could do with cheering up a bit but it's a good enough facility.In addition, at the round pool, there is now a number lock on one of the gates but the other is open to the public, which doesn't make sense to me, so it would be good if both gates were locked.Overall, the hotel is fine but I wouldn't recommend it as somewhere to go if you want to stay fit while on holiday.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,3
Luna Hotel Da Oura,Jackie H,14,Jackie Hwrote a review Jul 2016,"This was a very last minute booking. Passport arrived at 4.30 in the afternoon and we booked this holiday at 5.00pm with the help of the travel agents.Portugal  came up  as quite a good deal along with the hotel/apartment. We flew very early the next morning.On arrival at the hotel the reception was really lovely with a glass waterfall and very modern set up. The room was not ready but we were shown an area to change and to leave our luggage as it was so hot.On getting in to the room it was quite a surprise. We had booked a one bed room apartment for 4 adults. The room was basic with a  bathroom  shower/bath etc, small kitchen with microwave, dishwasher,fridge,etc.  and pull down bed all very new. The great bit was the stairs in the apartment which led to an upstairs bedroom and another bathroom! very basic but with two teenage girls it was a great bonus.The room had a balcony and also its own sun terrace up in the bedroom this was great. Both rooms also had air con which was a plus in the heat we had.The rooms and hotel were very clean and tidy at all times.The staff in the hotel are very friendly and nothing too much trouble.The pool is shared with the apartments next door and during our stay had a new delivery of sunbeds so did not struggle getting a bed everyday.The pool bar is ok  but probably during high season could do with more staff.The hotel is close to the Strip but not too close to be disturbed by noise and about ten taxi mins away from the old town. There is a round about close by with some traffic noise but who cares when you have a pool and sunshine and the double glazing at night does not let traffic sound throughA great stay for a very last min holiday!",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,melinda_guihal,18,melinda_guihalwrote a review May 2024,"Hotel a little far from the city center but easy to access by public transport.- Reception: negative point, no effort to speak French to us (sorry but for a 5* hotel it is the basis to speak several languages). We feel like we're bothering them when we ask them something.- Breakfast: big positive point for the lady who welcomes us. She is very kind and speaks French very well. Large selection of products, there is something for everyone.- Swimming pool: not great, cold water and not a warm place. Swimming cap obligatory â‚¬3 but after a day of walking it feels good.- Room: very spacious, cleaning done every day and towels changed. Little touches (chocolate) left on the desk. The only downside I would say is the stained carpet.Not trying the restaurant because we preferred to eat in more typical, warm and much cheaper places.We had a pleasant stay.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,4
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,razzLondon,82,razzLondonwrote a review Sep 2019,"Firstly the hotel has a huge lack of customer service.Place is very dirtyHot tub has visible scum around the rimFood is appalling for vegetariansStaff will fob you off just so they don't have to assist youSofa bed my kids were using was filthy and disgustingWe stayed here for 5 days and towels were never changed nor the room cleanedThe food and beverage manager mentioned above has to be the worst I have come across, he even swore at me. His assistant on duty was much better and in my opinion has better customer service skills then he had. Amshu never assisted or even tried to help our situation but aggravated and made things worse. He was very very rude, swore at me, argued in front of the other guests (having spoken with other restaurant staff along with others guests they all agreed that he was a very rude and an arrogant person).If your vegetarian I wouldn't bother booking half board as you would be expected to eat chips and vegetables daily. My issue that I tried to explain to amshu was that 98% of the guests were meat eaters and so how difficult is it to cater for the 2% of vegetarian guests should they have any special requirements? Amshus assistant agreed and helped alot on our last night as he arranged a nice vegetarian dish for us to eat.Wouldn't recommend this hotel nor stay at that particular branch ever again. IV stayed in many Muthu hotels and have never been treated like this. Certain staff there have really let it down. Cleaning staff, front desk and food beverage staff require additional training. We are paying guests and shouldn't be treated in this manner. I will take this complaint to the highest level to ensure Amshu doesn't treat other guests how we were treated.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,2

I have visited many times and I'm sure I'll visit, many more.Situated in a quiet spot on the edge of town and about a 25 minute drive from Porto Airport, the rear of the hotel overlooks fields and orchards, providing beautiful views whilst eating breakfast (which is one of the most varied and high-quality buffets I've tried) and a perfect start to the day.There is also a separate bar (where you can also eat) and terrace overlooking this area, too.The staff are very attentive and nothing is too much trouble. The front desk can staff speak multiple languages which makes visitors feel more comfortable with their stay.The room are very comfortable and well appointed with workspace area, WiFI, large screen TV and an excellent minibar which puts some higher-end hotels to shame.A great mix of tranquility, with the option of visiting the bustling town if you want to be somewhere more lively. It's been consistently excellent and I've been regularly staying here for the last four years.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,5

Hotel The Cliff Bay,mike m,0,mike mwrote a review Apr 2025,"Don’t expect to get into the Michelin starred restaurant- we tried for the  six days we were here and failed. Almost as bad in their other restaurants. My wife was so horribly treated in their spa she felt humiliated in front of other guests and came away tearful. Despite booking in advance she was turned away and told she couldn’t have a foot and lower leg massage because she had breast cancer. Their level of communication is awful and complaining to so-called guest relations an infuriating waste of time. If cancer patients are to be excluded, then they need to be explicitly told so beforehand . That said, there is no medical reason why anyone on oral chemotherapy need be refused a foot massage - indeed it’s one of the things oncologists encourage. Staff in the bars and breakfast rooms were wonderful but I’d rather drink bleach than ever stay here again!",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,1
Pestana Bahia Praia,ajuliaw65,47,ajuliaw65wrote a review Sep 2015,"My kids and I stayed 9 nights in the Bahia Palace and had the most wonderful time.  The thing that was most special was the attitude of the staff.  I arrived in a bit of a panic because I had been unable to hire a car online and at the airport I had been assured that there were no hire cars available until October, this in mid-August.  On my first morning, Nelson found me a car within 30 seconds.  Not for nothing has he been awarded employee of the month for several months running but he is ably assisted by Dora, Lucia, Priscilla and Anna and others whose name I did not learn.  They helped us with maps, gave restaurant recommendations, got us taxis, printed out our boarding passes and delivered them at midnight to our door and then sent an email to check we had got them.  But what about the hotel? Yes, a little faded from past glories but still our room was huge, was kept clean, had a wonderful balcony with a wonderful view and I miss that huge marble bathroom.  There was tennis and table tennis and a pool table.  The pool was wonderful and there were always sun loungers available and clean towels were provided daily.  And the beach was just glorious and was just a short walk away.  The only downside was the food was not perfect.  I found breakfast the least inspiring with sugary fruit juice drinks, coffee from a machine and processed cheese when there is so much nice cheese on the island.  Dinners a la carte were good though and the serving staff were always the same so you got to know them and they were always smiling and helpful.  Highly recommended though I am glad we got that car. There is a minibus daily to Ponta Delgada and you are on a major bus route.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4
