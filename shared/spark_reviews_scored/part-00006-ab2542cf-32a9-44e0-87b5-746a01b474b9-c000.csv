Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Leebee,74,Leebeewrote a review Aug 2025,"This hotel is a 2 star property with a 5-star view—and unfortunately, that view is the only real highlight.Check-In ExperienceWe arrived at 12 PM and were told our room wasn’t ready, which was understandable. We were assured that we’d receive a call when it became available—but no call or message ever came. When we returned after 3 PM, we were shocked to find our luggage and personal belongings—including passports, phones, and other valuables—left unattended in reception for three hours, completely visible to anyone walking by. We were originally told the bags would be stored securely, which clearly didn’t happen.The receptionist noticed us spotting the bags and quickly checked us in. No information was provided about the hotel, facilities, or even where or when breakfast was served. He simply stated we had been “upgraded” to a partial view room as a gesture for our 10-year anniversary. However, I had already booked a superior room with a terrace and had specifically requested a double bed.Room IssuesWhat we received was a twin room with two single beds and a locker in between. We had to rearrange the room ourselves to make it more suitable. Given the receptionist’s attitude—acting as though we were lucky to get what we did—we didn’t feel comfortable complaining, for fear of being moved to something worse.To make matters worse, the air conditioning didn’t function properly at night. It became increasingly warm and stuffy, and the unit just made noise without cooling the room, leaving us waking up with headaches each morning.Pool & FacilitiesThe pool area is overcrowded and poorly managed. Sunbeds are “reserved” by guests placing towels on them from 8 AM, and these beds often go unused for hours. At a hotel marketed as luxury, this should not be acceptable. There should be a system where unused towels and items are cleared and stored, allowing fair access for all guests.The VIP cabana area is an insult to guests. You’re charged €75 for a bed that faces an ugly green fence, with no food or drink included. It should either be included in the price of your stay or offered at a more reasonable rate with better value.Staff & ServiceWe witnessed rude behaviour from several staff members, particularly at breakfast. Some guests seated themselves due to a lack of staff presence, which led to visible frustration and dismissive body language from senior staff. There’s clearly a lack of hospitality training, especially among those who seem to be in supervisory roles.The overall atmosphere was chaotic and impersonal. It felt more like being herded through a system than enjoying a relaxing getaway. For a 7-night stay at €2800 with only buffet breakfast, this was far from the premium experience we were expecting.Final Frustration at Check-OutTo top it all off, check-out was equally frustrating. A young staff member spoke in Portuguese to her colleague about our reservation and seemed uncertain about what to do. She then informed us we had $150 in credit—which we couldn’t use because we had only spent around $30 at the pool bar. This was the first time we heard anything about having credit included in our stay. No one mentioned it at check-in, reinforcing how poorly the process was handled from the beginning.Aside from the stunning view, our stay was riddled with poor service, disappointing facilities, and a lack of professionalism. Sadly, we won’t be returning, and I cannot recommend this hotel to others expecting a premium experience.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,2

Saccharum,jillhQ1938DT,0,jillhQ1938DTwrote a review May 2016,"Accommodation excellent but service leaves a lot to be desired. We never found the main pool as the indication was that you had to pay for it through the spa and we weren't prepared to pay extra. Never used the spa as it is not our 'thing'. Only found the al a carte restaurant just before the end of our holiday. We'd found a very good local restaurant so weren't prepared to pay more for what could be an inferior menu. Information in the rooms was poor especially as it was a very quiet area. Their restaurant & menus with prices; bus timetable & places to visit; car hire information are all things that would be useful in rooms. We were booked in for bed and breakfast only which was superb but the way we were treated in the buffet on our first night was so bad that we left to eat outside the hotel and had we paid for half board I would have been onto the travel company immediately. This stopped us from even considering eating in the buffet again. The accommodation, cleanliness of the rooms, kettle & fridge were supplied, the balcony was great all these were superb. I feel that it is a new hotel with staff having a lot to learn.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,3

Herdade Da Matinha,PizzaGirl999,8,PizzaGirl999wrote a review Dec 2014,"I have stayed at Herdade da Matinha twice now and have never been disappointed. Tastefully decorated and in a beautiful location, the hotel feels like a family home. Monica and Alfredo are warm and friendly people, nothing is ever too much trouble and all the staff go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay. The horse riding is great fun and Mariana is very friendly.The food is excellent, with a great selection for the breakfast buffet.On the negatives, I really can't think of very much! It's very remote (we love that, but others might not). The dinner is quite pricey, and there are no other options nearby, but the food is excellent even though you can't choose from different options as it is a set menu. Overall though a fantastic experience and we will be returning again and again!",Dec,2014,Dec 2014,2014-12-01,2014,4

There is something for everyone at Belmar Resort and the location is perfect near the Porto do Mos beach (including restaurants) and an easy 5 minute taxi/drive or 25-30 minutes walk to Lagos centro.There is a choice of pool areas to suit adults &/or families. Pool side bars with great choice of food & drinks during the day. Good quality restaurant food too. Friendly staff, great service & very comfortable, well maintained bedrooms with daily housekeeping service (we stay in a studio apartment). There is also the gym, spa & indoor pools plus some lovely panoramic walks nearby. Highly recommended!",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,5
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Mafalditus,60,Mafaldituswrote a review Jul 2017,"The location is great, the staff is super helpful, the beds are comfortable, you have a locker and the rooms are spacious, they have a good kitchen and common areas,  and they offer tons of activities to socialize. What else can you ask for?As it happens a lot with hostels, especially when you go to a dom, it's a matter of luck with the people you meet. I had a great time in this sense.I would definitely recommend it.Tip: the rooms in the ground floor are noisier since they face the street, and even though they have blinds, sometimes when it's a big dorm people want the windows open for air, so ask for a room upstairs if possible.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,4
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Leanne,1,Leannewrote a review Oct 2023,"Had a nice stay at the Dona Filipa. Breakfast was lovely as was the swimming pool with stunning views of the ocean. The Praca is literally on your doorstep! Lots of nice restaurants to choose from. My only fault is the room we had! Having seen other people’s reviews of the classic rooms on here I was hoping we wouldn’t get the same but unfortunately we did! We were on level 1 basically basement level, they were clean but are in desperate need of a refurb. The worse thing was the smell of damp in the room, it’s just fortunate that we were hardly in there. I did ask for a refurb room but was told the hotel was full but when a family member complained he got moved straight to a new room?!If you book this hotel I strongly advise you ask for a refurbished room! Apart from that a very nice stay.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,4

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",snipsnapsnorum,216,snipsnapsnorumwrote a review Sep 2019,"We spent 8 days here and had an Ocean suite with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen and living room with a dining area.   So there was plenty of space for the 5 members of our family which included our 3 year old grandson.  The suites were exceptionally clean and housekeeping did a full clean each day.  We had half board but the kitchen was equipped with everything you could possibly need to cook your own meals.  The resort is huge but the shuttle service will transport you wherever you want to go.  You would need a taxi to get to Albufeira.   As others have commented the pools are freezing cold so we migrated to the beach on several occasions, however, although the lift takes you down there is a long board walk with many steps before you get to the beach.  Not too bad going down but pretty daunting especially for a 3 year old on the way back in the heat of the day.  We were very disappointed with the food - O Grill was a buffet which was okay but not as good as we were expecting, the Corda cafe was dreadful and overcharged us which took considerable time to correct, the steak house was mediocre.  If the resort was closer to Albuferia then we would have tried other restaurants instead of half board.  We had a terrace with a tiny garden but with hindsight would have preferred a balcony suite.  The staff were pleasant and helpful.  Overall not 5 star quality more 4 star.  Would we return - unlikely because the beach was too much of a trek, the pools too cold to enjoy and the food not up to our standards.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

The hotel itself is nice, the location is excellent and the staff are extraordinarily nice, the room we received was on the second floor, overlooking a noisy construction site, starting in the morning hours. My wife had a hard time with here  makeup when there was no mirror on the dressing table. Even though we stayed for 4 nights and asked for a different room we coudn't get one/.The hotel does not have a swimming pool, or SPA . I think it is suitable for 4 stars, not 5.

Montebelo Viseu Congress Hotel & Spa,KerryLouLou,84,KerryLouLouwrote a review Jun 2014,"stayed here for 4 nights with a friend who was working in town.  Lovely twin room with balcony.  Plenty big enough.  Free wifi.  A shame there was no tea / coffee making facilities in the room.  Staff werent overly helpful on arrival.  Normally at a 5* hotel a bell boy will be rushing out to the taxi to meet you and take your luggage.  There was no such service at the Montebelo.  The reception staff were not overly helpful.  I even had to ask where the lifts to the rooms were.  Very strange, as my experience of customer service everywhere else in Viseu was outstanding.  The indoor pool area is nice but very dimly lit.  There are nice loungers around the pool and plenty of towels.  The saunas and steam rooms were not working for the length of my stay.  Drank in the hotel bar a few times.  Ate dinner in the restaurant one night.  Had a set menu for about 20 euros which included starter, main course, dessert and a glass of wine.  The soup was tepid.  The roast veal main was very nice.  A good choice of desserts on the dessert buffet.  The breakfast buffet selection was good.  A variety of pastries, meats, cheeses, fruits, yogurts, juices, pancakes, cereals and even bacon and scrambled eggs.  Ham on the bone is carved for you if you want it.  There is spumante once you ask for the bottle to be opened.  Normal coffee is available to help yourself to, but others coffees (espresso etc) can be ordered.  I found the staff at breakfast the friendliest in the hotel.  The hotel was incredibly quiet.  Whether by the pool, at breakfast, in the bar or in the restaurant.  I'm sure i never saw more than half a dozen other people.  In a very large hotel this just felt a little eerie.  I would agree with other reviews about this really being 4* not 5.",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,3

Hyatt Regency Lisbon,Rbw8888,0,Rbw8888wrote a review Mar 2024,"Our recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Lisbon Hotel exceeded all expectations.We chose this hotel for two main reasons, both of which greatly enhanced our overall experience.Firstly, as loyal members of the Hyatt rewards program, we were able to use our points to book a suite at the hotel. The suite provided us with a much larger room than standard accommodations, and the value of the points redemption was fantastic. This allowed us to enjoy a heightened level of comfort and luxury throughout our stay.Secondly, the suite we booked came equipped with a washing machine/dryer combination unit. This feature proved to be an invaluable asset during our extended trip through Spain and Portugal, allowing us to conveniently launder our clothes without the need for external services or facilities.The property exuded a sense of freshness and cleanliness, indicative of its status as a new establishment. Moreover, the location of the hotel proved to be ideal, with major attractions such as the Tower of Belem within minutes walking distance.One of the highlights of our stay was the breathtaking view of the river that we enjoyed from our room. And you can do morning jogging along the river.",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,5
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Pamela L,47,Pamela Lwrote a review Jan 2016,"We had a lovely stay at Valverde.  It is a pretty small hotel with excellent decor and rooms.  The absolute best part about this hotel is the service.  We stayed for three nights and after the first night we were upgraded.  The classic room we were in to start was very nice but the suite was amazing!  Every person working at this hotel is willing to help.  I was sick one day and anytime someone saw me they would ask how I was feeling.  The location is pretty good, probably not the best in Lisbon but it is easy to get around everywhere so it wasn't a problem.  I would say the one thing I didn't like, which is hard to find, is that the basement level where they have breakfast smelled a little funny, like bad water.  I'm not sure what that was but it obviously didn't impact my stay too much because we absolutely loved it here and would return.  Overall this was a great experience and we really really loved all the staff!!",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,4

Independente Principe Real,Mona B,18,Mona Bwrote a review Jan 2018,"I had a hugely enjoyable stay at The Independente over New Year's eve. It makes such a difference not staying in a generic chain in a city, particularly a beautiful city like Lisbon. I stayed in the hotel, which had a lot of quirky touches and furnishings as well as useful amenities--hairdryer and coffee machine. My room was lovely and spacious, and although my friend's room was quite a bit smaller, she had no complaints. Breakfast is on the roof terrace that doubles up as a bar and restaurant in the evenings, and was wonderful. The woman who took care of the breakfast area could not have been more friendly and accommodating. The staff are also super-friendly and helpful, more than happy to help with local recommendations and directions etc. We spent New Year's Eve in the ground floor restaurant, The Decadente, and it was a great evening and lovely to be able to just roll up to bed afterwards.Just one thing to take note of: because the Insólito bar is situated on the roof terrace, it does get noisy at night as the clientele has to go past the rooms in order to get upstairs. This did not bother me at all, but I feel it is important to point out for someone who might need peace and quiet in order to get a good night's sleep. For some reason, I was also unable to pick up the wi-fi signal in my room during my stay and ended up having to use the communal areas. I think my room might have been in a dead spot as my friend had no problems.But other than this, it was a perfect stay and I would certainly go back there if I ever return to Lisbon.",Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,4

They were always helpful, smiling, and accommodating to all our requests.  We truly appreciated their kindness and professionalism, which made our trip even more memorable.The facilities and amenities of the hotel were top-notch, and we were impressed with the cleanliness and the attention to detail. The location was also perfect, and we were able to explore the city easily.We were celebrating my daughter's birthday on this trip.  I will never forget the smile on my daughter's face upon arrival. She was overjoyed and thrilled with the warm welcome and the special birthday surprise that the staff had arranged for her. It was a very kind gesture and made her day even more special.   I must say that the best part of the Lisbon trip was the hotel stay for my daughter.A big shout-out and my sincere gratitude to Mr. Elmar Derkitsch and Ms. Susana Magalhaes, for making great arrangements for our stay & continuously taking care of our comfort every step of the way.An easy 10 out of 10 bright stars for this hotel.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,5

I only want to leave a love letter (although it’s hard to find the right words to do so).From the moment we entered the beautiful Torel Palace, my days have been overwhelmed with affection, attention, sympathy, care and mimos! That feeling you sometimes have with family or friends. Despite the constant cordiality, the humor was undoubtedly my color. The concierge Tiago is one of those people who goes beyond our needs and expectations and there was always an “extra mile” that left us delighted.The hotel is extremely welcoming despite the imposition and beauty of the building, but the staff leave that place an even more beautiful place.As I said in a beautiful painting that was on a wall and that rejoiced me in the morning:“The smile you offer will return to you again” (Guerra Junqueiro).

Royal Savoy Hotel,Delia P,317,Delia Pwrote a review Feb 2020,"We stay at the Royal Savoy as often as we can and I am disappointment to read the review listed before mine as a home for elderly people. We are not old and certainly do not like to be judged like this. There are many return guests as this is predominately a timeshare hotel and those that visit often take great comfort in the warmth and hospitality shown by the staff mainly, because they recognise us and we recognise them. It’s simply like returning home after an absence.We enjoyed great service and super hospitality from the waiters to the reception staff, from the owners relations to the managers.  Nothing is too much trouble and although sometimes things  take a little time to happen, if there are things troubling the guests, they will try their best to help solve them.Anyway the reason for my review.We tried the buffet breakfast for the first time today and were very pleasantly surprised by the array of choices. We then added an afternoon tea to the many experiences we have not had here. My biggest regret was not taking photographs as this afternoon tea was epic.  I cannot believe I haven’t done this before and more surprisingly I’m amazed more residents haven’t tried it. The food was hands down so much better than Reid’s at a fraction of the price and the only draw back was perhaps the setting wasn’t so opulent. There was a lady playing a harp and the most delightful waitress looking after us. I’m sure if this were advertised and opened to the guests in the other hotels or passing trade, this could be a real hit. We for certain will repeat both the breakfast service and the afternoon tea again.In summary the hotel is for everyone and this week it has been wonderful to see young families and children in the pools on what has been the hottest two weeks we’ve ever had in Madeira. We cannot wait to return.",Feb,2020,Feb 2020,2020-02-01,2020,3
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Suzanne D,88,Suzanne Dwrote a review May 2018,"Beautiful modern coastal design throughout; exquisite views of the sea and rocky cliffs; room and public areas all very clean, all-in-all, a very comfortable and relaxing stay.  Free breakfast buffet had lots of variety -- everything you could want.  I found the selection in both restaurants to be rather limited.  However, we did enjoy our meal in The One, the fine dining restaurant.  There's a number of good restaurants within a 5-minute walk, and beyond.  Highly recommended.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,4
Hotel Gat Rossio,sighip,90,sighipwrote a review Jan 2013,"Hotel Gat is one of those old buildings redone to be a funky modern hotel that makes the most out of the space you have. The rooms are small in the standard european small sense, but are still functional and tidy.Clean, modern and fitted out with LCD TVs and aircon. Albeit small, the room is comfortable to be in. Bathroom is small, in typical european fashion, and while I might have complained about it before, compared to some other hotels I've stayed in, it's spacious (at least the shower is slightly separate from the toilet/basin area).Sleep was average - bed was \"just\" good but the lighting from outside (the green lights from the buildings exterior) and some early morning noise took off a few marks here. Don't get me wrong - you'll sleep fine - but I don't know if you'll be able to have an extended sleep in or not.Location is spot on. It's seconds away from the local metro stop, and about 1-2 minutes walk to the main square. There are several supermarkets around, albeit not so obvious to the untrained eye at first. Likewise, the train station that takes you to Sintra is just down the road (in an unhelpful unmarked building... look out for starbucks on the inside). Anyway, in short, can't get a better location, especially if coming/going from the airport (Take the Metro to the airport, it is less than 3 EUR each and is quicker than the bus and cheaper than the taxi, and lands you almost right outside the hotel).Value: Reasonable to Very Good value for money, given the location, modern nature of the rooms, and breakfast service.Breakfast: Your typical meats, cheeses, fruit, cereals, toasts, self-boiled eggs, and some local Portuguese foods (pastries), however I would rank the quality of the food/ingredients as superior to most.",Jan,2013,Jan 2013,2013-01-01,2013,4

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Jon A,4,Jon Awrote a review Nov 2016,"My wife, my son and I stayed in the Crowne Plaza for a week at the end of October and can highly recommend it.The hotel is in a great location, right next to the beach and is only a 5 to 10 minute walk from the bustling Vilamoura Marina with its large selection of restaurants and bars.The room was clean and tidy, with a nice comfy bed, adequate clothes storage space and although the shower was great, the only slight negative point regarding the room was the glass 'wall' separating the bathroom from the main room and having to lower, then raise the privacy blind every time either of us needed the toilet or a shower. This was a very minor inconvenience though and probably wouldn't bother most families.  We only ordered room service once and it was delivered to us within 20 minutes by one of the ever friendly staff.Breakfast at the hotel is a fantastic selection ranging from full 'English' type breakfast, continental ham and cheese, fruit and yogurt to several different cereals.  Queuing is not really a problem even when arriving late (after 10:15) and we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated.The hotel bar is a great place to relax, with comfy seating, two pool tables, a PS3 and several TV's showing the latest live sports and again with staff who were really friendly.The weather wasn't brilliant for half of our weeks stay, so time around the pool was limited, but as with the rest of the hotel, I couldn't fault it. There's plenty of sun beds to choose from and the hotel pool is one of the largest I've used, if a little bit chilly, which was understandable being the end of October.I don't like to go to the same resort twice as there's too much of the world to see, but if I was to go to Vilamoura again, I would certainly go back to the Crowne Plaza.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,4

Room was cleaned every day. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Had a bit of trouble getting to grips with opening and locking the door into the apartment but the handy man came passed and tinkered with it which helped. Vast choice of restaurants. Pools looked clean and nice to see hot tub drained each day, not that we used it. The place is a bit of a maze but once you get familiar, easy enough to get in and out of complex. Very annoying that people leave the secure gates wide open instead of locking like the notice on the gate says. Will definitely stay here again.",Feb,2024,Feb 2024,2024-02-01,2024,4

There were 15 of us in total, a large group in several rooms. We were all upgraded to sea view. Twin rooms are a reasonable size, with a sunny balcony. Bathroom is open to the room with a glass wall, but you can pull down a blind. Coffee machine, but after the first 4 the Nespresso is 2 euros so take some with you. Breakfast was a good selection of fresh fruits, fresh squeezed orange juice, pastries. I didn't eat the cooked things, but am told the omelettes were v good.Pool area was busy but we managed to get enough beds every day, we preferred the grass area. Amazing, huge pool. V close to the beach too.V small gym, and v hot, so don't get expectations up for that - of the 2 bikes, one was broken! On the last day we used the spa to have a shower, which looked lovely and was well worth 5 euros.Overall a very convenient hotel for the Marina, and would stay again.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Kimberley D,1,Kimberley Dwrote a review Aug 2019,"The hotel was lovely, the room was very big and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Lovely sized pools and clean. However, we were very disappointed by the all inclusive. You can only get drinks from the lower bar which is quite a walk from the main pool and you cannot get all inclusive drinks from the bar at the main pool? Which I donâ€™t understand why when you pay all inclusive you should be able to use any bar at the hotel. Also the cups are half the size than when you pay for a drink & you can only have two drinks at a time. The bar stops serving at 10:30pm and you are not allowed to take drinks to your room even though they are in plastic cups.The food doesnâ€™t have much variety especially for children. They only offer pizza, chicken nuggets or fish fingers & fries & thatâ€™s it all week.There is entertainment for children but none for adults apart from a singer, so doesnâ€™t really cater for younger people.Although, the hotel is a lovely hotel and very pretty at night and if your going away for a short stay I would recommend it just avoid the all inclusive because we ended up using more money than intended.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,2

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Mitchell_Lombard,6,Mitchell_Lombardwrote a review Aug 2016,"I could have easily given this hotel 5 stars with just a couple changes that seem absolutely standard for a hotel.  But unfortunately, it kind of screws up some important things, despite being very nice.GOOD- Location is awesome on the river, though this is bad if you want to be close to Bairro Alto/downtown.- Breakfast, aside from the eggs, was absolutely phenomenal.  Fresh squeezed juice and huge variety.  No pancakes or waffles, but I was very pleased anyway.- Super clean (though there was kind of a sickly sweet smell everywhere)- Great room, aside from the ridiculous lack of power outlets (more on that below).  We had kind of a balcony which was nice, and the beds were comfortable. Clean.  Huge shower and nice bathroom.- Super helpful and attentive staff.  They were absolutely above and beyond, and they helped me have fantastic voyages in Lisbon.  They went out of their way to make it easy for us.BAD- NO POWER OUTLETS IN THE ROOM. I'm not kidding or exaggerating.  Not one outlet on the wall.  I couldn't charge my phone unless I got down on my hands and knees, went down to the floor, under the desk, then pulled up a floor cover.  Under the floor cover, the TV was plugged in.  I had to unplug the TV, then I could charge ONE of our cellphones.  This oversight is so absolutely inexcusable that I can't even fathom what is going on.  The front desk even admitted that they wish the rooms had power outlets.  This is a very new hotel, so I'm totally bewildered.- Runny, watery scrambled eggs.  This is kind of the norm in Europe, so I didn't expect much else, but it still makes for a weak main course for breakfast if eggs are your thing.  Great breakfast otherwise though.- Stark, strangely empty dÃ©cor everywhere.  There are no paintings, no plants, no pictures, no decorative items in the corners of the hotel.  Everything is black and white.  What I think is that they want us to think they were going for a minimalist theme, but in reality, it is just empty and weird, and I think they just wanted to save money on decoration.  I know this is subjective, but it is ugly and empty and devoid of decoration inside the hotel.- Rooftop pool was too cold.  It was almost like a therapeutic cold pool you would use in physical therapy.  This is also subjective, but anyone who tried to dip their toes in it promptly decided not to, and this was the middle of July, so it was definitely not for lack of heat or sun outside.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,3

On the bright side if you’d rather skip breakfast there are several amazing cafes in town. Ok so to our room... we booked a double room with balcony and view. When we arrived we received a “complimentary upgrade” to a villa in the back of the property. Please be advised that it’s not easy to get there.You have to descend a long flight of stairs. And you will have to climb them again when you set out for your sightseeing. While views are abundant on the property the room in the villa only had a small window and no balcony to enjoy said views. The room was quite large. The bed was comfy. However no WiFi had been set up in the room yet and there is no tv. Which I didn’t care about either bc I was there to unplug, but it bugged my husband lol. The water pressure in the shower was nice. But the bathroom has no door so stepping out is very cold.
