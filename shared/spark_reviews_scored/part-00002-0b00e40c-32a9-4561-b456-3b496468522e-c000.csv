Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,svletas,185,svletaswrote a review Oct 2021,"This was our first trip to Lagos, though we've been to the Algarve before. We stayed 5 nights at Belmar and it was great, everything we wanted. Friendly staff at reception, good parking, nice one bedroom apartment with full kitchen, washer (key for all our laundry) large balcony overlooking the adult pool and the beach/ocean. Excellent buffet breakfast. Lots of families here, and ideal for that, though just a great overall base to stay and enjoy the Lagos area. Many excellent restaurants in the town, on the beach and in nearby Portimao. Our favorite beach was praia palmares. Also, close to praia camilo, one of the famous beaches down in the cliffs.",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,5

Quinta Mirabela,Cyclops1809,2,Cyclops1809wrote a review Jan 2016,"The Quinta Mirabela boasts 5 star rating and in our opinion has every right to do so.The Quinta Mirabela has managed, successfully, to combine friendly service and personal touch with all the requisite facilities for a 5 star hotel. From the moment we arrived, we felt completely relaxed and at home in the hotel and found the amenities and service to be excellent. On arrival we were presented with a cool glass of the most lovely sparkling wine and this subsequently turned out to be just one of the many \"personal touch\" experiences that made our stay so enjoyable.Breakfast is a self service buffet of truly generous proportions, supplemented with any type \"eggs to order\" from the kitchen and for the truly adventurous, sparkling wine is available at the buffet every morning! A continental breakfast can be taken on the balcony, overlooking Funchal and the Atlantic, if preferred.The restaurant has a locally renowned reputation to live up to and we experienced a superb candlelit dinner on the last night of our stay. We found the service to be professional, courteous and friendly.The location of the hotel is truly breathtaking, high above Funchal, south facing and with private balconies plus a swimming pool/sun lounge area and roof garden all affording superb views over Funchal harbour and the Atlantic Ocean as well as the surrounding areas on all sides. As if that were not enough, the hotel is situated on the road used to convey tourists by Toboggan down the hill from the Tropical Gardens at Monte.Access to the town is easily achieved by taxi (around 12Euro from the hotel) or by bus No.19 bus (>2 Euro per person) from the stop 5 minutes walk down the hill.The Toboggan station, together with shops and cafe, is also situated a short distance downhill from the hotel.Whilst it is possible to walk into Funchal (about 30mins), this is definitely NOT recommended as the road is dangerously steep and narrow in places believe me, we tried it and were thankfully rescued, half way down, by a very concerned taxi driver!!We booked a \"superior\" room and our 7 night stay at the Quinta Mirabela was wonderful, we would not hesitate to recommend it to our friends and relatives.",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Leanne D,1,Leanne Dwrote a review Oct 2022,"Just got back from a weeks holiday here with my partner.The staff were so welcoming when we arrived and absolutely lovely throughout the whole week.The room was really nice and clean, as well as the rest of the hotel (I’ve seen some reviews about the carpets although they are cleaned often they are just stained) I personally don’t think I’d want to be in the lower rooms (we was 4th floor)The rooftop bar was beautiful and so relaxing.We stayed for a week and got one free meal in two restaurants. The first restaurant “alecrin” was really nice, and 100% worth a visit.However the “taverna Portuguesa” was a bit of a let down in comparison we just got a plate of chicken which was fine considering it was free.The only let down for me was the food, it was often cold and boring, Which is to be expected at all inclusive I suppose.The drinks they served were named spirits instead of cheap stuff which I thought was a bonus.Overall had an amazing time, and will definitely be returning with my daughter as there was so much stuff for children there!🙂",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,4

The rooms are very clean,  animation team , slides and splash pool brilliant. The pools absolutely freezing, however this didn't stop kids from having fun.Downside of the week was the constant ques we had to stand in every night to get into the main resteraunt, it didn't matter what time you went there was a que to get in, a que then for the food, a que for the desserts. We had to wait a while to get drinks and hardly ever got top ups...one night I was shown to my table it was very busy so my husband stood In the que to get our food and I took our kids to get there food to return to our table to find people sitting there, I didn't want to make a fuss as the family had a baby and a toddler. I then had to tell the manager he had given our table to someone else, he apologised and because it was so busy and no free tables we were told there was tables outside. It was freezing cold, but outside we had to sit.The food and drink was nice, however it does need to looked at when the hotel is busy there should be more food stations. The a la carte was lovely, it's a shame tou could only have one visit. The pizza snack bar was lovely, freshly made, a big hit with the kids.We have had a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel, however be prepared for the ques.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,3

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,paula r,13,paula rwrote a review Aug 2023,"After deciding to stay another day on vacation, I chose the D Filipa hotel for its location.Despite having arrived early, I went to the hotel to find out if it was possible to leave my luggage there.I was received by a young woman who didn't speak Portuguese and who had some difficulty looking for the data requested on my citizenship card, asking her colleague and as if she were seeing such a document for the first time.I left my luggage, went to the beach and came back to prepare for dinner out, with little time left.When I opened the bedroom door, I saw that they hadn't brought my suitcase there.After a brief evaluation, I was able to verify that I was completely deceived and misled by what I had observed on Booking.An unpleasant room, completely dated and out of fashion, with dilapidated and uncomfortable furniture.If I hadn't made the reservation myself, I would have been convinced that I was staying in a modest guest house in the interior of the country...In addition to not having remote-controlled air conditioning (which forced me to get out of bed several times during the night), the bed had been moved but its headboard remained attached to the wall. The old lamps, without reading lights or wall switches. Bathroom with plastic curtain and blocked sink. So as not to extend myself any further. I have never stayed in a hotel like this in my entire life. And I can say that I've traveled a lot and know hotels in almost the entire world, with fewer stars and much more pleasant.The breakfast is quite modest, unacceptable for a 5-star hotel and for the amount charged.The only positive feature of this hotel, which doesn't even have any merit, is its location.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,2
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,MarshWall,28,MarshWallwrote a review Nov 2015,"We were slightly disappointed with this hotel - it didn't quite live up to expectations, but having said that, there are a number of plus points:Location - fabulous views out to sea, especially from the outdoor infinity pool area, which has glass panels to shield from the (quite strong) breezes and is generally lovely.The restaurant is very good. We had several very enjoyable lunches and dinners in addition to the excellent breakfasts.The staff are friendly and generally helpful.The gardens are lovely and well maintained.On the negative side the hotel is beginning to show signs of wear and tear. It is shabby in places and not as clean as it should be. More attention to detail needed here.We had a problem with noisy ventilation system which we reported and were told that this happens 'often'! To be fair, it did quieten down later at night for some mysterious reason.The bar staff weren't as good as they should have been- very slow and got one order horribly wrong.A good hotel, but needs a review to keep standards higher.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,3
Captain's Log House,melbourneff,7,melbourneffwrote a review Jul 2018,"Travelled from Australia to surf. Stayed for only 3 nights, wish i had stayed more. The rooms are incredibly clean. 4 to a room (in all rooms, I believe). The beds are comfy and as clean as my bed at home. It is obvious the rooms and communal areas are highly maintained and kept clean.Full size range of wetsuits to hire as well as soft top surfboards for beginners. They have a small amount of epoxy fish/hybrid boards which were more than enough to have some fun sessions on. If you are picky/want to surf Supertubos etc just bring your own board. Both beaches are only a 10~ minute walk. Perfect for going for a quick wave before breakfast/after dinner.The breakfast served every morning was beautiful; fresh coffee, fresh rolls with spreads and cereal. There is also a supermarket with every thing you keed only a 2-3 minute walk away. All rooms have private fridges too.Can’t wait to come back - thanks so much for an awesome, awesome stay.Tom",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,5

Vila Galé Albacora,mmassini,5,mmassiniwrote a review Apr 2013,"We have been staying at this hotel for several times: the location is great (quiet), staff is most friendly, the hotel is comfortable with nice swimmingpool and restaurant and it has an unique historical 'background' (small village where fishermen and their families lived who fished for the albacora tuna fish). The old, school, chapel and houses have been restored with good sense of cultural value. There is one thing you should know: because of the tide and the salt lakes, you frequently sense an intense smell of... mud. It can be so intense that you can not open your windows at that time.",Apr,2013,Apr 2013,2013-04-01,2013,4

Some free weights and a couple of benches and a cable machine as well as the normal assortment of cardio machines.The only thing letting it down slightly was location.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,greenstOat24,239,greenstOat24wrote a review May 2014,"I stayed 4 nights here, including the night of the UEFA Champions League final. It is well-located, though a little noisy on the back side, due to the proximity of a multi-lane freeway.The reception area is large, and extremely busy. One reason may be that free wifi connection is available there (oddly, not generally in the rooms themselves). It is a nice space for a coffee, with an outdoor balcony area for smokers.The room was a little disappointing. The carpet was a worn synthetic fibre, which was quite prickly to walk on in bare feet. No minibar, though that wasn't an issue for me. The bathroom was small, with a shower over the bath. The king size bed was very comfortable, though the pillows left a lot to be desired; a choice of either rock-hard, or ridiculously soft and unsupportive.The location is probably not too remote from the city centre during normal traffic, but it took more than a half hour to drive to St. George's castle on the eve of the football final.",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,4

Hotel Gat Rossio,Zebedee,12,Zebedeewrote a review Jan 2013,"I spent three nights in the Hotel Gat Rossio in Lisbon and will definitely recommend it to my friends.  It’s right in the centre, close to the shopping area.  The Aerobus to and from the airport stops about 200 metres away (Eur3.50 each way), Rossio Metro station is a similar distance and Rossio railway station is just across the road.The hotel décor is young, fresh and bright.  The rooms are small with funky furniture that is very functional (except for hanging trousers!).  The shower worked really well and there were nice toiletries plus a “hotel-style” hairdryer.  Everything was really clean.  The reception staff are friendly and helpful and there is a computer in the reception area for all to use free of charge (great for on-line flight check-ins).  The breakfast area has tables and padded benches – that doesn’t sound great, but in fact it’s really comfortable and, again, very practical.  Breakfast is buffet-style with the usual fruit and juice, bread/toast, rolls, boiled eggs, cold meat, cheese, pastries, cakes and coffee/tea etc. and, like everything else, it’s well laid out and appealing.The Gat Rossio is located on a narrow side street surrounded by restaurants.  My room was at the front of the hotel and I was glad to be able to close the shutters at night to block out whatever noise there was.

The staff were super helpful and friendly and the hotel is located in a perfect spot overlooking the beach and for watching the local surf. We looked forward to the breakfasts every day. Azeem’s omelettes were perfect. The menus between the hotel restaurant and the beach hut were great as were the weekly bbq’s and sunset DJ sets. The rooms are very well designed and cool even during hot weather. The surfing classes and the team providing them are excellent. There is plenty of space to relax and lounge inside or out peacefully at any time of the day. From start to finish we felt so welcome. We enjoyed our stay so much here we are already booked to return in 2020. If you are thinking of visiting Noah Surf House then seriously stop thinking and just reserve a room before they’re gone!,Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,5
Pestana Viking,Tevans,71,Tevanswrote a review Apr 2022,"Good value, clean and well run. All staff accommodating, friendly , hard working and helpful.Food:Breakfast is well organised, less busy prior to 9am.Lunch basics , week cooked and presented.Dinner ; this was more unpredictable. Seafood theme good, Italian Eve not so.A relaxed dining feel. Plates get cleared away as soon as you leave them unattended- leave clues you still want them.Day:Grounds well cared for and spacious. At this time of year no early reserved beds, so it was good to have a leisurely breakfast and then head to the pool. Pool clean , salt water. Beds towards end of garden / cliff lovely and wuiet , plenty of shade from trees also.Room: we had a room with kitchenette and although next to lift we actually found it quiet , facing road we got a the beautiful late afternoon sun on balcony. Fridge and microwave.Out and about : local restaurants good: tip book is you can as they get busy. Cliff walks great especially at start or end of day. Walk to town worth is , as are all the coves and small beaches.Downside : credit / debit cards. Whatever the reason more times than not, they are declined or yhe ‘net’ is problematic ( duty managers response when we complained- the response did not explained or resolve issue). Internet works , so it isn’t that. Many people resort to cash , but you can pay up at reception. An alternative is to arrange to have charges to room - but this entails €25 per person per day as an advance on card. This is then adjusted : however this would incur further exchange charges.All in all a good choice in a beautiful location. Lots of hills , slopes and steps to beaches.Unlike Britain Portugal is still very much a cash society in this area.",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,4

The hotel is new reorganized and rooms are nice (even if are small). In general i suggest this place for short stay and in period of No student party (festa das latas e queima das fitas) the risk is insomnia.

Natura Algarve Club,Alan K,11,Alan Kwrote a review Aug 2011,"Read the reviews on here before we went and this helped to manage our holiday expectations.So hope this helps you.Not a 5 star place but not paying 5 star prices.The appartments were clean and tidy. Kitchen dated but everything worked.Air con in the living room and in bedroom which was great.Kitchen - BasicBathroom - BasicLiving area - NiceBalcony - better than expected.Swimming pool was nice and if you could not get a sunbed there was lots of grass area to lay towels out.The staff were polite so our experience was different to the feedback given by others.Internet access so kids had daily fix of facebook.No noise really after midnight and staff make sure younger groups adhere to this. People do come home in early hours. They are quiet and this is managed by night staff.Food prices at pool bar were reasonable 5 euros for chessbuger and chips.Top of the road turn left 150 yards and on the right there is a supermarket.Top of road American Diner reasonably priced.Top of road and opposite was a takeaway which did kebabs, pizza, chips, burgers all resonably priced if that's what you want.Top of road turn left and 50 yards on the right is Annabels. Reasonably priced English restaurant that also did a good breakfast for between 2 and 3.5 euros according to choice.Strip was a 10 minute walk away.Old town 30 minutes further on than the strip. worth the walk. Long cue to get a taxi back so we walked.Best local beach left at top of the road, at roundabout turn left 20 minute walk in total. The one to the right was rocky in the water - This is a 15 minute walk..Zoo marine good for a day trip. Do shop about though before booking. Agent next to supermarket we found to be cheapest",Aug,2011,Aug 2011,2011-08-01,2011,4
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,indiannie10,26,indiannie10wrote a review Jun 2014,"I stayed here in Feb 2014 for a winter sun holiday. The food was served buffet style, as is often the case in similar hotels, but the hot food was hot and the cold food was cold, which is not always the case elsewhere. There was a good range of food, from lovely salads through nicely cooked main meals, to desserts and cheeses. My room was great - clean and spacious enough. I had a balcony looking over the pool, around which the hotel is built. The pool is nice, though no one was braving it at that time of year, though plenty were sitting out in the sun on the sunbeds. The weather was good and warm and I was almost tempted to try the pool but opted for the inside pool in the spa part of the hotel. Another day I had a massage in the spa at a reasonable price. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. There is little evening entertainment at that time of year, at least. Perhaps there is some in other seasons.The area is good for bird spotting on the salinas nearby. Because of local geography (Tavira is on a river whose mouth is sheltered by Tavira Island), you need to get a boat to the best beach, which is on the island. These run regularly and more so in summer months. It is only a short trip to this beautiful extensive beach.The town is quite old, and on both sides of the river. It is not very large and if you don't mind walking, you can stroll around taking in the historical sites, including the castle, the old bridge and the old fish market. There is a little train on wheels that you can take around the town if you don't want to walk. You can stay on for the full tour of about 45-60 minutes. The driver stops at picturesque points for photographs. Or you can hop on and off at places you want to see. There are cafes, bars and small shops of all kinds to browse.I'll be going again. I was only there for a week and it wasn't enough!",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,4

Pestana Viking,HappyVacation016,53,HappyVacation016wrote a review Feb 2018,"We went in the off season.  The hotel was quiet.  The spa facilities were nice.  The indoor pool with the waterfall looked great, but swimming, you kept bumping into the underwater pedestal that held the waterfall up.  The hot tub was only slightly hot, and the sauna just great.  The outdoor pool was not useable, it was too cold.  The grounds were lovely, great for strolling.  On sunny days, it is nice to sit on the lounges.  The breakfast buffet was included with our package.  Lot of selection, the usual cold cereal, variety of cold meat and cheese, bread, lots of seasonal fruit.  Sausages and scrambled eggs, baked beans.  However, the selection is the same every day.  Desk clerks were very helpful and personable.  I would recommend the hotel but in the off season there are very few restaurants close by.  You have to go to next town Armacao de Pera to get a good selection.",Feb,2018,Feb 2018,2018-02-01,2018,3

Our hosts, Marta and Iker are perfect hosts who give great attention to detail and they are so kind and friendly. Our stay was much more than just comfortable and welcoming - it actually felt like it was our home too!  Dexter and Dylan, the gorgeous setters, made up for us missing our own dogs and the shady, peaceful ambience of the garden was a delight. The meals were delicious - made with imagination, great skill and the best ingredients. We decided immediately to have dinner there each evening, outside on the pretty terrace. The menu was exciting and varied - Iker was more than happy to recommend and suggest which is so helpful when confronted with such a fabulous  choice! Marta and Iker are also great tour guides and sent us many links to interesting places that we would otherwise have missed. This is a beautiful part of Portugal and Casa do Cabeço is in an excellent, peaceful location within easy reach of famous cities and landmarks. We cannot recommend this very special place more highly and hope we can return one day.",Sep,2020,Sep 2020,2020-09-01,2020,2

I had a lovely balcony as long as i did not look down. It looked up the hill to the university and to the river off to the right. And over a big pile of rubble and crud. Some rooms overlook the river and pool. Not sure why they didnt put us in one of those rooms with a view. The hotel did not have many guests at that time.The rooms are very nice, clean, and comfortable. There was no furniture on the spacious balcony so we dragged chairs out from inside to enjoy our happy hour of local wine and olives.The pool is very nice and there are lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas.Breakfast buffet was nice.It was not a long walk to the university or riverfront but was not real scenic along the way.There is parking in an attached garage for a reasonable fee.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,4

Situated just outside the main town centre which is literally a 5 minute amble away,it has a small minimarket across the road and the first of many restaurants which lead into the town..We stayed in apartment 9 which is the basic self catering accommodation. It was immaculately clean with a well appointed kitchen with towels being changed every couple of days..We asked to have a look round the larger apartments which were even better than no.9 with fantastic views over the pool and garden area to the sea.The owners are lovely people and can't do enough to be of assistance at any time..It was our first time in Portugal and can't wait to book next year's holiday..here..",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,2
