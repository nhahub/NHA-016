Saccharum,Sonofmyparents,100,Sonofmyparentswrote a review Aug 2016,"It was our first trip to Madeira and thanks to Saccharum we have already started to miss it. The hotel is situated in a peaceful hamlet of Cahleta boasting with a private beach . The beach is a bit gray and stony but still safe to bathe thanks to the breakwaters . The lifeguard was very keen to save our lives but we gave him no chance. After a swim you can refresh yourself at the beach bar where  a poncha drink and a tasty nibble is available .The hotel room was very spacious and clean and all the bathroom facilities were of high standard. There was also a fridge, safe and a stove so if you were not happy with hotel meals you could cook something by yourself. We had a room in the furthest building on the 7th floor with very good sea view and far away from hotel noise. As an advantage two floors above us there was an indoor swimming pool which we used frequently. From the ninth floor terrace one could take a small stroll to the main sun bathing complex with outdoor swimming pool with a beautiful view of Atlantic Ocean and Cahleta marina.The pool bar served variety of good quality food.The main restaurants were situated on the second floor in the main building. One could have a meal on the nice terrace and enjoy  excellent views including Madeira sunset. So there was something good for your body and soul.The hotel staff was amazing; very polite and helpful- ready to sort out any problem you had.It is a pity that our stay was so short but we hope to be back in the future.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Vila Gale Collection Braga,Little_Lew,57,Little_Lewwrote a review Nov 2018,"I just stayed last night at this wonderful place,The rooms were large and gorgeous (I was in room 105), the staff was pleasant and helpful beyond belief and my breakfast was superb. My intuition is when they develop a larger reputation and following they will switch to buffet style; as it is currently the breakfast is ordered but the choices are extensive and there is no hesitation in giving more food, even urging food on you.Because of the building style, like a 15th century monastery the corridors are wide and long and not particularly well heated but the enclosed rooms, restaurant, bar, etc are quite comfortable.It is elegant placed in the center of the old Braga.There are only a couple of nits that could be fixed for it to be as close to perfect as ny commercial hotel can be.To be ecologically aware, they don't have a book about the hotel in the room with telephone numbers, etc and the phone has no markings. All this information is potentially available on the television. However my television had Cyrillic text and it took a technician to correct that and he could never find the hotel information with internal telephone numbers for room service or reception. The one time I did need something, I had to dress and walk down to the reception to get any response (which was quick.).The second issue was that I was parked in the secured back parking lot, inside a gate that was opened when I called the front desk on arrival.When I was leaving, there was no obvious way to open the gate on my own, no button on a stalk I could reach from my car, no pressure pad under the driveway and I had to call the front desk again. It was raining very, very hard and I wasn't about to get out and look around.The third and last was that, the room electricity is controlled by putting one's key  in a slot inside the door.So, when I was leaving the lights went out immediately and I had to fumble around in the total dark for both my suitcase and the door handle. (The corridor door is in an anteroom and there is no ambient light coming from windows.) Surely there could be a 10 second delay before the lights go out.All that being said, this is a wonderful place that I would recommend to anyone for the general quality, the decor, the excellence of staff and food and the location.",Nov,2018,Nov 2018,2018-11-01,2018,4

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",Lise_Messier,46,Lise_Messierwrote a review Oct 2017,Was lucky enough to experience this resort for my milestone birthday and I wanted to stay longer. This resort has it for everyone. It’s a big resort with different styles of accommodations. They have I think 11 restaurants to choose from. Never have I been disappointed with the food or service. The beach is easy access and you can walk for miles and miles. The service is top notch. The little town of Albufeira is 10 min by taxi for approx 15 euros. Thank you team Pine Cliffs.

Quinta do Mel,Pieter H,5,Pieter Hwrote a review May 2012,"Quinta do Mel is an extraordinary place for ultimate relaxation. The owners and people in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. Even on our last day we were able to keep our room till the evening- not having to worry about check out time.Every other day we had dinner here, superfresh fish or perfectly cooked meat with some lovely wines and for a good price. A couple of times we had some sangria; both the white and the red sangria were the best I ever had! Enjoying it outsideThe tea (made using the herbs from the garden- I recommend the rosemary tea :)) and cookies that they provide daily in your room in the evening (on the house) was a nice extra to look forward to.The beach Falesia was about a 20min walk away - past orange and olive trees near the hotel- and was very nice, and the beach was very empty (mid May) which was a pleasant surprise.If youre planning to go to the Algarve, this is a good option if youre not looking to get away from the buzz of the city and away from mass tourism.",May,2012,May 2012,2012-05-01,2012,5

When we arrived we were infomed that we would be staying in a members suite (very nice). The staff were all very helpfull and polite and the room spotless.We were on a BB basis and the first morning the breakfast was excellant as it was cooked fresh due to so few guests.But as the wk end approached it became buffet style and the food was luke warm and only fair.Another tip take your own pool towel as the charge is 10 euros per towel which with only a couple of days use i thought expensive Also the tourist train stops just across the road (very handy).Overall i would recommend to a friend.,Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,3

Luna Clube Oceano,MrsH1980,60,MrsH1980wrote a review Sep 2013,"We recently stayed at this hotel on a family holiday.Location is fantastic. It is around 5-10 mins to the beach. And is exactly half-way between the old town and the 'strip' with about a 15-20 walk to each (downhill walk to old town, uphill walk to strip).The hotel itself is very clean. Our room was a 1 bedroom apartment on the fourth floor. Pool view and you could see the sea as well. Rooms were very big with a bedroom, bathroom (bath & shower), kitchen, and living room/dining room. Kitchen was well equipped with cooker, hob, fridge, microwave & toaster. As other reviews have said, no electric kettle so you have to use the hob. One of the sockets in our kitchen didn't work so we had to move the toaster to the living room and couldn't use the microwave. This was too much of a big deal for us, but could have posed a problem for others.Huge balcony saw the sun for most of the day but the rooms still didn't get too hot. There is air-conditioning if you need it.Other reviews have criticised the pool bar for removing towels but we didn't experience this at all, perhaps it was because it was quieter when we were there. The guy who served us at the pool bar was pleasant and the food was pretty good.Both swimming pools (main pool and kids pool) were cold but were ok once you got in. Previous guests had left inflatable toys and rubber rings which our daughter loved. Showers at the pool weren't great.There was a few bars right next door to the hotel but most nights we would head to the beautiful old town. You can walk (downhill) in around 20 mins but it is a bit of a trek on the way home as its quite a steep hill. There is a tourist train that will bring you to/from the old town although it can take about 35/40 mins at night.Overall, a great location. Would suit couples, young families (due to lack of entertainment in the evening for older kids), and friends (willing to walk to the strip).",Sep,2013,Sep 2013,2013-09-01,2013,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,kathmcc,117,kathmccwrote a review Jul 2011,"We checked in at 11pm and after a nightcap returned to our room.  I was astonished to find the bed extremely lumpy on further inspection I found the mattress protector was flat in some parts and very lumpy (scrunched up) in others making for a strange looking bed!.  It looked like it had been washed at the wrong temperature?  I immediately rang reception and she asked me straight away if the problem was the topper. I was surprised that she was not shocked at my call.   She offered to let us move rooms but this was the last thing we wanted to do at 12.30 am.  I didn't want to cause a fuss and suggested that they just change the topper.   Over 45 minutes passed and my partner rang reception and asked why there was a delay.  Eventually a member of staff arrived with a full armoury of bedding (quilt/pillows/sheets/ pillow cases/quilst cover/vallance/topper and proceeded to mutter and moan, huff and puff her way through making the whole bed! I offered to help her (not a wise move) and also tried to explain we only wanted the topper changed!  She tutted and shook her hands at me, so we stood there like naughty children (I'm 40) and let her get on with it.  After another 15 minutes, she finally left.  After a long day of travelling we finally got to sleep at 2.30am.   We were only on holiday for 2 days so I wasn't very impressed to say the least.  The following day, I asked to speak with the Duty Manager, Nelson.  He was very apologetic and assured me that he would look into the matter and \"look after us\".   We heard nothing from Nelson.  The next day (our last) as we were checking out I asked to speak with him again as nothing had been done to compensate our unnecessary uncomfortable first night.  I waited at reception for nearly 1 hour, finally he arrived and said he had not had time to speak with his staff regarding the matter yet (26 hours later) and that he had not said anything about compensating our time.  He then informed me that he had sent something up to the room (two small bottles of Port which none of us drink and 4 custard cakes from breakfast) I later returned the wine and threw the cakes away.  I asked him why he had not looked into the matter earlier, he replied that he was thorough and like to hear both sides of the story!  I was insulted that he was suggesting that there was chance I was making this up! I informed him that I thought his treatment of us was both unprofessional and insulting.   This whole episode has left me with a very bad feeling towards the hotel.In general the rooms were clean and acceptable and the staff in the bar area and lobby were very friendly.  The hotel in parts could do with a bit of modernization.  There is a balcony outside the bar in reception which would be a lovely place to sit and have a drink but unfortunately it is full of pigeons and some of the furniture has pigeon droppings on them.  I feel this hotel is better suited to 3 star and not a 4 star establishment.Also a bit of advice on pickpockets.  I consider myself quite an experienced traveller.  The pick pocket problem is Lisbon in huge.  My Mother in Law was unfortunately a victim of this on the No 28 Tram.  Please take care, these gangs are very good at what they do.  Keep your bags in front of you and don't press the bell (as I did) when asked, this was their cue to pick her purse (they left it on the floor after they had took her notes out).  I googled it on my return and two of the actual people that were on the Tram are on You Tube, they have been doing this a while (one video is from 2007) so please be really careful.",Jul,2011,Jul 2011,2011-07-01,2011,1

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Swintooh,125,Swintoohwrote a review Jul 2018,"Stayed in June a couple of nights for a business conference. The positives are: distance from the airport, nice lobby and bar (watching football on a big screen), room and bathroom were always very clean. Not so good things: dated decor, small pool and no paddling pools for kids, average food (self service lunch) and being really in the middle of nowhere. The hotel has a tiny convenience store, no idea where the nearest larger shop is - nowhere in sight in the close vicinity of the hotel. The petrol station sort of nearby (5-10 mins walk) is where you can get some stuff. On the other hand taxis and uber are very cheap in Lisbon - so it could be a decent base for sightseeing.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,3

Rooms are huge and fully equipped for a self catering stay. Only thing missing was an oven. Cleaned daily with new towels. Everything worked as it should.Couple of minor things.....still refurbing so pretty noisey....stay away from level 1. Staff rooms are there for the cleaners and it was super noisey every morning.....you have to leave a deposit for the TV and air con remote.....water goes cold after 2 showers.Things to warn you, pool is freezing....loads of free sunbeds in May.....can't check in until 14.00ish.....they do serve snacks at the bar and breakfast that we wasn't told about.....walk a bit further to the bigger supermarket as it is a lot cheaper......walk to old town and taxi back for 5 euros (cardiac hill), you will see what I mean.....no onsite shop.We had a great time and will be returning at some point.

It's right at the center of the city center! We always pass by the hotel on our way from one spots to the other, so we got to go back to our room to refresh a little before heading out again. The room itself is clean and spacious with everything you need. I especially like the balcony! There elevator in the building so you don't need to worry about carrying the luggage up. The entrance gate downstairs will be closed after 9pm and you need a code to get in, which makes you feel safe. Will definitely return next time I'm in Lisbon.",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,AEH,45,AEHwrote a review Jul 2016,"Tivoli is a Portuguese chain of resorts. Front desk staff was very welcoming, kind and helpful. Rooms are old and dated, but that is what you should expect anywhere in Europe - it was actually very cute and charming! Room was very clean. We had a breakfast-included room, and breakfast selection was decent. The best part of this hotel is the pool area. The pool sits on top of a small cliff that you can walk down to the beach. It is absolutely stunning. The pool is large and not very busy, and the pool area has a ton of sun chairs. You don't have to wake up at 7 AM to go and claim a chair - it's decently relaxed although it did fill up. There's a lunch restaurant right beside the pool that was very good and offered a good variety of food (salads, burgers, sandwiches, fish, etc). I heard people complaining about the pool being too cold, but I found the cold water perfect as it hits 35-40 degrees there in the summertime. Beach is small but incredibly beautiful, and you have to walk/hike down a few flights of steps to get to it. There wasn't ever anyone on the beach when we were there, which was nice - it was extremely private. They had a shuttle service to Carvoeiro Beach although we didn't use it. There's a small town about 500 metres down the road - a 5 minute walk - with a ton of restaurants and some shops. All in all a beautiful hotel that I can't wait to get back to!",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,golden c,36,golden cwrote a review Jul 2016,"Came from USA to a \"Retire in Portugal\" conference (which turned out to be a marketeer's wet dream).  The weekend was mobbed, and it seemed as if the city folk from Lisbon, came here, mostly for the pool  and the mind-boggling free breakfast they include in the price.  For a sea view, an extra $20.  Would recommend that, as otherwise, it's the parking lot.Pros:  Great, crisp, fresh clean sheets!  Nice view (go higher for less noise from the family pool).  Again, that breakfast that was free is off the charts.  (fresh foods, no GMOs here, mostly.)  In a quiet part of town, but further to walk to the Centro.Cons:  the \"Free\" wifi is located in the Lobby, and is very minimal (ie, no photos download into your emai, no streaming, no gifs).  We talked to the staff as our advertisement said \"free wifi in room\".  They said, yes it is free, IF YOU APPLY FOR A DISCOVERY CARD.  Whut??  So, yea, no thanks.  So we paid $15/day for wifi in the room, which was as the one in the Lobby, no streaming, no photos etc, AND only worked 50% of the time.  So don't come here if you are doing business.  Also, the maids cut off the A/C after they clean.  So you come back to a hot box, every time, lol.  Except for our initial nice check lady, the rest of the staff was abrupt and tired and not happy campers.

SANA Capitol Hotel,Camper14976,11,Camper14976wrote a review Jul 2003,"This hotel was really a great dissapointment. First of all the taxi driver couldn't even find it. Then it appeared - dark, dusty building close to a huge half finished building (which will be another hotel in the nearest future). From the windows you could look into eyes of the builders. We couldn't change the hotel because it has been booked and already paid by our travel agency. Rooms: a disaster - I got one without windows in the bathroom and the smell from the bathroom made me almost faint when I entered the room. Air conditioning was not working at all so I had to keep windows open because of smell and hot. But then constant noise from the streets kept me awake all night. Here I must admit staff turned to be quite helpful, they moved me into another room, this time with windows in the bathroom and air conditioning working. Again I couldn't turn it on because it was too noisy but at least the smell disappeared so I could close the windows. If there is anybody who would like to see the photos I took there which are quite different from what you can find on their www page, I can mail them.",Jul,2003,Jul 2003,2003-07-01,2003,1

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Andrew,0,Andrewwrote a review Apr 2019,The auguries for our short stay were not good: arrival was delayed by two days due to high winds at Funchal Airport. Our decision as to whether to cancel altogether was made by the hotel Manager's kind agreement to roll forward our booking. As soon as we walked through the door we knew our troubles were over.  The warm and courteous reception was echoed  throughout our stay.  The superb service and food at breakfasts were just slightly marred by lukewarm buffet  and we had to call for the services of microwave! Our Classic room was  very well appointed  with wonderful sea views but perhaps a little too much information clutter (could you simplify this?) The gardens are a wonder in themselves.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Perry101,34,Perry101wrote a review Jul 2019,"Had a wonderful short break at this hotel. Staff were all friendly and attentive. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice. It did get very busy after 9am, but staff worked hard to make sure this wasn’t a problem. Pool area clean and spacious with plenty of sun loungers. Ideally located for both the lovely beach and marina. Plenty of good restaurants locally to choose from. The only negative was the treatment in the spa. Unfortunately this probably has to be the worst full body massage I’ve ever received. Perhaps I had been squeezed in and the therapist wasn’t very happy about it, and this showed throughout the treatment, and the hour treatment was 40/45 mins max. In hindsight, I should have said something at the time. The only reason why I didn’t give the full 5 stars.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4
Natura Algarve Club,Frances C,36,Frances Cwrote a review Oct 2018,Just had a 5 day break here - my first time and my daughters second time. Lovely large apartment with long balcony - comfortable beds and well equipped kitchen. Reception staff very friendly and the pool area was good with comfy beds. A good location just down a quiet street but still within easy walking distance of local bars and restaurants - we found 2 really good ones:Agapito and Eduardos further up the main road. Both friendly with excellent food! Also enjoyed visiting The Old Town bar with their karaoke nights - really good!,Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,5
Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,KateSoul,1,KateSoulwrote a review May 2018,Can't say anything negative about this hotel. Bed is super comfortable. Sea view room was stunning. The bathroom setup is interesting (not). We could see eachother from the toilet to the bed trough a clear curtain. But that was the only thing!Breakfast was amazing with so many choices available and the indoor pool was relaxing at night.A special greeting to the beard man Milton who planned basically all our São Miguel's trip with super joy and laughs.The bar was delightful with tasty cocktails ( thanks Hugo! ) and chill music.Certainly a place to come back!!!,May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Simon M,18,Simon Mwrote a review Oct 2014,"This was our first stay in this hotel.  We arrived to be greeted warmly at reception and shown our room.  The rooms are spacious with excellent comfortable beds.  We stayed in a junior suite for half of the holiday and this was an excellent upgrade.  Breakfast is first class, anyone that complains about this is being very unreasonable.  There is a quality fruit, meat, cheese selection with excellent additional options of omelette and even British breakfasts for those that cannot leave the UK without having beans, sausage and bacon.  Staff are great around the hotel and the bar is very reasonable for a 5 star when compared to other resorts.  The pool is fantastic with excellent views out to sea.  The pirate ship is excellent for children and you are minutes away from the Marina (bit of a tourist trap).  You will find better and more affordable restaurants away from that area.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4

Excellent service from the staff, a really comfortable room and splendid food and wine.  What's not to like.The view over the town was interesting and there was no real traffic noise.  Beds were comfortable and there were a useful table and chairs in the room as well as the balcony.  A kettle is not supplied automatically but the housekeeper produced one with plenty of tea and coffee when asked.The buffet for the party was outstanding - seafood, meats, soup, hot choices and some very nice desserts, including cakes.The breakfast was equally high quality with a wide selection of juices, hot and cold choices of food and delicious breads and rolls.",Dec,2014,Dec 2014,2014-12-01,2014,5
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,amlazyAlabama,39,amlazyAlabamawrote a review Apr 2023,This was a large 3 star hotel in a great city location. There were several tour groups staying there during our visit. Receptionist had more than they could handle so a few minutes wait. We opted for a city view since we were only there for 1 night. It was loud but traffic not bad after 9pm.  Breakfast was adequate. There was a charge for parking which was understandable but also to use safe which seemed odd. Good place to stay if price is right and for a central location,Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,4

They have activities and a spa, parking garage. There is typically a fee for the parking garage, but since we arrive so late, it was complimentary. 85 Euros included breakfast for us both. The breakfast is buffet style with plenty of choices for all. If it is busy you may have to stand in line for the cook to order pancakes or omelets.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4
Eurostars Porto Douro,Jose,0,Josewrote a review Dec 2024,"We were so excited when we got to our hotel. It's beautiful and well designed. The staff seemed friendly. They even called our room after we settled in to see how it's going. That was nice. Especially since they claim to be 4 star hotel. When it turned for the worse was when we asked them to arrange a taxi for us. We needed to be picked up at 730am so we can meet for our tour. We booked a $250 tour of Douro Wine Valley. So we go outside to meet our taxi and no taxi. Some man was outside waiting so we thought he must be waiting for a taxi. A few minutes later a male staff member of the hotel came out and asked us if we were waiting for a taxi. We said yes, and he points to the man. Ok, where is the taxi that is marked? Apparently this hotel uses some driver service instead of providing us with a Taxi which we had asked. So we go into an unmarked car. My 6 year old daughter and my wife as well.  We tell him we are going to Lapa Church. He said ok. My wife has Google maps up with love directions and it said 12 minutes. The driver goes in the wrong direction. Then he keeps going and ends up on the freeway during some serious rush hour. My wife is like where the hell is he taking us. Our time keeps going up and we are completely in the wrong direction. We needed to be at our tour 815am. We told the driver Lapa Church, he said yes. We told him he's going in the wrong direction and he says he doesn't speak English. Something clicks and then he starts taking crazy side streets and up and down and bumpy roads. My wife and daughter getting car sick. Which my daughter ended up puking in the backseat. Which my wife caught in my daughter's jacket. We get to our tour late. A 40 minute ride in the wrong direction for a trip that should of taken 12 minutes. We told the tour guy my wife is sick and so is my daughter so we can't make it. After that nonsense, we walk 40 minutes back to our hotel. Get to our hotel and informed who we didn't know at the time was the manager everything that happened and went wrong. Instead of showing any kind of sympathy, all she did was defend the driver and say the roads are busy. Not listening to us as we told her we were using Google maps driving directions live and he went the wrong way. She said it must of been a misunderstanding and he was giving us a tour. What tour? We specifically said we need a ride to the church to catch out tour. So ridiculous. No sympathy, just pointing the finger at us even though they messed up. When someone asks for a taxi, get them a taxi and not some unmarked driver who doesn't use GPS. We confront the staff members who messed up our taxi and asked who the manager was and they said the lady who was unsympathetic. How can that be a manager of a 4 star hotel. The next day, that manager asked to speak to my wife and asked what she can do better if this happens again? Really, you gonna ask us what she should do differently next time. Get some sympathy. Offer some sort of goodwill gesture. We didn't ask for a them to help us get to the train station. We found out Uber was there. Took that, and got to the train station like it said we would. Would I stay there again if we go back to Porto? Not sure, loved the hotel and how comfortable and clean it was. It was the staff and management that made it suck and for us to give it a 1 Star",Dec,2024,Dec 2024,2024-12-01,2024,2

This was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the beautiful Douro Valley. I called the hotel once we arrived at the train station and they promptly sent a taxi to pick us up. We had a great view of the Douro and it was wonderful to sit outside and listen to all the birds. The staff couldn't have been more attentive. Every person who worked there always spoke to us and made us feel right at home. We were welcomed upon check-in and someone escorted us to our room. We enjoyed the afternoon wine tasting and had great breakfasts and dinners with wonderful servers. I went for a short hike through the vineyards and enjoyed a massage before we left. This is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy the beauty of the Douro.,Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,5

The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy.If you want breakfast make sure you get there early as the hot stuff will be gone quick! The meal that was provided for 10 euros was pretty good; it was a 3 course meal, bargain!The only problem I had was the wifi on floor 2 didn't work which meant we had to go downstairs to use it.

Sofa bed turned out to be a bit uncomfortable, but staff were excellent and put proper beds in the room for us immediately. Staff were also very helpful with information about sightseeing and getting around.The room was spotless and was cleaned every day. Loved the pool, also very clean. The hotel was a good size, not too big,making it easy to use pool,internet  and drink machine facilities.  Breakfast buffet had a very good selection to choose from, and again staff were very pleasant and helpful, despite being very busy on one of the mornings.We liked the position of the hotel, on a quiet street, near to a metro station. It was a walk of around 15 minutes to the center, ( uphill on the way back ) which was fine by us, but otherwise the metro was a few minutes walk away. We used the metro and train to go to Estoril and we were amazed at how cheap and easy it was to use! There is a small shop nearby which was handy.Checking out was quick and easy as well, we got a wake-up call and a taxi ordered for us as we requested.We would thoughly recommend this hotel as being excellent value for money with very good service and facilities.
