Vila Gale Collection Braga,Tula T. G.,8,Tula T. G.wrote a review Oct 2024,"I have no words to describe the experience of staying in this hotel. The perfect blend of the new with the traditional and historical.Very comfortable room, complete, with various amenities, we were received with a tray of strawberries wrapped in chocolate, with a bottle of rosé wine in the bucket with ice...All extremely friendly and attentive staff. The location is perfect. We got close to absolutely everything. And Braga is a very welcoming and charming city, it looks like it came out of a Disney movie.The hotel is a unique and unforgettable experience!",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,5

Saccharum,Claus500,6,Claus500wrote a review Jan 2016,WE ( My son and his father ) are currently in the saccharum Hotel . Bespite the fact that this IS a New Hotel with Nice rooms etc the internal rules of the Hotel Management are far from Customer friendly  if you Travel with a Child : children under 16  years are not allowed to get into the only heated indoor Pool . In Dezember with Wind and rain outside this is a Desaster .On top everybody has to pay 20 Euro per Day per Person for using the spa Area .All in all this IS in My opinion not Customer oriented .,Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,2
Hotel Madeira,bowdensrus_uk,54,bowdensrus_ukwrote a review Nov 2012,"We stayed at this hotel last year and really liked it so decided to go back this year. Last year we had a room with a balcony but found it almost impossible to sit on it, it was so tiny so we decided not to pay extra for one this time. We had a corner room on the second floor which looked over the park and down the road to the sea front. There were windows on both sides of the corner and a small table and two chairs where we could sit and read our books and watch the rain pouring down. We needed the air conditioning on most nights and it was very quiet and you don't pay extra for it. The windows have blackout linings under the curtains so the light doesn't wake you up and there is very little outside noise. The downstairs bar is very good for coffee with very reasonable prices. We found all the staff polite and helpful. Everyone mentions the dull breakfasts which were still just as dull but you do get what you pay for and the central location and comfortable beds more than make up for the lack of a resort hotel type breakfast. Part of the sea front promenade is cordoned off while a new cruise ship dock is being constructed and we were a bit disappointed not to be able to walk all the way along the front. The hotel is about 10mins walk to the cable car which goes up to Monte. This is more expensive than the bus but the views are wonderful. Try to avoid going when the cruise ships are disgorging their passengers as there can be long queues. The main bus station is also near the cable car. Most of the restaurants seem to be good quality and I have reviewed some of these seperately. Yes it does rain sometimes but the people who live in Funchal are rightly proud of their little city and are very helpful to the slightly disorientated tourist. A word of warning. Don't hover on the pavement near one of the numerous zebra crossings unless you mean to cross the road. The very polite drivers will stop and wait for you to cross and I always felt obliged to do so although usually I had only stopped to admire a building and didn't want to be on the other side of the road!",Nov,2012,Nov 2012,2012-11-01,2012,4

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,Snargater,86,Snargaterwrote a review Nov 2012,"What did I like most about this hotel?  It's hard to choose really between the amazing sea view from our room which almost jutted out over the cliff edge and the fantastic breakfast buffet with the best ever fresh fruit choice.  Or the wonderful restaurant with its limited but high quality a la carte dining.  Or maybe the the friendly and genuine staff.  Then again how about the lovely outdoor pool and chromotherapy indoor heated pool?  And ofcourse the lovely bar and numerous sitting out spaces to chill and relax.  Forget the 5* hotels in Funchal - we did both in our trip but this was our favourite by a long way.  If you're going to Madeira, book here.",Nov,2012,Nov 2012,2012-11-01,2012,5

Hotel Cristal Porto,Victor C,3,Victor Cwrote a review Aug 2018,"Had a problem with my room (was no clean) and they said that it was only \"my appreciation\", since (for them) the room was clean. After a few hours, they changed the room past 2 am... At the end of my stay, I sent them an e-mail just informing of my appreciation of the hotel, and (in my opinion) what they needed to do to improve in those cases (since it happened to me before in other hotels and the answers from the other places was much better). The reply I got from them was even worse compared to what happened before, almost accusing a customer of doing a false statement and defending what their employees did and the \"policies\" of the hotel.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,2

The rooms were quite large with fabulous views of the pool, lawn and ocean. So many places to chill out so if you get bored at the beach, you can relax on one of the many lawns scattered with lawn chairs or one of the few pools. The spa was lovely and I got a 90 minute massage which was excellent.  Best place to end the day is at the champagne bar where you can watch the sunset over the pine cliffs! Will definitely return here with my hubby.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,5

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,World_Traveler-RM,5,World_Traveler-RMwrote a review Jan 2014,"The ride was ok, but the airline lost my luggage at the Amsterdam airport.  They did deliver it the next day.  At the check in, the lady was very nice and offered me a deal on an executive room.  The room was very nice, had a nice bath tub, had some English Tv channels, the internet worked okay.  The manager seemed a little nervous, but tried to be helpful, when I complained about the shower temp being too low.  Had a nice visit to the castle on the hill near the coast.  The traffic wasn't too bad.  Nice out in the country.  The hotel charges a fortune if you want something scanned on to your E-mail.  The area seemed nice enough, but you'd have to travel aways to get things.I ended up having to see our Embassy.  The country of Portugal for some reason wouldn't let me leave because of where I am a contracted worker at, for the USA Government.  The Embassy made arrangements to get me out of the country.  It's best not to volunteer info on where you're going.  Have a good and safe trip!Rick MBagram / Kabul, Afganistan",Jan,2014,Jan 2014,2014-01-01,2014,3

Luna Clube Oceano,LMR610,114,LMR610wrote a review Jun 2007,"My friend and i shared a studio apartment in Clube Oceano June 2007.  We had a ground floor apartment which had perfect access to the pool via a few steps.Apartment itself was large, spaceous, clean and pretty well stocked (except for only having 1 very flat pillow and no iron).  They were cleaned every other day.  There was a lack of wardrobe space but it was fine.  In general i thought it was a nice apartment. Good block out curtins to blockout the light and i cant say i found it noisy even though we were on the ground floor.Staff were also pretty helpful and informative.There is a little mini market 2 mins away where you can get things for the morning such as rolls,yoghurts, water etc.The apartments are situated about 20 min walk to the old town and strip.  We didnt walk it but get a taxi instead.  This was 4 euro plus a euro to the hotel for making the call!!!   The only thing was a shortage of taxis at the busy time of 8pm ish.  One night they could not get us a cab but told us there was a bus stop literally at the top of the road which brings you to the old twon for 1 euro!! It seems to be at about 10 past the hour i.e we got the 8.10pm bus most evenings.We both prefered the atmosphere of the old town. The Bank restaurant is a must... lovely menu, lots of variety and excellent food. Ate here twice.  Across from that is a steakhouse - cant remember the name but i would recommend it also.  In the strip we ate at wild and co which again was very nice and would recommend it. Also definately try the Green wine - its yum!!! its available in all restaurants.While n albufaira we went to the Zoomarine.  It was ok but nothing extraordinary (kids would love it). We also did a cruise which i would recommend.  Went to a gypsy market which is held on a wednesday. Dont bother its full of crap!!! Stoped off at Villamoura marina which was nice but didnt get to spend a lot of time there.Overall i was impressed with the apartments and enjoyed my week in albfaira but a week is definately enough... another week and i would have been bored i think.... enjoy....",Jun,2007,Jun 2007,2007-06-01,2007,4
Hyatt Regency Lisbon,GRab22,1,GRab22wrote a review Sep 2024,"Not worth the 340 euro price tag! They charge 30 euros per extra person per night (in the wife!) and then an extra 15 euros for the pool. The breakfast is far from tasty and the windows cannot be opened as the noise level outside is simply too much. I cannot believe they charge so much and give so little in return. No fridge in the rooms, probably to ensure you don’t bring in your own food and purchase theirs. Just feels like they’re trying to charge you money wherever they can.",Sep,2024,Sep 2024,2024-09-01,2024,1
Independente Principe Real,marmosselgonzalez,1,marmosselgonzalezwrote a review Jul 2016,"The first positive thing we noticed was the price. Knowing that we were a group of young people, who wanted to save as much money as we could, The Independente Hostel & Suites suited perfectly our budget.What we didn't expect was how excellent the localization was. Just in front of one of the most emblematic miradouro of the city, the wide windows reveled the spectacular views of Lisbon. It is also surrounded by many streets full with nice restaurants of local food.Going on to the rooms, we were impressed by their pleasant decoration and its welcoming atmosphere. All this summed to an inviting common Lounge, composed by a kitchen and a living room.On the other hand, the service was excellent, always available and understanding. We can't forget to mention the activities organized by the Hostel, such as the Bike tour given by Verena Wilder. She leaded us in an interactive and enjoyable journey to Belem which gave us a new and different perspective of the city. Our guide proved to be very helpful and well-mannered, as well as efficient when one of our friend hurt themselves accidentally. We really valued her care.Only inconvenient, the restaurant didn't offer the quality (and quantity) it's price should give.Otherwise, The Independente Hostel & Suites is an excellent place to stay in Lisbon, and I truly recommended to groups of friends who look or a nice and affordable establishment.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4

I had not requested a room for a disabled person, so the email was the only way they knew my needs. So, thank you so much. The furnishings and sanitaryware were clean and in first class condition. The fridge and safe did not work and a Maintenance man came and changed the fridge and we worked out the safe configurations. So, again, thank you for your prompt assistance. We were halfboard and the breakfast buffet was excellent with a good selection including full English. The evening meals could have been better with more variety of potato dishes instead of only chips which it was on both the evenings we were staying. The desserts did not look very appetising either.

The room was in the older part of the building - was on a smaller side but perfectly comfortable. Slightly irritating air conditioning unit noise from outside, at some times of the day. The breakfast was good with adequately varied dishes. We had a Sunday champagne buffet which was good fun, but, we did think that the food was bordering on average.

Bathrooms in the room are not the traditional type and shower area opens directly to the room which offers little privacy. I was with my son so it was a bit inconvenient. Nothing though that would make me not come back again.There’s a nice pool area on top, with chairs and tables where you can have a snack or a drink.

On the pricer side of hotels, the suite we stayed in was beautiful and had a balcony and outdoor hot tub. We enjoyed the outdoor space. The bathroom is a glass cube in the middle of the room and the ceilings were very high. The staff were very helpful with any inquiries we had and made our dinner reservations for us 2 or the 3 nights we stayed.  If we needed something in our room a quick phone call and it was there. The included breakfast buffet had plenty of delicious food and an a la carte menu if you preferred. We also enjoyed some great cocktails in the bistro/bar one evening. My only negative would be the lighting in the bathroom was a little dim and not enough counter space.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,mugearsuk,132,mugearsukwrote a review Jun 2018,"This hotel could be a genuine 5 star hotel (by British standards and not the lowered Southern European standards, where it seems that you should always automatically remove a star from any hotel’s rating if based in Southern or Eastern Europe - sorry). Without sounding like a snob (but completely aware I sound like a snob), real 5 star hotels welcome you upon arrival, take your bags, take you to your room, serve you drinks at the pool side, offer (and make) your coffee at breakfast and certainly do NOT make you collect your pool towels and impose a €50 charge if towels aren’t returned after use. My recommendation is that the management visit a few REAL 5 star hotels as the Crowne Plaza is clearly equipped and capable of being a real 5 star if it really wants to be (as the facilities and rooms are superb). Try London, Paris, Miami or Dubai. I’d be happy to join and make notes.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,4

Hotel Gat Rossio,Tour-de-Blundell,74,Tour-de-Blundellwrote a review Dec 2018,"Ideally located just off Rossio square the Gat hotel was our base for two nights.. Close to two metro stations, so about 30 mins away from the airport, this hotel was just perfect for our stay. The room we had was clean, modern and bight as it had several floor length windows with Juliet balconies. The shower was fab, piping hot water after visiting the sights.The included breakfast was comprehensive; Egg boiler, Espresso machine and freshly squeezed oranges. No tea or coffee in the room but there is a machine in the common room near the open air decking on floor 1. The original staircase runs up through the hotel, an interesting feature. Staff were very friendly and highly informative and helpful when we were asking about tour buses. They had suggested one that we hadn’t thought of which worked out perfect for us…So all in all a great place stay and will certainly be booking in here when we return.. hopefully in the not too distant future",Dec,2018,Dec 2018,2018-12-01,2018,5

We stayed 11 days in Deluxe Grey during the month of January/2025 and the stay was very pleasant. The hosts are very attentive and polite. The photos on the site are very true to the conditions of the property (which are impeccable), and the equipment is new, modern and efficient. The location is very central and close to the Forum (shopping), to restaurants, small markets, cafes, laundry, practically everything you need in a short season.

Itâ€™s located a few minutes away from an amazing supermarket and not far from the town centre, literally 5 mins in a rental car or taxi. The staff know about the local surf spots and aregenerally really helpful. Thereâ€™s a lovely poolside bar. We stayed in a large twin room with a balcony. Showers are good and always hot. I wouldnâ€™t hesitate recommending this place. Go for it!",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,5

Ocean Gardens,ianbosher,10,ianbosherwrote a review Sep 2016,"Super hotel for a restful week away for my wife and I. Spotlessly clean everywhere and friendly staff, especially the waiters in the restaurant who have a great sense of humour! A fairly small hotel with great views all round towards Funchal. Nice pool. Good breakfast. Away from the Town and there are no footpaths on the narrow winding roads but the hotel runs a courtesy bus and the local bus stops outside. The only negative comment is the noise of the occasional passing traffic as the road rubs right by the front of the hotel, is steep and has several bends. Noisy mopeds are still fashionable in Madeira. Otherwise super, recommended although perhaps not for families. We went during school term so not many children expected but there were none and most guests were of retirement age. Excellent for a rest in the sun (29 degrees end of September).",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4
Casa da Tita,Jacob554,3,Jacob554wrote a review Mar 2018,"We stayed at Casa da Tita whilst waiting to make the house we bought in the village habitable. The rooms are beautiful, in fact the whole of Casa da Tita is very tastefully renovated and the accommodation bordering on the luxurious. Our host Miguel anf his father waited for us until the early hours of the morning because a delayed flight and greeted us with home made wine and cake. Miguel our host, speaks fluent English and is incredibly helpful on all fronts. And value for money on a par with the best I have experienced. We were blown away by Miguel and his family's hospitality and we look forward to have them as neighbours and friends in Nave do Barao.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,5

It was a very modern and clean hotel less than 5 minutes away from the Dom Luis Bridge and the riverside area with many restaurants. Our room was very comfortable and we were provided with sufficient toiletries. The small balcony we had was also a nice touch, as we were able to relax on it and look out onto the river. We were also able to do a fairly long jog along the river, which was a beautiful and a great way to see this part of the city.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,4

Friendly, competent staff, a nice breakfast room with great room service and, rare for Lisbon, a lovely garden and pool.  Best of all were the spacious accomodations.  We rented the 3 bedroom suite which included a huge living room with dining area, full size kitchen and 3 full bathrooms and a half bath. It was a bargain considering the space.  Everything was very clean and I really can't say enough pleasant things about this property!",Nov,2007,Nov 2007,2007-11-01,2007,5

My complain is the walls are so thin, I could hear next door, especially the toilet flushing, shower running, people outside in the hall way. There are a few parking spaces in front of the hotel, but they were reserved for a large tour bus the day we were there, luckily we were able to find some free parking up the street. If you have ear plugs, that's very useful.",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,3
HF Fenix Lisboa,BarberC,15,BarberCwrote a review Nov 2012,"Just returned from a 2 night break here, seeing the sights. Hotel lobby area clean and comfortable, some reception staff helpful, others not. Our double room overlooked the roundabout at the front and was TINY! The smallest double I've ever been allocated - not even space for a dressing table at which to put on make up - had to do that in the bathroom. We took travel kettle as no tea making facilities. Location good for getting into lisbon. Airport bus stop was hard to find - its on the road that exits the roundabout directly opposite the hotel (right over the other side). Breakfast was good and we appreciated the free wifi but unlikely to stay here again as room not up to 4 star standard.",Nov,2012,Nov 2012,2012-11-01,2012,3

HF Fenix Lisboa,Manal Shihab,51,Manal Shihabwrote a review Nov 2017,"We stayed at HF Fenix Lisboa for 7 nights during November and it was a very pleasant and convenient stay. The location of the hotel is right next to the metro station and right next to the first stop of the Hop-on Hop-off buses. Marques de Pombal is the best location to stay at when you are in Lisbon because it is just a 10 to 15 minutes walk to the city center and to the lively neighborhood of Rossio square. The hotel itself is clean and the staff are very welcoming. However, room service skipped cleaning our room during two days of our stay, but they were so quick to provide the necessary toiletries when asked. Breakfast was rich and the staff had a very cheerful manager who welcomes you with a huge smile. Even the people at the desk were so helpful and they guided us through the city. I really recommend this hotel.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,4

Hotel Fátima,Nat255068,69,Nat255068wrote a review Oct 2011,Stayed there in September as part of a Trafalgar Tour.  it's the closest hotel to the shrine - just across the road in fact.  The rooms are adequate and the meals are passable.  All in all it doesn't make the four star rating.  It's purpose is to accommodate those wishing to visit the shrine which seems to be the onluy 'attraction in town.  A bit like Lourdes but I should add this hotel is way above the vast majority of hotels found there.,Oct,2011,Oct 2011,2011-10-01,2011,4
