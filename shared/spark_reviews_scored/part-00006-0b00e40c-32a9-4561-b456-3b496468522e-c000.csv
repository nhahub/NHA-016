Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Chaz-b98,173,Chaz-b98wrote a review Oct 2013,"Stopped for a week in Sept. Very comfortable, spotlessly clean and all mod cons, including a range of sat, TV channels, and well appointed kitchen area.. Staff helpful and friendly.The outdoor areas were again spotlessly clean, and plenty of sun loungers by the pools.Although I'm now going to be picky.If you are billed as a 4 star spa hotel, I would expect bathrobes in the bedrooms.It seemed to take forever for the water to heat up for a shower, and there was not temperature regulator, so it changed from cold to hot, then back to cold.Towels were only changed twice a week, but for a charge would be done more frequently.The hydrotherapy pools were only on for set periods during the day & turned off at 5.30pm.The restaurant only served what I would term bar food, which although was very good, is not really 4 star.Neither of the outdoor pools were heated, which made them very uncomfortable, even when the sun had been on them all day.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,2
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,G7SRE,0,G7SREwrote a review Sep 2019,"Lovely 4* i would say hotel,spacious lovely and clean ,hotel has 5 lifts 10 floors rooms are lovely and big clean with everything you would need,towels tea coffee making facilities TV etc and a safe to use free of charge with rooms being regularly cleaned.The food a lot of choice but some times warm or vegetables under cooked and hard.the hotel had a snack bar for sandwiches and an Italian snack bar making pizzas burgers hot dogs etc all in all a decent selection all of the time.My only criticism was the all inclusive usage of all the bars ends at 23.00 hrs in all the bars,however after that you were charged for your drinks .the all inclusive part you got local spirits but after 23.00 you got the real thing ie Smirnoff etc but in some cases this was not the case but it was mostly local spirits.All in all a really nice hotel average food and drink was not immensely disappointing would recommend to family's their is a kids club the entertainment apart from the live musicians were terrible but apart from that it was a nice break away.Would go back but i think in my experience never go to the same place twice.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4
Hotel Madeira,karen245,40,karen245wrote a review Jan 2014,"I stayed in this city-centre hotel between 27th Dec and 3rd Jan 2014 for the Christmas - New Year celebrations in Funchal. The hotel is right in the heart of the city and about 2 mins walk from the main street and the very posh Ritz cafe.It's a 60s hotel and is cosy, friendly and very Madeiran. It's spotlessly clean and very homely. It's not swish and modern but that didn't matter at all. In fact, I really liked the lovely retro feel of the place.The breakfast was good ... a choice of eggs, yoghurt, breads and cheese as well as ham and fruit.I've previously stayed in 4-star hotels in the hotel zone and the experience of this modest town centre hotel made me realise that swanky, spacious 4-stars aren't really my cup of tea.The hotel also offers free wifi and very helpful reception staff.Highly recommended if you want an authentic Madeiran experience. It was wonderful being able to step out of my hotel and immediately be in the town with all the wonderful festive on-street entertainment (dancers, brass bands, winter market, chestnut sellers and festive lights). Also, all the concert venues are within walking distance, so no expensive or inconvenient taxis needed at all.",Jan,2014,Jan 2014,2014-01-01,2014,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Ronn,0,Ronnwrote a review Apr 2025,"We read up the reviews for Jupiter and seeing all the positive reviews made us book it. We went in April 2025 with family and friends. The check in was slow and laborious, one room was ready and the other one wasn't, but thankfully they got the other room ready in a couple of hours.  The baggage staff were courteous and efficient. Brought up the bags in a jiffy and helped us put in the room. 5 stars from them.The weather wasn't the best for the first couple of days and we felt the hotel really lacks variety when the weather is not warm enough to use the pools. The evening entertainment was a bit monotonous as it was different types of dances by the same people. 5 stars for effort from the team but unfortunately variety is what was need which they lacked. Perhaps the hotel should look at getting a magician or juggler or fire act to change it up! Mini disco was average and wasn't really engaging for the kids as compared to some of the other hotels we have been to.  the pedal karting and bouncy castle was an extra  (additional cost) and only came on after 7:30 PM when it was quite cold for the kids.The food was very monotonous and all five days had pretty much the same food apart from a couple of dishes which changed. the meat was tough as it was left under the hot lights for a long time and the stews lacked any flavour. the kids food station had the same food every single day! chicken nuggets and pasta. this was really disappointing and not expected from an apparent 5 star hotel.They didnt have a heated pool and the small indoor  pool which is part of the spa is an extra which needs booking and gets booked up pretty fast. There are 5 lifts but there still lots of waiting for lifts most times.Now for the Good StuffThe all inclusive had a decent range of drinks and the snacks shack was really good.  The salads and fruits in the buffet restaurant were fresh and really good quality. The hotel is kept very clean and is the biggest plus of the hotel. The free shuttle to old town is also a really good service and well used too as the bus was almost full for most journeys, Uber to old town was quite cheap so even if you miss the bus it around 5 euros to get there from the hotel.There is a spar at 2 mins walk which is really handy to get anything you might have forgotten to pack.All in all this is a 4 star hotel at best disguised as a 5 star. Some people enjoyed it but it just wasn’t at par with the other 5 star properties we have stayed in with Jet2 holidays.We will not be returning to this property again but i guess its ok for budget holidays if the price is right",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Charlottta,7,Charlotttawrote a review Aug 2013,"I stayed here in June and I was absolutely thrilled with the quality of room and choice of 3 swimming pools. This is definitely 4* plus. Our room was equipped with a high spec kitchen as well as tv.Staff are accommodating and friendly.An absolute MUST is to pre arrange transport from the airport. It's £120 each way in a unbooked taxi which I was not aware of. The hotel can arrange a rtn taxi for £160 rtn but the best advice would be to hire a car for approximate £150 for a week.You need a taxi to get to local town for restaurants and local shops  so if you do drive, car hire is the best option.",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,4

It could have tables, sofas, board games, PlayStation, nothing... Rooms should be cleaned every day. During the night the electricity failed, the internet was not sufficient. Room cleaning could be done daily. Positive side, the pool, the location, the view, the peace. Very good for families",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,2
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Sophie A,8,Sophie Awrote a review Aug 2015,"We always do a lot of research when booking a holiday so we were not disappointed when we arrived and it was just as nice as expected. We were always met at reception by very friendly staff. Our room C3H was lovely to relax in. The kitchen was well equipped with utensils, the appliances were better than we have at home! We were glad of the washing machine, and the maids used the dishwasher if ever there was dishes left out. We loved the shutters in the rooms as they blacked out the rooms completely for a good nights sleep, and the rooms were very sound proof.We visited a few beaches but mostly stayed to Porto do Mos as it was so close. We used the loungers at €12 for 2 for the day. The other beaches in the area are Praia Dona Ana which is about 30 mins walk away, and a very small Camillo beach, good for snorkelling but not one to relax and spend the day on. Further down the road is the lighthouse and you can walk down steps to get a small boat trip around the grottos. it was €12.50 per person, our guide pointed out all the names of the rock formations. It does get very busy on the water round there with kayaks and other small boats but it was still very enjoyable.We walked into Lagos from the hotel a few times and would say if you are fit enough to do the walking and don't mind paying for taxis back in the evening a car is not needed as some have said. The taxi to Lagos was between €5 and €8 and the walk (depending on the heat of the sun which sometimes slowed us down) is about 45 mins or 1 hour if going to the marina.  We used Days of Adventure for a dolphin trip and were thrilled to see them so recommend this.On our frist day we ventured out in search of the supermarkets and eventually found Intermarche, we were able to ask at the customer service area if they could phone us a taxi. There are also a couple of other smaller shops within 15 walking distance.We only used the pool area a couple of times, mainly in the first week due to the fact that everyone descended on the loungers sometimes before the pool guy had finished cleaning it to put their towel down to reserve it while they had breakfast. One day we saw a member of staff remove all of the towels that had reserved loungers...all but 2 were not taken and only 2 people were sat out. Not sure what happened but it didn't stop people doing the same the next day. There were a very limited number of loungers and would recommend the hotel invests in more as this was the only thing lacking.Overall it was a lovely relaxed holiday and would suit couples and families who don't want to be too close to the busy centre of Lagos. There are a few entertainment bits on at the hotel...a reptile show one day, free diving lesson in the pool another, Portuguese night at the hotel restaurant etc, we didn't try these but some have said there was not enough entertainment...I guess this is the kind of place you go to entertain yourself...relax...and enjoy your surroundings without the noise.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,4
Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,Paradise36766716771,0,Paradise36766716771wrote a review Aug 2023,"A spacious apartment centrally located in the center of Porto. Clean, tidy and fully equipped. No problems with noise from outside or from the other apartments.Very friendly and hospitable welcome. The owner does not stay in the complex and there is no reception, but someone is always available (through a WhatsApp group that has been created) for questions or tips.Good bakery at the end of the street for a nice breakfast, but also around the corner (on the square) a good place.

The Boliqueime Inn Hotel,TravelCat60,10,TravelCat60wrote a review Nov 2014,"I booked out the hotel for a group. The rooms were all excellent and very clean, the food was of a very good standard and many in the group chose to eat in the hotel every evening. As many of the rooms were used by singles the price was very reasonable. Geraldine & Peter were excellent hosts Be prepared to use taxis as the bus stop 10/15 mins and railway20/25 mins are a bit of a walk  and it is not always possible to get a taxi for these short journeys. However we used public transport to get to Faro & Albuferia quite easily. They are upgrading the rooms over the winter and hopefully will add tea /coffee facilities in the rooms for that early cuppa that our group would have liked, otherwise could not fault it. Swimming pool area very good and attractive.",Nov,2014,Nov 2014,2014-11-01,2014,4

Waiting for me was the unbelievable breakfast. From all kinds of freshly cut fruit to pancakes, so many local cheeses,cold meats, scrambled eggs, warm bread and fresh orange  juice. The service was warm and friendly. The owner Lourdes is attentive and kind, most professional. She has thought of everything. Don't miss this one.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,5

All the staff were very willing to help with the most basic of questions.  The food is amazing and we really enjoyed the variety of fresh fruit at breakfast and evening dinner. Such a variety of savoury dishes beautifully presented too.We do not have any dietary needs, but no doubt these are catered for on request for guests that do.The hotel is on a hill with a very short walk to the main road where there are small supermarkets, gift shops, bank etc.  Buses that go to the harbour which is just a short ride away.  Also 'Discovering Madeira' open top sightseeing buses which take you up about 3,000 feet on good roads, offering wonderful views.We were in a very comfortable room with comfortable beds and a nice view of the pool area and beyond for 2 days, before being offered an upgrade.  That was equally comfortable with a view looking towards the harbour area.  In both rooms tea and coffee making facilities are provided.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,5

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Macklin,22,Macklinwrote a review Feb 2016,"Just returned from one week all inclusive.  Lovely spacious apartment and excellent maid service.  Kitchen was very well equipped, although we didn't need to use it. Large tv in lounge and bedroom with many English channels.  Free wi-fi.Hotel location very good - we walked in one direction for old town and another for the \"strip\".However, several bad points.  Only friendly face at reception was Daniela who was  helpful and welcoming.  Apart from white haired gentleman who greeted us on arrival, the gentlemen at reception were bordering on rude.  They took ages to look up when you approached and gave you the impression you were a nuisance and their manner was very brusque.  They were always very \"busy\" on their keyboards.We knew we were out of season but very surprised to find the bar did not open until 4pm. Just hours before we left we were told by another disgruntled couple that you could go to the kitchen and get a drink before 4pm!!  No entertainment until we almost left and most importantly we were not aware we would have to pay to use the indoor pool which, incidentally, we could not locate!  The entrance to the leisure club was unattended when we went to explore. We saw changing room and lockers but the pool was not obvious.The Hair and Body Wash containers in the bathroom were empty... just for show. We had to go and buy our own toileltries.  On talking to other people, they said theirs were also empty.We had to pay almost 20euros to use the safe.  (Really? In a \"5 star\" hotel).Food was generally ok but was only lukewarm and once you put it onto the cold plate it was cold by the time you got to  your table.  Deserts, like in most hotels abroad, were the same every day.  Service was not good. One evening my husband was on his desert before a waiter appeared to offer him a glass of wine!The bus which was laid on to take you to their other hotels and then into Albufeira old town was a run down tatty coach with broken seats.  On the Thursday we went to try it out and were told it had gone for \"inspection and works\" so was not running.On Saturday we went to use it but was told it did not run on weekends.  So we had one short trip from our hotel into the old town one evening. Mostly we walked about.We were telephoned on our second day to be invited for a \"presentation\" with the offer of 50% off our next holiday and a free bottle of wine.  Having been caught by this previously in another resort, we were wise this time. But went along to one of their sister hotels in the MGM group to visit the Clube Praia da Oura Hotel just to have a look.  We sat through part of the presentation but said the \"Infiniti\" scheme was not for us and left without our wine.  Very similar set up to another scam operated by Lion Resorts, but this time with \"points\".However, we enjoyed exploring this part of Portugal but would not return to this hotel again.  It's a good 3 star, maybe 4.I don't expect to receive any worthy comments back from this as, looking at past reviews, they just paste in a standard comment.",Feb,2016,Feb 2016,2016-02-01,2016,2
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Eagles525,1,Eagles525wrote a review Jul 2015,"Just returned from an 8 night stay at the Forte Do Vale, great spacious apartment with everything you need, however the bathroom floor & wall tile grout was dirty (grime), a basic bleaching would have sorted it but I expect that until a guest complains it will remain. Also our room (308) was the last to be cleaned & as happened if the cleaners are running late it may not get cleaned. Enjoyed the holiday & would return to The Forte Do Vale as its location is good for both the strip & the old town, wi-fi was a bit of a let down as kept losing connection. The pool area was ok with plenty of beds but not enough shades, the pool was ok but did notice a lot of the mosaic tiles had fell off & was starting to look a bit shabby. The staff were very good & helpful, thank you!!",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,3

The only reason I score a four rather than a five is that some apartment furnishings are beginning to feel dated (expected after 25 years of being open) in areas though some apartments have already been made over to a very high standard; I would visit again only to an updated apartment / villa.,Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4

You can also catch the Metro down to Restoradores station, quite easily. Near to the hotel are small street side cafes, a Burger King, a MacDonalds. There is also a nice park area a 5 minute walk away. Room size was good and it was very quiet. Room was very clean and cleaners were available to do the room every day. Reception staff and breakfast staff were efficient, helpful and friendly. Breakfast had a good choice of foods, hot and cold, with pastries and coffee. 2 slight downsides - wi-fi was a bit weak at times and there is no kettle - only a (to me) complicated coffee making machine. Also the cups were very very small. I asked for a kettle and larger cups, which were provided, however, the room service staff kept taking the mugs away each morning and I had to ask again. I don't know why they can't just put a kettle and larger mugs in each room.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,4

We have visited the hotel a few times but always left thinking the hotel was always just short of something. The hotel bedrooms can be long and dark. The bathrooms certainly needed a revitalisation when we last visited. There's no doubt the hotel has great potential.  In a way I see an uncanny similarity to the Atalaya Park Hotel in Estepona. There is plenty to do around Carvoeiro and it is a charming Portuguese fishing village testing the waters of disco land. The local gossip when we we're last at the hotel was that the UK Special Forces \"Bless Em\" were having paragliding lessons along the cliffs.

Senhor Campus the CEO had a conversation with us and vowed to support his people for as long as possible. This is only the second time the hotel has closed since WW2.

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Lottelli,847,Lottelliwrote a review Nov 2019,"Staying at Reid’s Palace was like a dream come true.It is situated overlooking the bay of Funchal. At first the entrance is rather modest but it has elegance especially when walking into the entrance hall. Very near by are some excellent restaurants and over the road a small pastry shop. Parking is available for free. They have a free shuttle bus to/from town which was very useful for us.The room was perfect. I loved the quality materials - the curtains, bedding, towels etc. The colour theme of blue and white was very classic and I just loved it.The bed was spacious and comfortable and I had plenty a goods nights sleep. There is a pillow menu if you need a different pillow which even comes from aromatherapy (we got frankincense). The turn down service made us feel special and the complimentary soft drinks from the fridge each day kept us going.Not much to see from the balcony but still great to sit outside and see some of their gardens.The bathroom is big. The toiletries are of a high quality. I loved the bath - big and deep. Towels are changed twice a day if necessary.The wardrobes are plentiful and there’s a lot of storage.My only thing I could have asked for was a kettle in the room to make a tea or coffee!House keeping did a great job of keeping things tidy and replenished.Each day there is a notice board with that days and the nexts activities. We joined the garden tour (well worth it) and the Madeira wine tasting (really enjoyable). They also provided free Pilates and aqua aerobics and had several paid for activities.The grounds are very well cared for and there are plenty of areas to sit in peace and quiet. The plants are varied and really interesting.We learnt a lot about the hotel through its many photos on the walls. Really recommend taking time just to walk around the hotel and seeing what you can find and discover! I especially liked the old advertising posters (we bought one from the shop).Breakfast is top quality. You can chose from the eggs of the day if you wish. I loved having different cheeses and salmon and ham. The fruits were all very fresh. It was a very relaxing affair.The pools are wonderful. There’s a salt water one which is warm in the morning but does sting a lot if you have any small cuts or have shaved recently! The other pool is heated which is more enjoyable in the afternoon. The sun loungers are comfortable. What has to be my all time most favourite thing is that they have a falcon to scare away any birds. I’m glad they did because the pigeons were very cocky!It has its own access to the sea with an area in a cave to shower and/or get changed. A small sea pool is also there if getting in the actual sea isn’t your thing.They also have a snooker table and a games room. They have a spa and a gym but I did not use it.The bar has an amazing view over the harbour/bay. The drinks are a little pricey but good. Entertainment is ok (piano, bands, singers). We were invited to a cocktail evening where our champagne glasses just kept being refilled (for no charge!). Really generous. We also dined one evening on the terrace- great food and location but a bit pricey.In all we had a superb stay at Reid’s Palace and I can’t wait to come again.",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,5
Royal Savoy Hotel,Richard B,314,Richard Bwrote a review Oct 2013,"We have been travelling to the Royal Savoy for seven years now and we never tire of the experience. The RS is now a ten year old timeshare and perhaps it does look like it but yet it has not lost the sparkle that drew us to it in the first place. Eight visits later we still enjoy the excellent accomodation, amenities, entertainment and catering. If you wish you could stay within the hotel and enjoy all that it has to offer. We like to get out and about and the RS is within walking distance of the centre of Funchal. Its location is one of its strengths and the redevelopment of the port has enhanced the walk to the town greatly. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance of the RS as well as excellent options within. Once the sister hotel Savoy is complete it will be an even better location. Madeira is a very unique European destination with outstanding walks and a non oppressive lifestyle. As regular visitors we love it because of the pace, climate, safety and variety of leisure options. Always staying in the Royal Savoy makes it so much better. We are looking forward to heading back in December 2013.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,5

Royal Savoy Hotel,allandale712@gmail.com,55,allandale712@gmail.comwrote a review Feb 2012,"Very good facilities & hotel grounds but not just as good as some 5* hotels.Lack of attention to detail in cleaning particularly around the kitchen area of the studio apartment. The meal deals might appeal to some but there is much better value in the centre of Funchal which is only a few minutes walk or a short taxi ride. An odd type of discount is also available to buy drinks or meals which involves buying a voucher  within a day of arrival for 100,200 or 300 euros and is worth 10% extra deducted from the final meal & food bill. We bought one for 100euros and was worth 110euros at the end!

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Jenika A,5,Jenika Awrote a review Sep 2025,"We stayed here for a week, and I can say with certainty that this hotel is not 5 stars. Some positives: they do make the rooms up even later in the day and the general cleanliness of the hotel is very good. Our room was a partial sea view and it did have a decent amount of ocean to look at from the balcony. However, the rooms are small, there is no mirror in the main bedroom so every night I had to do my make up on the floor of the bathroom, don’t bother about bringing any hair appliances as there is no where within reaching distance of a mirror to plug it in. The staff (apart from a couple) are dismissive and if you plan on eating from the snack bar be prepared for a very long wait, my partner on three occasions had to go and find someone just so we could settle the bill. We had dinner in the buffet on the last night and it was substantially below what any 5* hotel should offer. Ready made pizzas (we knew this as the ones we ordered from the snack bar were fresh and very tasty) the dough was raw, stale crackers, two ice cream options for desert (along with a few cake bits) and very limited options. The food was partially so stale because the restaurant was so empty so people weren’t eating, leading to the food not being regularly replaced. We went at 20:30 which should be their peak time and there was around 5 tables eating in total. I felt like I was eating a 5 year old dinner because the selection was so scarce. The chef came and asked my partner and I what we thought and seemed genuinely shocked about us not raving about the food. While this hotel does have some positives, the negatives unfortunately outweigh it.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,3

Hotel Gat Rossio,janhtx,7,janhtxwrote a review Oct 2018,"Rooms are very small.  Bathrooms are tiny. The IKEA like furnishings were fine by me and they certainly helped optimize the small space.  Breakfast was adequate.  Fresh squeezed orange juice was great.  Rice flour sweet cakes were almost too good for breakfast. Everything else was average.  Overall not great value for the money, but not terrible.  My main criticism was the young energetic staff that was a bit disorganized and not up to the demands.  There was a big kerfuffle when we arrived with a large group that apparently handed out their own keys and didn’t keep track of who was where.  Maybe not the hotel’s fault.  Safe wasn’t working so asked to have someone come fix.  Had to call a second time.  We were originally staying two nights with plans to go to an hotel nearer the airport the last night in Lisbon because of an early morning flight.  On our first morning I asked the front desk how long it would take to get from there to airport at 2:30 in the morning.  They said about 15 minutes and they could have a car service waiting at the front door.  I asked if they had a room for the third night, they said yes so we went ahead and reserved.  Only catch was it wasn’t the room we were in so we’d have to remove our luggage by noon and wait for new room.  On the morning we were going to change rooms we asked the desk if there was anyway to just wait a while and change rooms instead of leaving luggage at the desk.  That’s when they said you don’t have a room and we tried yesterday to leave you a message.  Well there was no blinking light on room phone, no email, no text, no note on or under the door.  So how much effort they put in to leave a message I don’t know.  None based on the results.  We had to find a hotel for that night and pack and dress differently than we intended for that day.  It changed our plans for the last day in Lisbon.  Then when we got back that afternoon they said we can have the car service here in a moment and the driver will come to the door to help with luggage.  They said the car would be there in 15 minutes we waited 20 went back to the desk ‘oh we we called a few minutes ago it will be another 7 minutes’, waited 10 minutes went back to desk ‘oh I’ll call and see where he is’. We walked out and went to the nearest cab stand.  Bad last impression.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,3

The bedroom was separated by a sliding door. The amenities were very clean and very modern.The staffs were very friendly. Service was 5 stars! Our room had the view of the canal and was awesome to look out into the canal especially during sunset. We could see the monastery from our room.If you are coming to Porto do choose this hotel for its location as it’s a little away from the busy centre and the view of the canal is amazing.,Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

This exquisite hotel is located in the historic sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte.  The hotel, a former convent, has been recently updated to offer visitors a truly elegant experience.Soft peaceful light pouring in from two atriums in the sitting areas, welcomes guests as they enter.  The combination of white Italian Marble floors, modern furnishings and historic accents give the hotel a uncomplicated chic feeling.In the rooms, views of the surrounding sanctuary abound. Large beds with plenty of cushy pillows and a soft comforter provide a serene sleeping experience.  The rain shower in the bathroom is marvelous! Added features such as a hairdryer, large mirrors and plenty of storage space make the rooms a perfect place to relax and enjoy.The staff is friendly and very helpful.  The continental breakfast (included in room price) was fresh and offered many choices for guests. WIFI is provided in the reception area and soon will be expanded to rooms.Modern elegance, a beautiful historic setting and excellent service make this hotel a must stay!",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,janoka1,20,janoka1wrote a review Jul 2014,"We booked a standard room for a week and were apprehensive about it having read other reviews that recommended a pool view. It overlooked a relatively quiet street and was perfect for us. I wouldn't recommend paying a supplement. We were worried initially as it was opposite the lift - room 3004, but it wasn't at all noisy as the lift was quiet and the hall is very wide. The hotel was absolutely spotless and room towels were changed every day. We stayed on a B&B basis and the breakfast was good, however if you like your fries; the 'sausages' were mini frankfurters as seems to be the case in other hotels in the area, the mushrooms were from a tin I suspect. The 'rashers' were really not rashers/bacon as such but a kind of fried ham. However, there was a nice selection of fresh fruit, yoghurts, cheeses and breads. Cereals weren't great either but they fried eggs to order and made fresh crepes also. 'Orange juice' was very sweet squash. The main reasons I did not give a higher rating is that it cost â‚¬2.50 (non-refundable) for the safe in the room and another â‚¬2.50 per day for wifi in the room which constantly logged you out. The public wifi did the same. I think a charge for the safe is greedy. There was a â‚¬20 per towel (for the pool) refundable deposit if you returned the towel tokens at the end of the holiday. The location of the hotel is excellent. Around the corner is the ferry to Ilha Tavira (1.90 return per adult) and all restaurants are just a few minutes walk. There is a mini supermarket 2 minutes walk away and the mini-bar in the room  has space for a few pieces of fruit/bottles of water. Tavira is a lovely, sleepy old town with many options for eating out at night. It was a mainly adult location - the pool was coldish so it wasn't used much! The indoor pool is nice.",Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,4

Right across the street from the Hop-on Hop-off bus and a 20 minute walk from the center of town.

Overall though it was a very pleasant base for our stay.As others have commented the breakfast was very good with a wide, fresh selection every day.We ate twice in the restaurant and had 2 different experiences. The first was very good with enjoyable food served by attentive staff. The second was less positive: they seemed to be caught out by an influx of customers (it was raining outside) and the service was very poor - they just didn't have enough staff to cope and it seemed like the kitchen was struggling to meet demand.Overall though I would strongly recommend this hotel.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,4
