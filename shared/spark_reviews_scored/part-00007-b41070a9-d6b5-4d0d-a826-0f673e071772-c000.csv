Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,dzap2022,0,dzap2022wrote a review Oct 2022,This was our first trip to both Portugal and this hotel. We couldn’t fault anything from start to finish. We only wished we had now booked for longer. The selection of different foods each night was a nice thing to have. Trying new foods most nights.

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Agnieszka K,13,Agnieszka Kwrote a review Jul 2015,"Its already second time for me and my family spending beautiful holidays in Belmar hotel. Big apartaments, 2 bedroom, 2 bathrooms, perfect kitchen. Very good breakfast. Hotel restaurant is also light and delicious. Good place for people who doesnt like crowd.Free parking under the hotel makes life very easy.

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Steven D,5,Steven Dwrote a review Aug 2023,"This family (2+1) trip was amazing thanks to care and dedication of the hotel team.  Always helping with a smile.Our excellent room was available on our arrival at 11am which was a great bonus, allowing us to start our holiday straight away.The food in the main restaurant was always fresh and there was an excellent selection, we also had a night in the a la carte restaurant - which was very good.There is a bus shuttle service provided with a regular schedule to Albufeira old town - we didn't get a chance to try as our son was more than happy to stay in the pool and water slides.Would we recommend - a big yes and we will look to stay here again if we visit Albufeira in future.Thanks again to the hotel team",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Aimee F,2,Aimee Fwrote a review Aug 2023,"If you have kids this place is awesome!My critique is that I barely got to spend time with my child as she begged for kids club, they treat the children like royalty.There was a jet 2 rep on site who couldn’t do more for us.I’m always wary about using taxis abroad and the hotel have a company they use, you pay reception and they organise meaning we had peace of mind for car seats etc.Shuttles to zoomarine were timely and well organised.Everywhere was spotless, there was always staff cleaning.Food was a decent selection, I have a very fussy child and the pasta/pizza bar were more than happy to make sure to whip her up something she could eat.You will not go hungry, poolside burgers every day in between meals! Drink selection also good, had plenty of cocktails.We are thinking on returning next year as our daughter just loved the entertainment squad. After each show they come down to let the children take pictures and they were all so kind and enthusiastic to each and every one.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,5

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Boris G,45,Boris Gwrote a review Oct 2014,"We chose Belmar because of the good rating at Tripadvisor and we did not get disappointed. Moreover we were really surprised about the very good facilities and the good service. There three swimming pools (2 outside, 1 inside), one steam bath and one sauna. The water temperature of the swimming pools is perfect! The apartments are well equipped with a good kitchen. WiFi and parking space is for free.

Lisbon Destination Hostel,ImEmmanuel_M,0,ImEmmanuel_Mwrote a review Nov 2016,"Amazing Hostel with great people and processes to help travelers get the best experience. The Sintra Tour was the best because Ana, our guide was so knowledgeable and a great person to be around. She drove us to Sintra and gave an initial explanation of the town. We were then taken to a wine, meat and cheese tasting all from the local area. Ana then gave us options of the best places to visit because of the time constraints and My group chose the Palace, which was amazing.  We were then given lunch and dropped off with an hour and a half to explore our perspective area. After we were picked up and taken to the most western point of Europe to watch the most amazing sunset and scenery. Finally as we traveled back we were further enlightened about where we were and taken to the beach which was truly extraordinary.- Thank you Ana and thank you Destination Hostels!",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,5

Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,Scottt2052014,33,Scottt2052014wrote a review Feb 2017,"Stayed in a studio apartment...it was cozy, clean and had everything I needed. Rui & Olivia were quick to answer any of the questions I had before my arrival. Barbara was there to meet me and shared lots of information to get me acquainted with the apartment and the city. She popped in a few times during my stay just to make sure I everything was good. Couldn't have asked for a better location -- everything I wanted to do and see was in easy walking distance, and there are great restaurants all around the neighborhood.My departing flight left too early for me to use the metro, so Barbara set up a taxi to pick me up at the hotel and deliver me to the airport. The taxi arrived on time and got me to the airport quickly. The driver was professional and the taxi was clean. No fuss, no muss...well worth the 25 euro.Can't wait to return to Porto and will definitely try to book a stay at Casas du Porto!",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,5

You have proper beds, great location and amazing staff! Such a 'homely feel' with Pedro and Joana really looking after you with tours, pub crawls and even great hostel family dinners.One day my mate was sick and asked where he could get to a doctor, instead of giving directions, Pedro and Joana's father picked him up and took him to their family doctor where he skipped waiting around for an appointment and was treated.

Vila Galé Albacora,P-K1999,56,P-K1999wrote a review Oct 2012,"We stayed here about 4 years ago, have never returned to anywhere ever before, but in need of a total chill out holiday due to a recent family bereavement we decided we would go back. It proved to be an excellent decision, as we were familiar with the area and the hotel so didn't feel the need to do any local exploring. The hotel was much the same as previously, ideal for a relaxing couples holiday, our favourite cocktails barman was still there and still offered a fantastic service. We could see the change in the service industry in Portugal since we last visited, in that the rooms were cleaned throughout the day rather than first thing which seemed to bother some people but really as long as it's cleaned each day does it matter when. It is remote to the point of there being NO bars, shops, restuarants, cafes within the immediate vicinity but that for us is its huge attraction, it is so peaceful. Unlike some reviewers we didn't feel the need for a car, the hotel bus takes you into town & back for free and if the returns are not late enough a taxi is cheap enough but the fact that you are in a nature resort there is so much to see walking near the wetlands and directly behind the hotel is a fabulous small beach again ideal for a relaxing walk. There is also a boat (small extra charge) that takes you to the adjacent island where there are many beach bars and restaurants. The rooms are a little dated in decor but we feel that is part of the hotel's charm rather than that being a negative point and they are cleaned to a high standard which is surely the important factor. Breakfasts are varied in choice (our first morning was a Sunday - don't be put off by the weekends as the hotel attracts many locals on short stay so it can be rather frantic) we ate many lunches from the bar, reasonable choice and price and we had dinner 3 nights choosing the buffet one evening which was ok, not fantastic but plenty of choice and decent quality, and a la carte a couple of times which was good quality food with classy presentaton for the same cost as you would expect to pay in the UK. Having returned a second time and not been disappointed we will not leave it 4 years before we visit again.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,4

Pensao Residencial Setubalense,philr1911,75,philr1911wrote a review Jul 2015,"We spent 7 nights at this hotel while visiting Lisbon for NOS Alive festival.  The hotel is located on the main street in Belem, within five minutes walk of all the attractions of Belem whilst well located for tram and train into town.The rooms are basic, clean and comfortable and for somewhere located in the hub of a major tourist area, our room was incredibly quiet.The staff are friendly and welcoming too.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,5
PortoBay Liberdade,Emma C,14,Emma Cwrote a review Aug 2015,"Porto Bay lead the way in the hotel business as far as we are concerned. Their attention to detail is superb in all areas.The Lisbon hotel is no different to the others we have stayed in. From the moment Adrianne checked us in, we were made to feel very welcome. She pointed out places to go and things to do around the city and offered us a personal tour of the hotel.Our room had a wonderfully comfortable bed and the best hotel hairdryer we have ever found; not one of those pathetic small ones in the bathroom but a proper one! The shower provided great pressure from the huge waterfall head.Other reception staff were equally helpful in the recommendation of restaurants and were persistent in their attempts to book what we wanted, making numerous phone calls on our behalf.The bar offers a huge range of drinks but what made it stand out from others was the willingness of one staff member to explain to us and another couple about the gin and tonic combinations available. Who knew that there were so many flavour options and which would compliment each gin!We had breakfast each morning on the terrace and there was a decent selection of hot and cold options. Coffee was a little slow in being delivered to the table each morning but it was freshly brewed and there were various juices to fill the gap.We will definitely stay there again.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,4
Casa Pinto,João B,0,João Bwrote a review Sep 2015,"Casa Pinto is beautifully decorated. Each of the five rooms has a theme based on old Portuguese colonies. It's a tiny, adorable place, right in the heart of Monsaraz. The staff was friendly and helpful. The bed was very comfortable. The ideal location for couples. The only downside was the WiFi signal, which was very weak, but that is caused by the thick stone walls. Absolutely recommend it.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Edward P,42,Edward Pwrote a review Aug 2016,"Reids is a difficult one to assess. Some bits are excellent others are very disappointing but, over all, I would say our experience was three star. The worst thing for my wife and I was that we went for a quiet break due to having read reviews on Tripadvisor about the hotel having an older client demographic with not many kids as guests. However, do not be mislead! Reids are now actively encouraging families by offering large discounts for children. As a consequence there are now many loud children particularly in the pool areas. The best thing was the food and (generally) service. I will review the individual pros and cons below:Pros.1. Service - the reception, house keeping and, particularly, staff in the Williams restaurant and the Villa Cipriani are fantastic (but see other comments on concierge desk below). Also it was my birthday whilst we were there and I was brought a little cake at the Villa Cipriani and, on our return to our room, we were treated to a bottle of fizz and some lovely flowers - all uninstigated - a very nice touch thank you.2. Food - the Williams restaurant and the Villa Cipriani restaurant are absolutely fantastic with great views and lovely friendly and helpful staff - absolutely five stars in this respect.3. Situation - if you get the right room the views are fantastic and it is only a short walk into the centre of Funchal.4. Grounds - not as extensive as portrayed on the website but beautiful and certainly worth taking the exceptionally well guided tour (free) by the resident botanist.5. Wifi - excellent and reliable - even picked up wifi on a boat as we sailed past the hotel!Cons.1. Kids - if you are a family then fantastic for you. If you are a couple seeking a quiet break then forget it! One of the two upper level pools is over run with screaming kids and unless you get a sun lounger in another part of the grounds away from the pool you will get no peace (failing that take some earphones!).2. Pool area - there is another small salt water pool at sea level but with not many sun loungers if you wish to get away from the kids a bit. However, there is a problem with people reserving loungers with towels something that I have an inkling the pool staff may be taking tips to do! Consequently it can be difficult if arriving later in the day to get a lounger away from the screaming kids. The main pool on the upper level is lovely but salt water whereas the smaller pool on the same level is fresh water but over run by kids and their inflatable toys! There is a no running and diving policy but this was not enforced and the kids and some adults were diving in and running round the pools playing ball games and using a plethora of inflatable toys. Please Reids try to enforce the rules and ban inflatables - it is so Butlins!3. Gym - woefully inadequate for a five star hotel of this size. We visited the Cliff Bay nearby and the gym was much better. At Reids there are no free weights bar a set of dumb bells that only go up to 10 kg. The upper body weights machines are very limited (three in total as I remember) and there are only about four cardiovascular machines. Changing rooms are nice but do not seem air conditioned like the gym so you tend to be sweating again by the time you have showered!4. Rooms and hotel structure. We had booked the top level of room with a sea view. The only rooms better than these are suites. We were actually upgraded to a suite on arrival but, whilst the room was definitely five star, the view was terrible looking out at the cliff opposite, the Villa Cipriani terrace (wave to the diners!), the car park and a busy road frequented by early morning revellers only about 20 metres away. Oh - we did get a bit of sea in terms of the cove next to the hotel. However, this is not what we paid for in terms of view so I insisted that we be moved. The staff were initially not optmistic stating that the hotel was near capacity. However, after a phone call to our rep, we were, the next evening, moved to a room with fantastic views and a deluxe room which is what we had ordered. However, I have to say that the room itself (remember this is the highest standard of room bar the suites) was at best four star. In fact the bathroom was distinctly three star with only an over bath shower and no extractor except for a pole with which you opened a tiny turret-style window high up in the bathroom. The balcony was also tiny (put it this way, I had one twice the size on a Queen Elizabeth cruise last year). So a little disappointing here. Worse still was the proximity of the room to the pool and facilities. It was a 5-10 min walk for two fit individuals via a combination of stairways, lifts, and extensive corridors to get to the pool - frankly ridiculous and probably impossible for the less able bodied. In addition most of the corridors were not air conditioned and in considerable need of re-carpeting and re-decorating.5. Concierge desk - probably the only major let down in terms of service. We struggled to extract information about the courtesy bus into Funchal being told initially that there was no such bus. Some of this may have been due to a language barrier but, for goodness sake Reids, you have a lot of English-speaking guests, put someone with better command of the language on the concierge desk. The staff also failed to turn up on time to help us down when leaving with our luggage - I ended up carrying two heavy suitcases down a flight of stairs and into a tiny lift (perhaps this is why so few weights are needed in the gym?).6. Dogs in rooms - I am not sure whether this is regular hotel policy but we definitely heard two or more dogs barking in one of the level 8 rooms. Not really a five star expectation!",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,3

Most of the staff are friendly, although they are currently very stretched! The hotel is working on a skeleton crew (we were told that they have got rid of quite a lot of staff)! We did not have any problems checking into our rooms (hence the high rating) but overheard people complaining that their rooms were not ready yet (at 4.15pm). Food and drinks are not cheap especially when there are plenty of nice pub and restaurants around. WiFi is not very reliable too.

Shock on arrival as bathroom is glass however discovered that there is a blind, panic over! Reception were helpful, bar staff and restaurant staff too.  We ate in buffet twice which was good Portuguese food. My only slight issues were that before 9.30 am the pool beds next to pool were taken, towels laid out etc. also on last day if you want a shower when room is handed over you must pay to use shower in spa 5 euro unless you want to use the pool side which I found stifling hot and uncomfortable.

Staff were really friendly, Angie was a little cutie and Bruno was alright when he'd more than two hours sleep :-) It's about 10-15 minute walk from the strip which is no problem if your thirsty plenty of shops/bars to get drinks on the way before you hit the lively areas. Would recommend the hotel price wise etc, its pretty chilled during the day too.",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,4
Hotel Albergaria Dias,Kathleen,69,Kathleenwrote a review Mar 2025,"Great value for Funchal!  The hotel was nice, if a little outdated, but my room was very clean and comfortable. It also had great AC, and a very nice little balcony with a table and chairs. The staff was very friendly, and the provided breakfast was very nice as well.  It was also in a great location within a short walking distance from all the major attractions. Would recommend if you're staying in Funchal!",Mar,2025,Mar 2025,2025-03-01,2025,5
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,gshsjsjsj,9,gshsjsjsjwrote a review Aug 2019,"We stayed here for 7 nights from the 9th of August and we enjoyed our stay.The Hotel is clean and tidy and the staff on reception were very accommodating.The water was a bit pricy at â‚¬3.50 for a large one when you could get the same for 20 cents at the mini market a mere 2 minutes walk from the hotel,so just be careful with hidden costs like this.Overall,we enjoyed our stay here and Tavira is such a lovely place to visit (no McDonalds,Burger King or Subway!ðŸ‘ðŸ¼) that we would definitely stay here again but would probably try a new hotel but wouldnâ€™t hesitate to stay here if we couldnâ€™t get what weâ€™d want in another hotel.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,4

The hob was great  as it allowed us to make a few meals.The view from the balcony of the beach and sea was beautiful.Most of the staff were very friendly and attentive.A small gym is there so you can keep fit.There are a number restaurants near by that serve good food at reasonable prices.The hotel should upgrade the wifi, pronto. It was reasonable for browsing but not very good for streaming or downloading. In 2017 WiFi networks should be better than what we found.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Traveller,2,Travellerwrote a review Jun 2019,"Stayed in a deluxe sea-view room which had an amazing view over the beach and a lovely balcony. Room was modern and clean with good kitchen facilities. I have heard standard rooms are not so good so I definitely recommend staying in a deluxe room. We stayed on a room-only basis so not sure how good the all inclusive is. We did not have any problems with noise however I think rooms nearer the road might have this problem. The larger pool seemed very noisy and rowdy with stag parties however the smaller pool was relaxing and quiet with mainly families and couples. Check-in was very slow with a lot of waiting around to fill in paperwork in the morning, we got access to our room early at about 4.30. To use the safe it is an extra charge which they did not inform us of at check in. Location was great, beside the beach and a few minutes walk to the strip. Overall I recommend this hotel particularly on a room-only basis.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,4

Hotel Travel Park Lisboa,gazzy,1,gazzywrote a review May 2006,"We (a party of 4) have just returned from a 3 night stay in Lisbon.Having booked in February via GTAhotels, we arrived after a very early flight at the hotel. The receptionist was abrupt and didn't even take our names, but just told us to write out a label, place on the luggage and put it in store.While I was writing the labels a couple arrived by taxi, who had spent the previous night in another hotel and were being relocated back.I was suspicious as I had read about overbooking on this site already.We went out for the day and on returning were informed the hotel was over booked. Another couple were already waiting in reception for their taxi, as they too had been overbooked. When shown the alternative, it was further out, so I objected and was moved to another - the 4* Turin Europa.This seems to be too much of a habit. The hotel looked ok, but to have at least 4 rooms overbooked and not informing us, either before in the UK or when we arrived, it positively sloppy.Book at this hotel and you gamble where you are going to stay.All that aside the Turin Europa was brilliant and we had a fantastic break in Lisbon.",May,2006,May 2006,2006-05-01,2006,2

On the contrary, our expectations have been exceeded. Starting with all the staff who were without exception extremely professional, while always remaining very friendly and ready to help in any circumstance. The room was beautiful (very clean and well maintained every day) with a beautiful view of the Doca do Bom Sucesso and the BelÃ©m Tower. The hotelâ€™s restaurants were also of superior quality, with the icing on the cake being the Restaurant Feitoria (with a Michelin star). A few steps from the hotel, you could visit the Tower of Belem, the Hieronymite Monastery, the PadrÃ£o dos Descobrimentos (Discoverersâ€™ Monument), several museums or take a boat ride on the Tejo. In short, a hotel to recommend without hesitation!",Nov,2024,Nov 2024,2024-11-01,2024,4
Casa Holstein,greglS8134OI,8,greglS8134OIwrote a review Aug 2018,"After arriving from Lisbon we thought how could Portugal be any more beautiful. Well it could, cue Sintra and the amazing Casa Holstein. My wife and I have been lucky to have stayed in some lovely places around the world but this place will remain top of the list for us. It doesn’t offer all the mod cons, no TV or tea and coffee in room etc but didn’t mind a bit. The grounds and rooms are amazing. Truly a classic European get away where relaxation around the pool while surrounded by European treasures like Pena Palace is something to treasure. Will definitely be back. Staff amazing. I have noticed some people criticize the lack of TV and other hotel basics but if that’s really important to you there are always more options but they won’t offer the special and unique setting this magical place offers. Don’t change a thing......",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Suzy C,1,Suzy Cwrote a review Aug 2025,"This is most definitely NOT a luxury hotel!Room towels not replaced once taken by maids, no storage and only 8 hangers in the wardrobe. Very outdated room. Asked for mattress to be changed on the first night as could feel all the springs, wasnâ€™t changed so ended up putting duvet on top to make it slightly more comfortable.Food lukewarm and very limited variety, in the buffet restaurant, more bones than chicken. Only got booked in twice to the other 12 restaurants as all fully booked however they were half empty on the nights we did get in.Pool opens at 9 however pool bar does not open till 11 and no where else to get a drink. It is very small and offers limited variety.Main bar lacks seating for the 500 rooms and if you want to watch the very low budget, school play entertainment then be prepared to stand. Bar closes at half 10 which is most disappointing.The list is endless of problems in this massive complex that just does not have the facilities to deal with the amount of people.Money needs to be spent on this complex to make it the 4* it claims to be. It is 3* at best. Thank goodness we were only there for a week",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,2

Legendary Lisboa Suites,walsh_mica,12,walsh_micawrote a review Jun 2013,"The bedroom at this hotel is very clean and tidy and fairly modern, lots of english TV Channels which came in handy when it rained! We were at the front of the hotel and some nights it was noisy from traffic and public.The choice of food at breakfast is by far the worst I have ever seen for a 4* hotel - I would rate this hotel a good 3* but no way a 4!!! On the first morning their was one piece of bacon, scrambled eggs and mushrooms - and thats it!!!! I decided to get a croissant and let my partner have the bacon - stupid me, it was stale!!! So i then ate cereal (which i very rarely eat) every morning for the next 4 days!There is a mcdonalds on the same road as the hotel - i would go there for breakfast instead!We struggled to find places to eat in Lisbon there seemed to be a lot of cafe type places so getting a hotel that does a decent evening meal would be a good idea - we were B+B and I am not sure if this hotel offers an evening meal but I can imagine it being pretty crap if it does!The location of the hotel is a good 10-15 min walk to the centre where the shops are. I spent 4 nights at the hotel and i think it was personally a bit too long - however it did rain the whole week we were in portugal so that did not help matters!I would not stay here again or recommend this hotel!when we asked for a taxi to the Aquarium they said they did a transfer instead for 15 Euros and we presumed if we got a taxi it would either be more or we would get ripped off - no turns out we would have actually saved 5 Euros as the balance was only 9 in the taxi!Then when we booked a transfer for the airport thinking we would pay the same 15 Euros as before they didnt take our payment and told us to pay the Taxi which then cost us 20 Euros - not too bad because it was about a 20min drive but it just made no sense!Oh and the lifts are very bouncey!",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,2

Pestana Bahia Praia,HuKe,1,HuKewrote a review Jun 2024,"The hotel room is great and really spacious!The surroundings (park) are beautiful!Before we booked we mailed the hotel that we were travelling with a dog. They told us this was no problem. When we arrived they notified us that they only take dogs that are below 15kg. Well f**k us, because our dog is 30kg. We asked what we need to do now. They were VERY UNFRIENDLY and VERY UNHELPFUL. They told us they need to check with the manager if we can stay for the night or not... Well we were in our room not sure if we can even spend the night there... So we also didn't go out because if we need to find another stay on such short notice that would be stressful. We went to the reception to ask if we can stay or not again after a few hours of not receiving any answer, they told us to wait until tomorrow.The next day the same thing, they told us that maybe we have to leave but they are not sure yet... Well that really was some miserable service!! In the end they let us stay, but the communication was awful!The food was mediocre.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,2

Such a difference - peaceful and quiet! Soundproof. Spotlessly clean.Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and all staff we encountered friendly and efficient.Hotel can organize private transfer to airport €30 for 2 people/cases.,Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,5
