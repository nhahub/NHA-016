Villas Barrocal,S B,0,S Bwrote a review Mar 2022,Lovely part of the algarve.  Old and new.  Everything is a short drive away. Close to the best beach In the algarve in my opinion. Very tranquil.  Good tennis courts.  Great pool.  Lovely staff.  Very cheap for long stay.   OutstAnding level of interior for the price.  The top floor accommodation with car bay parking is really fantastic for the money.  What a place. For the value factor I can’t rate this place enough !! I’ve returned around 6 times.  Thumbs up guys !,Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,4

The breakfast and dinner served in the hotel restaurant were delicious. The pool on the roof is fantastic. Hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. We spent a great week in the sun.

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,amina198,17,amina198wrote a review May 2023,"An absolutely beautiful family hotel, with activities for the kids to do all day and evening entertainment.Nitto and the entertainment team were fantastic and non-stop.Lots of sports and games throughout the day.Onsite aquamarine, AstroTurf football-basketball, onsite tennis, outdoor pool with swim up bar, although it was cold but cooled down once bathing in the sun. Also another larger pool on the quiet side of the hotel and a pool with kids slides.Indoor facilities - well equipped gym, spa, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi all are charged to use.A La Carte resturants were lovely: Rodizio Grill, Italian, main Resturant buffet was amazing, plenty of food, salads, fruits, deserts, kids section and all day outdoor pizza, pasta.The outdoors buffet resturant was lovely its a bar snack with unlimited crisps, icecream, sandwiches, pastas, drinks machines, fresh juice, the usual coke, sprite, Fanta. The bar staff make mocktails which were lovely.A great terrace roof bar in the evenings.The rooms are well equipped with blow dryer, fridge, AC, it was a double bed which came apart into two single beds, with a 1.5 sofa bed.Safe is in the room also (no charge).Towels provided for the rooms, towels provided for the pool side.Multiple TVs in the lobby and there is a small games room for teens, kids.A shop onsite selling usual snacks, floats etc.A great hotel. Had a great week there 7 nights with two sisters.There is a shuttle bus to take you to town and beach, we never used it as it ran 1 time an hour. It was full with families and kids. We did walk to the beach 45mins and also to the harbour we took a taxi, we also walked to bar street exit and walk to your right, its about 10mins walk.There is a nice supermarket 10mins walk too. Lovely fresh local produce or souvenirs.We did a few trips into the old town and new town, a church to see, few monuments and we went to the marina. We did parasailing which was amazing at 70m up in the sky to see the coast and beyond.We also did a boat trip same day to the benagil Caves and a half day down the coast. Dipped in the sea and back out within 3mins as it was beyond freezing but loved every minute of it.",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,5
Mayer Apartments,bill durning,63,bill durningwrote a review Jul 2018,"Small beach front apartment block of apartments of varying sizes. Has pool and snack bar available. Well run and orderly. Has wifi( at a small charge per item,) which works in the apartment and at the poolside. Jan and Adrian are the husband and wife team who have run this holiday home for 25+ years and are most pleasant and anxious to ensure your holiday is successful. Nothing is too much trouble. A 3* which is fairly rated and priced accordingly. My GF self catering studio apartment was clean and basic and  had all we needed. Luz itself was sedate with ample eateries and a most excellent beach --albeit with a freezing Atlantic. We have been before and will  go again to join the many returning guests. Recommended for a quite week relaxing. Be aware that being on the beach and road there is some traffic noise as the resort wakes up each day but nothing too bothersome. Never heard a disco but music could be heard from the adjacent cafe/bar but not into the early hours or anything silly!",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,3

PortoBay Serra Golf,Sandra M,1,Sandra Mwrote a review Oct 2013,"This is a small hotel of considerable character and has a lovely atmosphere.  It is very quiet and peaceful with lovely gardens.  It offers excellent service and superb food.  Every area of the hotel was spotlessly clean.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  The hotel is very close to the golf course, but apart from this there is nothing much of interest in Santo Da Serra, and a car is essential.  We were very glad to be in this hotel,  rather than in the busy city of Funchal.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,4

Rented a 2 bedroom apartment while attending a conference at the Centro de Congressos da Alfândega do Porto.  The apartment was conveniently located to both the conference center and the waterfront.  Very nicely furnished with plenty of space.  The breakfast option is recommended as the refrigerator is stocked and fresh bread delivered in the morning - more food than I could possibly consume.  Friendly management with excellent suggestions for restaurants, tours etc.  I would definitely stay there again.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,lion34,81,lion34wrote a review Oct 2016,"We visited as a family, 3 generations, as Infinfti members. I didn't feel the facilities in the apartments were as good as some of the other properties we have visited. We ended up eating out every evening, but I think cooking dinner would have been tricky in the small kitchen. There is no oven, just a microwave with grill function that is above head height, and a hob. Using the sink you feel as if you are going to bump your head on cabinets. There were various small issues that required a call to housekeeping, e.g no tea towels, bath towels removed during housekeeping but not being replaced, that were rectified quickly, but became annoying. I found the apartments clean, and the housekeepers were flexible around cleaning if you were not ready to leave the room. The beds were comfy. Our apartment was very nicely furnished; my parents' apartment was more basic.The pool was good but the same depth throughout with no shallow entry point. Unfortunately this put my 5 year old off. There was a toddler pool, but this was too shallow for swimming. The pool bar wasn't always open and drinks were expensive. There was nowhere to but a hot drink e.g. coffee. We didn't use the restaurant, it seemed to cater more for the all inclusive guests.The hotel is well situated; you can walk to 2 beaches, the strip and into Albufeira. We enjoyed our holiday but i wouldn't return.",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,2
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Alice F,0,Alice Fwrote a review Aug 2025,"I chose the Lisbon Destination hostel for my trip to Lisbon and couldn’t make a better choice. The bed is very comfortable and has curtains to maintain privacy; there is a bathroom inside the room and a common one very large and always clean; the staff is helpful and they are all very nice and kind (joao and jota!!) The location is great because it is central just minutes from the center. Here you can breathe a beautiful atmosphere, it really feels like family. Almost every day the hostel also offers activities such as excursions or parties that you can attend for a small fee. I recommend this hostel to everyone, hope to return soon!",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,5
Hotel Madeira,morleyterrier,253,morleyterrierwrote a review Apr 2023,"The Madeira is in a great location in the city centre of Funchal. It is just 2 blocks from the marina, next door to the beautiful municipal gardens and with plenty of shops and restaurants within a 10 minute walk.The rooftop pool area was great for a relaxing day and there were always sun beds available. As the only bar in the hotel, it would have been better if it stayed open later than 22.00Our room had a balcony over looking the street - great for people watching. The room was a decent size but a bit narrow around the door and entrance to the ensuite. The beds were comfortable and the shower strong and hot. The only downside was the lack of a fridge.Continental breakfast was a selection of fruits, cold meats and cheese, cereals and yoghurts. Bread rolls and croissants were excellent.Hot options were limited - scrambled eggs everyday along with a rotating selection of beans/bacon/sausage/mushrooms/tomatoes.The coffee from a machine was lovely and strong.The receptionists were friendly and helpful.We would definitely return.",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,4

There were no steps into the pool but vertical steels ladders and no other aids. The inside pool did have steps but there was a substantial extra charge to use this facility.We had half board and the food was of good quality but invariably luke warm.

Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,Stacey R,106,Stacey Rwrote a review Jul 2014,"WOW! This was an utterly fantastic vineyard hotel.  Highly recommended for a luxurious, relaxed break away from the world.  A fabulous infinity pool overlooks the most spectacular views of the stunning valley.  The rooms are wonderful - very clean, classy, and well equipped.  Wifi is a bit weak.It is more of a hotel than a vineyard, so probably not for real wine buffs as the education about wine is not particularly high level (we were informed that red wine is best with meat, and white wine best with fish...!)  The winery tour was short but interesting.  You have to pay for wine tastings even if you are a hotel guest which was unexpected (although each \"tasting\" is a full glass!)We weren't there long enough to try out any of the walking trails but they looked beautiful.  The previous posts are entirely right about the rather scary drive up to the vineyard - it took us about half an hour to cover less than 10km! But it's worth it when you get there.The dinner (a set 3 course menu which changes daily) was excellent value at €38.  Be careful though - they serve you \"matching wines\" and then just price by the glass (but you have no control over how expensive a wine they serve you!!).  Lunch was NOT good value -  €18 for the smallest smoked salmon salad I have ever seen, albeit a very delicious one.Highly recommended",Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,5

From the time we first entered the lobby, the staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating.We stayed in a junior suite, and it was a nice sized room with a separate living room. It was impeccably cleaned and very comfortable. Room service was quick and delicious. The spa and indoor pool area were very relaxing.We found the hotel to be well located. It is just off the Main Street - Avenida Liberdade. It's location made it a bit quieter than being on the Main Street, but was an easy and beautiful walk to the city center.We would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Lisbon!",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Anne D,507,Anne Dwrote a review Apr 2023,"Lovely hotel on the outskirts of Lisbon. There was a metro about a kilometre away which was an easy way to get into town. Our room was very comfortable and the breakfast had a great selection. The omelettes made to order were delicious and the fresh orange juice is always a pleasure. The Concierge Lounge was small but very comfortable with lovely snacks. The only thing on the second night we were there it was more like a kindergarten, there were so many kids there. It was a bit chaotic with kids serving themselves with no adult supervision. Not as relaxing as typical Concierge lounges in the chain, a bit disappointing that no one was asking the parents to take care of their kids. One other issue was that there was no lift down to the garage level so you either had to carry things up stairs or wheel them up the car ramp. Overall a great stay.",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,4

Third time in the hostel, third time i stay in the 12 bedroom, until then I never had any problems with the music coming from the restaurant during the night, it was understandable, but waking up every day at around 7am by loud music and the vibrations of the restaurant speakers was irritating and unnecessary.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Alison S,3,Alison Swrote a review Jul 2016,"The pool,while not typical Marriott resort level, is  nice. Staff are helpful. Room was very nice.The big problem with this Marriott is that it is so far off beaten path you have to take taxis everywhere. We even tried to take the metro but you have to walk over a freeway overpass to get to the hotel.They do not offer shuttles of any kind to the downtown area nor to the metro. A real inconvenience.Taxi rides to the downtown are €10 or more. Suggest you calculate that into your budget, at least €20 per day or more in taxi rides. No way around it.Concierge service is fair. They talked us into taking a gray line bus tour for €23 per person. The bus is not air conditioned with little shade and rude drivers. Our driver almost mowed down a Pedestrian.There are other tour alternatives, not available through the hotel, take those.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,2

Royal Savoy Hotel,Peter H,270,Peter Hwrote a review Jan 2013,"We have owned timeshare at the Royal Savoy since 2004, visiting the island of Madeira, at both Christmas and in April. The apartments are superb, comfortable and with splendid views of the sea. (Except perhaps for some of the corner apartments). The great merit of Funchal, is that there are many restaurants, catering for a good lunch at 7 or 8 euros or the more expensive restaurants for a good night out. With the Royal Savoy, we can self-cater from inexpensive supermarkets and then treat ourselves at the more expensive restaurants on other nights. Do not ignore the Portugese wines at several euros. They do not pay the tax on alcohol that we do. Yes, the prices in the hotel are quite high but the time may come for all of us, when we cannot travel too far. This Christmas was the best ever, with temperatures around 21 for the three weeks we were resident. There is also plenty of culture and botanical gardens to visit. We cannot wait for April to come round again.",Jan,2013,Jan 2013,2013-01-01,2013,5

The room felt welcoming and was a good size, well equipped with lots of shelf space for clothes and enough hangers!  We had a very good walk in shower as well as a bath, and thoroughly enjoyed sitting on our balcony in the morning sun.   But each day really began in the breakfast room beside the two infinity pools, where the hostess greeted us each day with such enthusiasm and smiles, with all the breakfast staff equally pleasant, it was just lovely to start the day enjoying the warm sunshine and the extensive buffet.The hotel is extremely well maintained, wood floors shining proudly, and we enjoyed classic tea on the sun terrace, and dinner dances as well as the Villa Cipriani restaurant next door.  Only one disappointment was the jazz evening in the cocktail bar: last time we visited there was a lively and entertaining jazz band who got people dancing, but not this time.   We felt the cocktail bar was the least exciting part of the hotel.   On the other hand the gardens are super and lots of places to sit and enjoy the warm sunny days … but we were lucky with the weather.Finally a big thank you to every member of the staff, they really make each guest feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble.

Royal Savoy Hotel,Scootz1,3,Scootz1wrote a review Feb 2012,"I've stayed at the RS a number of times (timeshare) and have always been impressed with the level of service and cleanliness.  Sadly, this year I noticed  that both are starting to tire a little.  I was particularly dissapointed with the lack of attention shown in the bathroom... liquid soaps ran dry and weren't replaced the following day... the floor around the toilet was dirty on arrival... small areas of mould appearing in the shower cubicle... towel rail loose.  The cleaning staff seem to spend a lot of time making fancy shapes out of towels in an effort to please - I feel that this time would be far better spent doing the basics to get the apartment spotless!!!  My only other gripes are that there is STILL no free wi-fi in the apartments (they charge a small fortune for you to hard-wire your laptop in your room).  You can get free wi-fi in the ground and first floor communal areas, but it slows to a standstill when there are a few users at the same time.

There was a nice mix of different people on holiday, couples, families, groups of friends etc. We are a young couple and for us we didn't deal with a lot of noise or issues with loud groups.

Hotel Convento de Sao Paulo,Diane J,97,Diane Jwrote a review Jan 2015,"In late December my partner and I spent the night in this beautiful place. The hotel is also a museum of hand painted tiles, azulejos, down every corridor and public space. The grounds near the hotel are nice quiet spaces to enjoy a bit of peace and history. The family that owns this place has transformed what might have fallen into ruin into a beautiful destination.All that said we were disappointed, there might have only been a handful of us staying that night. It was cold and a bit rainy, not great weather for exploring outdoors. We were also put in a small room, off the car park, not in the main building. We wandered the main building enjoying the tiles, but felt a bit like trespassers as our room was in the stables. Why management did not house us in the main building is lost on me. Initial experiences determine if there will be a repeat. When a hotel is nearly empty, the best practice would be to impress the guests with a nice room.Dinner was very good, with excellent service. The room is a former chapel with fantastic tiles and high ceilings.We might go back in the summer for a longer experience, but there are so many amazing places in the Alentejo to explore it is not a priority.",Jan,2015,Jan 2015,2015-01-01,2015,3
Pestana Viking,janb02,83,janb02wrote a review Nov 2013,"Yet again we had a very enjoyable stay at the Pestana Viking. Our sea view suite was excellent and well looked after.  We appreciated the improved internet access, and thought the 1 euro charge a night excellent value to be able to access the internet in our room was well.  We enjoyed the entertainment and it was nice to see more people in the bar area.Breakfast was good as on our previous trip but we tend not to eat in the evening so did have dinner at the hotel, but a lot of people seem to be having a meal.  We particularly appreciate the facilities in the room, fridge, sink, microwave etc as it gives flexibility with eating. this was our second trip this year and will hopefully be back in the new future.  ,",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,4
Pestana Viking,rhighet,59,rhighetwrote a review Jun 2009,"4 weeks of vacationing in Portugal - Pestana Viking was by FAR the best 1 week stay we'd experienced. Very comfortable suites, very clean, well appointed, well equipped. Pools/spa were very clean, staff were much more pleasant and service conscious than any other Portugal hotel staff we'd encountered on our previous 3 weeks in the Algarve. Pestana Viking has great parking for cars, a super gym, fabulous indoor heated and outdoor unheated pools and spa and sauna with lots of deck chairs and lawn lounges and just a short stroll down to either of the two cliff encircled beautiful beaches. We only ate their breakfast buffet once which consisted of fresh and varied foods, but it was very good. A rental car is a must here because of it's rather remote location, but Pestana Viking is \"centrally remote\" and 10-30 minute drives from the hotel is all that is needed to reach 'oh so' many nearby towns and cities for unlimited cultural views and sights (you'll find that a GPS here will be invaluable). Business center has 2 computer stations and WiFi in lobby is free.It's impossible to be disappointment here and I just can't say enough about Pestana Viking (but sure could say lots about our other disappointing Algarve hotels).",Jun,2009,Jun 2009,2009-06-01,2009,4

Hotel Travel Park Lisboa,Audrey B,76,Audrey Bwrote a review Apr 2014,"I stayed at the Hotel Travel Park 4 nights. Room was clean, the staff was amazing (they helped us a lot with our little expeditions in the city and gave us great advices). Also, the breakfast was good... Not a 5 stars breakfast but you will for sure eat a good breakfast! The WiFi connexion was good. I was able to speak with my family on Skype in my room.The location of the hotel is not bad. It's sadly not in the middle of the action but you can go out and reach the bars after a 15 minutes walk. If you want to stay in a cheap hotel but with a good service, you should go to the Hotel Travel Park.",Apr,2014,Apr 2014,2014-04-01,2014,4
Hotel Albergaria Dias,HobbitLondon,122,HobbitLondonwrote a review Jul 2010,"On arrival you are given a guided tour of the hotel and a welcome drink and from there on in the holiday gets better and better. Nothing is too much trouble for Mr. Dias and his family and staff. A more peaceful haven you could not find. Wonderful breakfast, clean rooms and everything that a five star hotel has to offer and no fighting for sun loungers. A variety of good restaurants nearby. If anything was changed about this hotel it would be a shame.  A thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing holiday from start to finish.",Jul,2010,Jul 2010,2010-07-01,2010,5

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,DickTurpin4,14,DickTurpin4wrote a review Oct 2018,We had such a lovely week in this hotel - nice friendly staff all round the hotel. Beware that water in the fridge is not complimentary though. Ours was left on our table not the fridge so luckily we had the money refunded by an understanding member of staff when we explained.Our room was clean with comfortable beds but unfortunately was next to a very loud banging door. We weren't sure if a service door or just older people getting up very early but it banged constantly from 5.30/6am - not ideal when hotel stays are all about rest and getting a good lie-in. It woke us up every morning hours before our 4-yr-old daughter did and we had asked for a quiet room.Overall a great place with nice food (we ate a la carte) but bring ear plugs.The facilities for children were also quiet old and tired when the rest of the hotel seemed well kept. Not a lot of children there though. Mostly pensioners on bus tours in October so I think we were out of season for the activities.,Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,3

Unfortunately not in the city center.The breakfast was good, typical portuguise, a bigger choice of international food would be nice.But as usual if the hotel is that good, the restaurants are not very cheap... if you don't want to spent to much money in the restaurants of the hotel, there is an excellent restaurant just around the corner. very good value!",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,4

The rooms were immaculate, the welcome and attention to detail in a lovely relaxed way made the holiday special. The location was perfect as it was minutes from great restaurants- try Portau  for atmosphere and real Portuguese cooking. You are remembered like a friend if you return a second time. The hotel was like an oasis with lights among the trees  lighting the way back up the private alleyway from the old town. Wonderful.",Feb,2009,Feb 2009,2009-02-01,2009,5
Casa Morais,Ian T,74,Ian Twrote a review May 2017,"We were two couples touring Portugal and decided to stay at Casa Morais based on the reviews. The reviews are spot on.The renovated guesthouse makes a very comfortable place to stay with generous sized rooms, nice sitting areas inside and out, and generous hosts.  Rosa and her sister made sure we felt welcomed and gave us lots of information of the area.We walked 10 minutes across the road for a dinner of sucking pig that was great.The accommodations are very clean, and the breakfast was more than ample.The only negative was that the beds were quite short.This is a good value place to stay in this area.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,MaryCork,265,MaryCorkwrote a review Oct 2016,"We had a most relaxing week here in mid October 2016. We have only good things to say about our stay at the hotel. The room 2073 was quiet by night, was light-filled, spacious and airy, nicely decorated and clean. The balcony overlooking the pool made it even nicer. The outdoor pool is a lovely sight, with plenty of loungers and umbrellas. We asked for a kettle to make hot drinks and it was immediately delivered. There is a mini fridge in the room where you can conveniently keep bottled water. The staff are all very nice and the food fantastic. The buffet breakfast was among the best we've had anywhere in the world. Regularly replenished and very organised. We also had dinner there one night and it was also very good. The location is perfect for everything you're likely to want to do in the Algarve. With fairly good bus and train services to Faro and beyond, we didn't bother with a car. If just staying in the locale, you walk everywhere. Note, the cobble streets means you have to wear flat shoes and dragging suitcases from bus or train stations isn't ideal - get  a taxi. It might sound like a hassle to take a boat to Tavira Island where the main beaches are, but it's totally worth it and at 2euro return, extremely well-priced. We spent a couple of fabulous days lounging in one of the restaurants on the island, having drinks and meals all day. There is an amazing art gallery right across from the Vila Gale hotel - beautiful pieces and the owner Karen is also an amazing artist herself - we bought some of her work. Behind the hotel is a superb food market. Some of the restaurants in Tavira may look like cafes or greasy spoons, but the food belies this - all dishes we had were wonderful. We particularly liked the freshly-cooked Indian meals we had in Taj, along with grills at America Restaurant and pizzas at Mamma Mia. Prices are all good too, as are the prices in the hotel itself. We didn't use the spa but it sounded lovely. Having had such a lovely Vila Gale experience, we would definitely choose another Vila Gale hotel if available in the areas we were visiting.",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,4
Mareta View Boutique Bed & Breakfast,MandMetc,66,MandMetcwrote a review Apr 2012,"The Mareta Beach is a very modern place to stay and we enjoyed our time here.  It is in a very good location with a view of the sea, and just two or three minutes from a nice beach, and ten or so minutes from cliffs in two directions.  The rooms are very comfortable and fitted with large LCD televisions which can receive BBC1 (the aspect ratio is not right for the English channels, but I am being being picky to mention that!).The breakfast buffet is downstairs (the floor below reception) where they do a nice cold selection including fresh fruit and fresh juice.  On one day of our stay the buffet was closed so we were allowed anything from the Mareta Beach cafe, which was nice.",Apr,2012,Apr 2012,2012-04-01,2012,4

We cannot find anything negative about this place.  The beds (plus the pull out) are very comfortable, the room was impeccably clean and the staff are the best we have ever encountered on our many trips abroad.  I could name a few of them but don't want to leave anyone out.  We loved having our daily happy hour out by the pool and the girls serving us were always so very pleasant and always willing to answer our many questions regarding the area and Portugal itself.We hope that someday we can return to Lisbon and there will be no doubt to where we will stay.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5

Yes! Lisbon Hostel,brettinthecity,2,brettinthecitywrote a review Jan 2016,This place has so much going for it I don't know where to start. Everyone that works there is super helpful and friendly and it feels like everybody knows your name from the moment you check in. It's very very clean and the rooms have individual lockers under the beds and curtains for privacy on the bottom bunks. The evening meal is three courses for 10 euros and it's an open bar for the duration - unbelievable value.

I begin with them because even though the Herdade served great food and offered lovely surroundings, they were absolutely the best part of our journey to Portugal. We seldom left the dinner table less than 3 hours after sitting down. Our hosts were welcoming, warm, funny, and  intelligent, and made us feel at home from the moment we drove to the entrance. On the first day, Helena told us to to let her know about anything we might need and she kept her promise, often doing more than any guest should expect. She conducted dinner conversations in multiple languages like a musical conductor. She helped book our tours and even negotiated a refund for us in Lisbon. We will definitely be back, and hopefully with the rest of our family.",Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,5

The TV was tiny and seemed to get just 2 channels and the picture was terrible but I was only in Nazare for a couple of nights and so didn't bother to ask whether it could be fixed.

Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,Dev0nLas,53,Dev0nLaswrote a review Oct 2009,"We have stayed in these apartments many times and would totally recommend it to anybody.  It is suitable for couples or families.  The great thing about the place is that it never seems crowded, always plenty of room.  We have never found it too noisy and  come back from our stay feeling very relaxed. The apartments themselves are so clean and spacious. Top floor has a lovely view of the sea.   The apartments are very close to many, many restaurants and bars, in fact the first restaurant is opposite Bellevue, however you never hear any noise from the town.  We have been going back to Carvoerio for around 8 years and love it, can't recommend it enough. Siggi and Dieter who run the apartments are always on hand to help you with any questons or queries you might have.  Have already booked again for next year.  The other great thing is that the apartments are only a 45 min. drive from the airport.",Oct,2009,Oct 2009,2009-10-01,2009,5

Onyria Quinta da Marinha Hotel,jasarc,4,jasarcwrote a review Aug 2025,"The Hotel da Quinta da Marinha was the major surprise of our holidays. Our expectations were high, in line with a five-star hotel, but they were clearly exceeded. The experience got off to a great start, with the kindness and efficiency of the reception staff, in a very pleasant environment, with a spacious lobby and a light but delicious scent in the air. But it got even better when we entered the room, which in our case – as we were travelling with two small children – was a family room with a real king-size bed and a very comfortable and well-integrated bunk bed for the children, who loved it. Our room had a large balcony overlooking the beautiful Sintra Mountains, a natural aroma of pine trees and grass sitting in front of our room and the gentle chirping of birds perched in the trees. Paradise! For those travelling with children, the two swimming pools – the outdoor pool with a beautiful view and the indoor pool with several accessories and a perfect temperature for children and adults – guarantee fun for the little ones for as long as necessary. We didn't even need to use the Kids Club, which the hotel also offers. But the fun for children doesn't end there: at breakfast there is a spectacular pancake machine, which ensures that the little ones start the day cheerful and well fed. For adults, there is no shortage of options, with different alternatives every day of our stay. I would highlight the freshly squeezed orange juice and the variety of artisan breads and cakes. A true oasis for all the family: more than a hotel, Quinta da Marinha is a destination by itself.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,4
