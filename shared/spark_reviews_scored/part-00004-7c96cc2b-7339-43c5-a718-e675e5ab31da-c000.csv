Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Paul E,9,Paul Ewrote a review Oct 2019,"Just got back after a lovely relaxing week at the Jupiter.  Staff great, food great, rooms great, entertainment good and drinks good.  And the but?  Well the dinning hall (Its not a Resturant) is a problem albeit the food as i said is great.  When you arrive at the dinning Hall your room key is scanned and then your are on your own!  First job is to try and find a table, then one of you stays with the table whilst the other one gets their meal; swap places and hopefully you will be eating a warm meal together!  Then you take turns getting the next course in case the table gets cleared and someone jumps in and claims the table... bit stressy to be honest and something that should be fixed both easily and quickly.  Great coffee from the bars but the coffee from the machines in the dinning room, when they work, is a bit meh.The Hotel has a very minimal/contemporary/sharp interior and that is also reflected in the furniture and lack of any art work; we really quite liked the look.  Overall, I would say that this Hotel is a must for families but if you are a couple be reminded that kids are kids so be prepared.  On the positive there is plenty of room around the Adult Pool, good quality beds and immaculately clean; bit chilly (22Degrees) at this time of year though!",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,PhilC49,1,PhilC49wrote a review Jun 2015,"Stayed in a two bedroom apartment in Block B. The standard of this spacious accommodation was excellent – kitchen looked brand new and bathrooms (2) were extremely clean and well appointed.  Twice weekly changing of towels and cleaning by a team of cleaning staff was swift and unobtrusive. The location of the hotel/apartments is excellent being only a 5 minute walk to the nearby lovely beach of Praia de Porto de Mós. Alternatively there are numerous other beaches in the area only a short drive away. Breakfast selection was sufficient though expensive at €52 for a family of 4 – reverted after day 1 to self-catering – visiting each morning the small local supermarket SuperEureka for freshly made croissants and breads. Hotel Bar area was a little sterile – it would have been nice to able to sip cocktails overlooking the beach and sunset rather than the hotel reception area. Didn’t eat in the hotel restaurant, instead visited O António’s on the local beach, O Camilo overlooking Praia do Camilo plus Lagos restaurants. A taxi into Lagos centre at night costs approx. €7 each way. Our taxis were ordered from reception very efficiently and arrived within 5 mins.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Tinkerbell1987,107,Tinkerbell1987wrote a review Jun 2023,"Just back from a recent 2 week family holiday in May and I was honestly so sad to leave this place. It’s honestly amazing for young families. The hotel complex has so much to offer in terms of activities and things to do. The entertainment staff are incredible and so hard working. I cannot fault them, they were excellent with my young 4 year old son.The hotel is clean and spacious and the restaurants are lovely with great selection of food.The hotel is about 35/40 min walk from the old town so my tip for anyone going is to download the Uber app as they arrive so quickly and it’s really cheap compared to the UK fare prices.If I had to be really pernickety and pick faults with the hotel the only negatives I could comment on would be the lifts and the pool temperature. The lifts are very busy at certain times of the day and maybe not enough of them to accommodate the size of the hotel and the guests staying.The pools are lovely and clean but are definitely on the cold side, they could do with being turned up even just a few degrees as I think personally it was too cold for really young children and babies.Having said that it wouldn’t put me off staying here again and I hope to visit again in the future.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,am4193,0,am4193wrote a review Apr 2023,"We loved every moment of our visit to the Jupiter Hotel. The staff and Portuguese people we met were all very helpful and friendly and could not do enough for us. We had 7 days of sunshine and the temperatures were around 22-25 degrees during the day which allowed many hours of fun for our children on the water slides and pools. The water slides are great feature and we all had great fun on them. Our boys also loved the football pitch and played football during the day and in to the evenings. The pool areas are great for adults and kids and have splash areas and slides for younger kids as well as the main water slides. The main pool has a swim up bar which is great, there is also a snack bar which is self service and you can pour your own drinks. You could always find sun loungers available at any time of the day which was great as we believe the hotel was 90% occupied at the time. The hotel also has a separate quiet pool which is fantastic if you want to chill out, we found this a lovely area and there was always sun loungers available at any time of the day.The food and service throughout our stay was fantastic and we always had a good meal with plenty of choice at the buffet. The AI bar and the rooftop bars were also very good and we loved going up to the rooftop bar to watch the sun setting. We never really encountered any ques at the bar and even if there was a few people in front of you, normally you were served within a couple of minutes as the hotel had plenty of staff at each bar. The entertainment at night was good as well, normally having discos etc... for younger children. They have a kids club during the day as well and there is always things happening for the children at the pools.This was a fantastic family holiday and we cant wait to come back!",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,5

Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,SaboChabo,80,SaboChabowrote a review Aug 2017,"Absolutely amazing vineyard setting - panoramic views down to the Douro valley; and great common facilities to lounge and relax around this Quinta.There is a restaurant that serves set menu for lunch/dinner; while tapas and simple lunches are also available for hotel guests.Having a light meal and some wine at the outdoor terrace tables were an absolute delight.Winery visit was excellent, with a new visitor centre/ little museum.What perhaps can be improved a bit was the rooms - rooms (we had the standard terrace room) are decent enough but nothing to write home about.  Cleaniness was good.  Minor issue was the door which creaked for our room.  Air con placement not very practical either (on the floor next to the bed)All in all - great stay at a stunning part of the Douro valley.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4

Luna Clube Oceano,Ruth B,8,Ruth Bwrote a review Aug 2017,"Well worth the money, I'm so happy I got to stay here. Beautiful area and such a clean complex from the reception right through to the apartment. From early on the pool had people at it but we never stayed by the apartment. Five minutes to both the New Town and Old Town strip and it's no more than €5 each way in a taxi. I'd recommend getting a taxi to and from the Old Town. There's a bit of a hill up to the New Town strip but it's a nice enough walk home and not too far. The staff were extremely helpful. Only downfall was the restaurant as the service was quite slow. One of the days we left before even being served and my only problem was that there was only one family in the restaurant at the time. I mentioned this when leaving so hopefully it will be acted upon as I don't know what it would be like during busy hours. Overall I'm extremely delighted I spent my week here and it was more than worth the money.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Huntages,18,Huntageswrote a review Dec 2013,Very we'll appointed hotel.

Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,Jason V,0,Jason Vwrote a review Sep 2015,"Out of all the hostels I have stayed at for the last two months of travels around Europe this hostel has definitely been the best. From the hospitality and smiles that you are welcomed with and the best tips and tricks they give you to really experience what Lagos is really about. The breakfast in the morning was one of the best parts of this hostel. They always had a variety of munchies on the go wether you were hung over or just hungry. Wendy took the time to organise the best boat party, took me and my friends kayaking, surfing, cliff jumping and out into town for feeds and to experience the night life. 10/10 no doubt!",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,5

PortoBay Liberdade,juls21,147,juls21wrote a review Oct 2016,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in early October.  The hotel is lovely.  The beds are so comfy and the rooms are very clean and inviting.  The hotel is up a side road off the main street and approximately 15 minutes walk from the main squares with some great cabins serving food and drink on the way down into the main square  Unfortunately, I have to mention the building works going on opposite the hotel; we were in room 635 and on opening the curtains we were faced with a building site!  This is not the hotels fault I know, but nonetheless it is a building site with banging and clunking work going on from 8 in the morning.  After 2 nights and being woken at 8 each morning (which I know is not early but this was a treat for my husband and I and I wanted to wake when I was ready not because of building work) I asked to move rooms; I was told there was only a disabled room available at the back of the hotel on floor 2; this was fine for us although no bath it was very quite which was great.The downside to the rooms though has to be the bathrooms; they are ok not 5 star though to be honest and the door is awful; it is an opaque glass door that slides shut giving very minimal privacy and the doors rattle as they are being closed; you really need to know someone well when staying here!!My other gripe for a 5 star hotel was the coffee situation; a welcome tray is in the room with a coffee making machine which has pods; the pods in the room are included 2 regular coffees, 2 decaf and 2 teas, once these are used you have to pay 2 euros 50 for pods; I have never in all the 5 star hotels I have stayed in had to pay for refill welcome trays.I have to mention Daniel who is a wonderful asset to this hotel; he was always there to greet us with a friendly chat and a smile and he knew our names and used them from day 1!All in all although I have listed a few negatives the hotel was lovely and I would recommend staying there but only at the rear of the hotel.",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,4
Royal Savoy Hotel,Peter H,270,Peter Hwrote a review May 2019,"We obtained an apartment many years back and delight in the facilities afforded by the Royal Savoy. All apartments face the sea and there is no noise from the road. The most comfortable of all the resorts we have ever stayed in. Almost all you could ask for except they cannot adequately provide for vegetarians. One of the two outside pools is heated. The second I have never entered!

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Jim H,7,Jim Hwrote a review May 2017,"Spent 5 days at Reid's. Generally my wife and I really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is exceptionally well positioned with a beautiful view over Funchal. It is a great place for relaxing with excellent swimming pools and a tennis court. Most of the guests seemed to be retired Brits and the atmosphere was like a club. The staff were  very pleasant and the service excellent. The food was generally very good but because we like to eat early we had most of our evening meals at a local restaurant. There are many and they are reasonably priced. Our only criticism is that the coffee at breakfast was terrible, but then most hotel coffee is. We were not impressed with the Cipriani restaurant in the hotel grounds which serves very ordinary food at a high price and was clearly unenthusiastic about a couple who did not have wine.Nothing to do with the hotel, but think carefully before hiring a car. I am a very experienced driver but I took the rental car back early because driving on the island was far too stressful. Also, when walking to the town, you may be offered free trips in exchange for visiting a hotel and listening to sales patter. Do NOT do this!",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,3
Saccharum,gottrup_friis,121,gottrup_friiswrote a review Dec 2017,"We stayed three nights at the hotel. The rooms have a lot of space and we had a room with sea view which is very nice. The beach in front of the hotel has a lot of stones so we can recommend that you bring bathing shoes, the water is clean and nice. You pay 5 Eu if you need an umbrella at the beach because it is a public beach.The terraces are very open at the sides so if your neighbor is smoking it is quite annoying - we suggest that smoking should be prohibited at the terraces. Despite of the smoking issue the terraces are very nice.The breakfast was ok, but quite ordinary considering that is a 5 star hotel.Good things: USB charger, service minded staff, very good beds, lovely terrace, coffee at the room. The area is quiet, and there are a lot of things to do nearby but we recommend that you have a car.Bad things: heavy smoking neighbors, fridge does not cool much, the hotel and the rooms are rather dark, parking is not for free, the prices at the restaurant are high, but you can eat at the good local restaurants at the marina next to the hotel - especially New Era serves delicious food.",Dec,2017,Dec 2017,2017-12-01,2017,3

GREAT service. The pool and pool area were spotless and plenty of sunbeds. Even in the height of the season cant see there be much of a problem finding one. The location of the apartments were ideal, about a 10 minute walk to the strip with many bars and places to eat. The old town was about 35 min walk away, but the bus was only 1.40 euros or just under 5 euros by taxi. Try looking up the side streets and you will find authentic portugese restaraunts.We will return again and would recommend to anyone, families or groups of friends.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,5
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Luke Jasse,4,Luke Jassewrote a review Jun 2023,"This is not a 5 star standard hotel! Came here with family 7 of us including a 2 year old. Seemed ok on arrival but after we got to the room we found that there is a building site opposite! With no mention of this! Spoke with the reception ( Daniella ) who informed me that they will do nothing to help us. We just spent 8000£ for a week for 3 rooms. They have the cheek to make us pay more money to change rooms. On inspection of the rooms they were thick with dirt, dust everywhere and hallway floors are disgusting. What a joke this hotel is. After being in the hospitality trade for the last 40 years we have never been treated so poorly. The manager leaves early so can't even speak to them till the next day? After going for some food as we'd been traveling all day we got to the rooms at 11pm to find that they hadn't even cleaned the rooms like they promised or made the bed that was requested just completely ignored. When I spoke with reception they said oh the housekeeping has gone home now! Are they for real?!?! Then they swapped our room and just to insult us more they gave us same room on the same side with the building site! What a way to be treated after spending all that money. Words cannot describe the experience we are getting right now. We asked for a refund so we could go somewhere else but they won't honour it. We stayed at the Tivoli last year and you can't even compare them! That was amazing! Wish we had booked to go back there! So don't be fooled you ha e been warned! This hotel doesn't care about you or your satisfaction! This does not compare in any way to previous crown plaza we have stayed in! I will make sure I leave our feedback on all booking sites just to warn people before they waste their hard earned money here! Hotel really let's down vilamoura and should not be here on the standard you would expect.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,1

Noah Surf House,Sally E,8,Sally Ewrote a review Sep 2019,"This is a fabulous hotel. The staff are incredibly friendly and upbeat. Our bungalow was great and I loved the log fire! The food was good both in the main restaurant and down at the Beach House. The Beach House has a really nice ambiance in the evening. The pool and deck areas are comfortable and the pool deck barbecue was very enjoyable. There are plenty of activities on offer if you want or you could just chill! The only downside however, and it is quite a big one, is the location. Santa Cruz is really not a very nice place! It may be better in high season (or even at the weekend) when things are open but we were there in early September (mid week) and the whole place was a bit like a ghost town. If the location was better this hotel would be just about perfect!",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

Ocean Gardens,Dee,3,Deewrote a review Nov 2009,The reviews were correct. A fantatic hotel which had great views (dont forget your binoculars) and very clean.Tips:Try to get a' Bay' rather than 'Sea'  view - rooms 101 to 110 I think. We had room 106 which was not big but had a great view.Food in restaurant downstairs ok but rather unimaginativeDont be affraid to catch the local bus 39 down into the town in the evening - cheap and reliableTown very relaxed - did not feel at all concerned wandering through back streets even at nightRiso is a great contempary resaurant in the Old Town behind the fort - if you like riceLike many hotels with tiled corridors the rooms can be a bit noisy at times but really not an issue as the hotel was always quiet by about 10.30!Pool area is lovely - clean and quiet,Nov,2009,Nov 2009,2009-11-01,2009,3
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Kirsty M,54,Kirsty Mwrote a review Sep 2022,"Hotel was nicer than expected for the money paid. We didn't pay extra for pool view which meant we had quite a non-private, dark balcony overlooking a garage forecourt. That aside, everything else was good.Rooms clean and spacious enough. Breakfast varied. Staff really nice and helpful. Great location. Room quiet at night despite being roadside.I'd have given a 5 star review had it not been for the utter rip-off of being charged 5.40 euros for 2 small bottles of water by the pool on our first day. Sadly it was without any menu being available and we were thirsty and tired and I couldn't believe it, really OTT pricing for the area and I purposefully didn't give the bar any more custom after that! Lovely bottles of local wine available in the supermarket for 2eur, just for context.",Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,4

The marble all around in the bathroom, the giant meeting room, the amazing sea views from the 18th floor and not to forget one of the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.The staff is truly amazing and their level of service is outstanding.

Canto de Luz,Erin B,0,Erin Bwrote a review Mar 2024,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay in the one room Garden level 2 room. Like all others have mentioned, the breakfast was always lovely. We preordered a to-go breakfast on the days we were leaving before 8:30am. Great, safe and quiet location - we walked everywhere easily - good walking shoes or hiking boots are a must. There was some constructions going on around us, but we couldn't hear any of it while in our room - the walls are very think and the doors heavy. Everything is clean and new!Our room didn't have a clothes washer, so we took advantage of their laundry service (one bag for 20 euros). They washed, dried and folded our clothes and delivered them to our room all in the same day! Keep in mind: if you are sensitive to fragranced detergent, you may want to forgo this service, as it was quite strong. We asked if they could rewash all the clothes in fragrance-free soap, which they happily did. Unfortunately, they were still very fragranced. It took us rewashing an additional two times at home to get the scent out. But, if you like scent, you'll love it! Note: the bed linens and towels in the room did not have a fragrance, which was great for us.Our room had a huge balcony overlooking the breakfast area below and garden. It had an amazing electric blackout screen that we could raise and lower for a wonderful sleep experience. Heads up: the bedroom and bathroom are divided by a sliding frosted glass door - this was no problem for us, but there's a little less privacy.The staff was all unbelievably kind, welcoming and helpful! We will absolutely stay again, should we be lucky enough to visit Porto in the future.",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,5
Ocean Gardens,Nigel W,13,Nigel Wwrote a review Apr 2013,"This hotel is on the edge of Funchal (or rather its western suburb Sao Goncalo) so is not ideal if you want to be in the centre of Funchal but it does not take that long to drive into the centre and the environment is much nicer than around many of the hotels in the centre.  It is high up above the sea and from the breakfast room and the left hand end of the hotel there is a fantastic view over the bay of Funchal.  The value was excellent.  We booked it with Easyjet from London Gatwick in late March and for the two of us it was only just over £200 each for flights and the hotel (including breakfasts but plus the usual Easyjet charge for suitcases).  Our room was quite nice and of a reasonable size.  The bed was very comfortable.  There was some slight mold growth on a few parts of the grouting to the tiles above the bath but not enough to be a problem and the bedroom and bathroom were generally very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room had a sea view.  The disadvantage was that there was some road noise from the road in front of the hotel but the road was not that busy and we did not find it to be that much of a problem.  The buffet breakfast was about average and quite acceptable, not the best but certainly not the worst we have encountered.  We did not use the hotel restaurant, so I do not know how good it is.  The menu did not seem anything special and there were much cheaper ones in central Funchal.  There is a free courtesy bus into Funchal but only twice a day each way.  We had a car so did not use it.  I think there may be other local bus services as some guests appeared to be using them but I do not know enough to comment.  There was adequate free parking at the hotel when we were there.  Overall, we are very happy to have chosen this hotel.",Apr,2013,Apr 2013,2013-04-01,2013,4

Canto de Luz,khfs2018,0,khfs2018wrote a review Sep 2018,"We love this small hotel! It's located near the Trinidad station and other bus stations that will take you to the main locations of the city (and outside of the city) in no time and without changes. The area has a fantastic charm and even thought the hotel is near many bars, restaurants and cafes it is still completely peaceful.Our first impression of the hotel was the great taste in design and architecture - It is a completely renovated house. We felt good and comfortable every time we were inside.When we arrived, we were welcomed by the owners who informed us about everything we needed to know to have a comfortable stay. Every morning you will get a \"French-Styled\" breakfast combined with traditional products from Portugal. Delicious, fresh and home made! The staff were so friendly and willing to help whenever we had requests or questions.We recommend that you book in advance because the hotel has more or less 5 rooms (we guess).",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,5

Went to reception following day and asked to change and they had no problem moving us without any questions as to why we wanted to move rooms which ringed alarms.Moved room to a smaller but clean room.Hotel states everywhere including in the hotel that it is family friendly yet there was NO entertainment for kids, they had a big bouncy castle out till Saturday but then took that away to make room for a member only bowls for the winter, then last 2 days they shut the Ocean Bar from 6pm which left absolutely nothing to do apart from sit in hotel room in the evening, was not allowed to use sister hotels that were advertised to be able to use when we booked,NO kid friendly food, 1 drink per person allowed throughout whole meal, no child friendly access to rooms and room they changed us to we had to carry pushchair up and down 4 flights of stairs every day, cleaners wanted us out of the room at 8am but we returned at 1pm and room still wasnt cleaned.",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,1

It is ideally located, making it walkable to almost all of the key parts of Lisbon you would want to visit.  The rooms are very comfortable, and well appointed without being over the top.

Hotel Principe Lisboa,Paul Tarmas,80,Paul Tarmaswrote a review Dec 2013,"Stayed 3 nights in December nothing really to fault, easy access from airport, hotel right opposite the last station on red line San Sebastio. So getting around from hotel on Metro very easy. Reception staff very friendly and helpful as were all other staff. Good size clean room with small fridge, bathroom big enough, just be careful in shower as floor very slippery, comfy beds and quite at night for major city. Buffet breakfast very good nice selection, no hot food but you don't expect that with a continental breakfast. You could walk to old town from hotel in 30-40 minutes, but walk back quite hard work as it is all uphill, just use metro on return, again metro good value 1:40 euro per trip. So all in all great value for money.",Dec,2013,Dec 2013,2013-12-01,2013,4

HF Fenix Lisboa,Departure41401,3,Departure41401wrote a review Oct 2019,"It was the first time in Lisbon and the HF Fenix Lisboa was just the ideal place to ensure a great time.  The staff were exceptional by being friendly and helpful.  They spoke English which helps as we don't know their language at all.  The Hotel breakfast could not be better, I highly recommend it to anyone.  We like to walk so going downtown was not a problem and there is no way to get lost if you stay close to the mainstream.  The park next to the hotel was amazing.  The walk up the hill is so worth it as the view of Lison is incredible.  The room was big but the bathroom was a bit small.  But that is common in Europe.  There are lots of good places to eat within a block or two of the Hotel so that was a bonus.  As we went in October there was no problem with crowds, big lineups, etc.  We stayed a week and that was just right to get a good feel of Lisbon.  Enjoy!",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,5

It's well appointed, clean & tidy. It's a cross between a hotel & self catering. The maids come in & make up beds & change towels every day. There's a lovely little cafe on the ground floor that serves a buffet breakfast.The apartment could sleep six as there is a sofa bed in the lounge.It's situated about 10 minutes away from Pombal & is handy for the tube. Or it's a leisurely stroll down Liberdade to the old town/ front.There's a supermarket nearby & a MacDonalds. We couldn't find many local eating places & so went down into the old town.

Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,Austin Tasious,1,Austin Tasiouswrote a review Oct 2016,"An extremely well located apartment. Number 8. Less than a stone's throw from numerous restaurants. From the front of the apartment you are literally amongst the resort facilities. But from the back (lounge and bedroom) there is no sound at all.Full length balcony (2 patio door access) overlooks very good size pool. With only about 12 rooms there is more than enough room for everybody to be around and in it at the same time.Enormous Balcony is large enough for table,  4 chairs, sun loungers, sun umbrella and room to move around to avoid the sun.Lounge is very good size,. Bedroom also. Shower room has separate bath. Kitchen fully equipped, although we ate out.Note for owner.... Cork screw broken, I promise we didn't do it !!!  However we bought another locally and it broke immediately!! Must be something about local corks.Local restaurants we found generally expensive, especially compared to general cost of things elsewhere in Portugal.Avoid market across the street, very expensive. Aldi fairly close by.Would totally recommend the apartment .",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,2
