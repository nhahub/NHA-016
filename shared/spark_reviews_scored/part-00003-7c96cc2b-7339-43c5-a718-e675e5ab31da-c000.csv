Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Natasha B,0,Natasha Bwrote a review Apr 2024,"So firstly I just want to say I did not read any reviews on this hotel before booking or after until I am now back from holiday.I'm so glad I didn't.We got to the hotel at around 10.30am, we couldn't check into our room until 3pm, did that matter no - there was a dressing room to get Changed into, the front desk checked you in gave you, the band to wear so we could still eat and use facilities until our room was ready and you could put your luggage in their holding area.When the room was ready they called your mobile to let you know..The weather was excellent when we arrived so we went straight for the pools.The out door pool areas are fantastic, so clean and options for every child's abilities, shallow and deep and if you don't have children there is an adult only pool.Staff fantastic.Drinks plenty of options although only one sugar free option if diabetic not so friendly.Food-we only stayed 5 nights so the buffet was our only option, massive selections only criticism was hot food was barely Luke warm, may need to look at the heat source where they are left out.Just to say I knew the weather wasn't going to be as hot for April, so this meant the pools were very cold, for a 4.5 star rated hotel would be great if you could heat them in the colder seasons of the year this would really up your game.I'm going to return again next year in July so won't be a problem then.Entertainment in day was great, the children's disco in the evening before the main event could be improved as was same songs and same dances each evening although really good for very young children, my 6.5yr old found this a little repetitive and preferred the more adult based entertainment. We thought the circus act was fantastic, and the Hollywood night. Some of the adultentertainment was still more children orientated so this could be improved.Overall though we had fantastic time and will be coming back next year.I hope when you read reviews you take the actual constructive criticism away and try to improve on this as some of the reviews I had read are very unfair reviews and do not reflect on how good you are overall. Special thanks to nicco for making my boy feel so welcome and included.See you next year!!!",Apr,2024,Apr 2024,2024-04-01,2024,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Louisa G,0,Louisa Gwrote a review Jul 2022,"WELL WELL WELL.... where do I start?  We had an amazing week at Jupiter. Every single day was filled with fun and smiles. ALL the staff were amazing, kind and very hard working! The rooms were always spotless. The restaurant and bar staff  always attentive. A big thumbs up to the animation team (aka bati cocos) who were beyond spectacular. Each and every one of them was professional, energetic, dedicated and really friendly. They really made our holiday exceed our expectations. I highly recommend this hotel who wants a unique family holiday.",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,5

Vila Gale Porto Ribeira,LizUK,4,LizUKwrote a review Apr 2019,"My team and I stayed at Vila Gale Ribeira this weekend past.  The rooms were lovely, very clean and I loved that each room was named after an artist with accompanying wall art to match.  The general staff, concierge, breakfast staff and the barman, were all some of the best I've ever had to deal with. Friendly, helpful, understanding and most of all, very human. The breakfast buffet was lovely, well planned and although the hotel was busy, you never felt crowded. They were happy to help me figure out the trams, and places to visit. Overall, a really enjoyable stay with very comfy beds. I cannot recommend the hotel enough.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4

Saccharum,Jerry,16,Jerrywrote a review Feb 2016,"We booked the Calheta Beach Hotel , but on arrival there were  offered an \"upgrade\" to the Sacharum with the promise this is 5 star, but we are very disappointed.We stayed in The Cliff Bay 5 star last year , and the Sacharum does not make the cut by a very long way.We paid for all inclusive, but got charged extra in the restaurants, they even charge to use the safe deposit box in the room, and charge for very ordinary films on telly.The food is below standard and the dining staff do not have a clue.Dining is all self service, morning noon and night, and on Saturday 200 extra guests arrived by coach, causing a cue of 30 minutes just to get food.The tables are not set, guests get up to scavange for cutlery on neighbouring tables, and left over wine is offered when they realize you booked all inclusive.They have cleaners removing plates before you have finished the dish, not bothering to replace cutlery.5 STAR ??????? I don't think so !The shower does not work, shampoo runs out, and they charge by the day for instant coffee and teabags in the room if you booked all inclusive.To claim 5 STAR , you have to be striving to be near Michelen standards, but this is a joke.We will not return. Sorry.",Feb,2016,Feb 2016,2016-02-01,2016,1
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Peter R,26,Peter Rwrote a review Jul 2018,"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel for 9 nights , the welcome is very warm and friendly as you expect .  We paid for an upgraded room which was lovely,but odd though that there is no extractor fan so room stays full of steam and doesn’t take the smell away from the looand was told we would get water and fruit and coffee everyday.  Well I would expect that from a 5 star hotelAnyway second day no fruit no more water and the coffee pods not replaced we were told. You have to pay for these. Not to pleased to say the least .  3 rd day we were left one bit of mouldy orange which Itook  down to reception and not even an apology just a look and they took it away .Anyway there is a lovely selection at breakfast but.  Most mornings we had to ask for Hot coffee this happened 7 times out of 9 , also a lot of the food bacon beans sausages are not hot atall. So be prepared to eat cold food with cold coffeeNow for the great part. Out last morning leaving.  Again cold coffee cold food and hair in my scrambled egg.  , not mine as I don’t have anyReally not a 5 star hotel in my opinion.There are broken tiles my wife tripped on outside the lifts should be repairedThe new pool is very nice and I have to say the staff are very friendlyAlso some of the decking around the new pool area has fallen away and some people slipped on this . Still not repaired after 4 daysAlso would of liked to have been told you can store your golf bags down stairs so me and my wife didn’t have to carry them 3 floors and through hotel every dayBeen here 4 times and we won’t be going back.

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,vicky_bl,20,vicky_blwrote a review May 2018,"Spacious apartment for me and my 2 mates, we booked a room with twin beds and sofa bed in the living room area.  I would say though that the sofa bed was not very comfortable and very low on the floor so this might not be ideal for some people.  We booked this on a room basis only for 4 nights but we did have breakfast for 2 of the mornings and for 7.50 euros it was reasonably priced.  Hotel is not as near to the beach as they make out but it was still not a bad walk and then for about 25 mins you can walk further to the other side of the beach and the old town.If you are after a quiet break in the sunshine i advise you go here out of season as when we went there were so many stag and hen dos in both the old town and the strip, I dread to think what it is like there in peak season.  The area is heavily catered towards Brits abroad with places where you can get English Breakfasts and watch Sky Sports so if this is not the type of holiday you want i would look at alternative Algarve destinations that are quieter such as Praia da Rocha or Villamoura.  On the whole though we had a good time, the apartment provided everything that we needed (comfortable sofa bed aside) and was a decent size",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,4

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Rome H G,40,Rome H Gwrote a review Jun 2018,"Portugal, Lisbon, its classic cable cars, interesting artistic architecture, color tiled facades and the 1908 Lisboa Boutique Hotel, \"you've got to see it.\"Lisbon is a beautiful city to escape whether it be a long weekend or a seven-day journey. Either way, it will be an adventure.Upon making my initial reservation through my well respected and talented team at Ultra Travel Service of Boston, I received a personalized welcome and thank you email from the hotel. (*UT)Subsequent emails were exchanged with Andre to familiarize me further with all amenities and any additional services or assistance I might need and to personalize my experience. (*UT)As requested, my private ride was arranged and waiting for me patiently as my flight was delayed for over an hour. (*UT)A short drive to the hotel where I was welcomed by three smiling staff members. (*UT)- Checking in was swift with Andre' personally there to greet me to the 1908 Lisboa. (*UT)The room in which I reserved was one of the best categories at this property and with a spectacular view. (*UT)This particular room is round with a great view from every angle with a spiral staircase leading to a second-floor seating area with a complimentary mini-bar, HD television, and a classic turntable with vinyl from the 80's classics. (*UT)The bathroom in itself was ginormous It had a huge glass enclosed shower, a soaking tub and a generous amount of local toiletries. (*UT)Within a few minutes, the door rings and in comes a bottle of Port, pralines, and the famously tasty Portuguese Pastel de Be'lem. (compliments of the management.) (*UT)The quaint bar located near the lobby has one of the most knowledgeable bartenders about Port Wine, history of Lisbon and local insight. (*UT)Dinner at \"INFAME\" was great, but I only wish the staff was a little more engaging and knowledgeable about the menu. Breakfast was served at the same restaurant with your typical breakfast fare on offer.The proximity to the city center and most of the tourist attractions are within walking distance. (*UT) Just next door to the 1908 Lisboa is \"A VIDA PORTUGUESA,\" a boutique department store that carries unique artistic pieces. (*UT)On one of the evenings, I received a surprise bottle of Port, from management, the same one I had told the bartender the night before I genuinely liked. (*UT)After every morning jog, I was handed a bottle of water and a face towel by the front staff. (*UT) Although a gym is not provided, being in such a beautiful city, why would you want to workout indoors?On one occasion I noticed two elderly couples that were lost asking Andre' for help in finding their hotel. Andre' not only assisted them with directions (in their native language of French) but contacted the hotel directly to tell them about their stranded guests and that they were on their way. (Way to go Andre')(*UT)On the morning of my departure, at 5 am, Andre' made the effort of being there personally to say goodbye,(*UT) as he had also prepared a breakfast box as to the early departure. (*UT)I chose this hotel with advice from my travel consultant, and I might add I was not disappointed in the least.I was indeed made to feel as though I was the only guest at this boutique hotel (*UT), artistic touches throughout, (*UT) a marvelous structure to admire from the street (*UT), and most importantly, a staff that treats you like an old friend(*UT).I will provide photos and videos of this journey and a link to property for anyone wishing to experience the adventure.As you will notice I'm using (*UNIQUE TOUCH- UT) throughout my writing as to express my personal feelings with my experience during a given journey. Because I consider myself a global citizen and a seasoned traveler who has an eye for fine details in life, I have created this check and balance to give recognition and credit where deserved.As I so famously say Goodbyes are never easy unless you reply with: \"see you soon.\"Uniquely the 1908 Lisboa touched me wholeheartedly numerous times and received 21 UNIQUE TOUCH stars * from Rome H Geragonis- I LOVE IT!",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,4

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Mr S,0,Mr Swrote a review Nov 2023,"It’s not a 5 star hotel, location is great, clean , rooms are great, food is ok but maybe because it’s a small hotel. BUT 5 stars hotel need to have sleepers and some personal things and they don’t, you need to ask for it. No concierge only front desk and they need some energy. I even took my luggage up the stairs because there was no one at the front at 20:00.Please people wake up",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,3
Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,hmbkatz,88,hmbkatzwrote a review Nov 2014,"First the good - These apartments are within walking distance of everything you would want to see in Porto.  The proprietress, Olivia, is very nice and wonderfully helpful.  The apartment was modern and very clean.  Now the downside - Our apartment slept six, but this worked only because we had two children who didn't mind sleeping on a sofa bed.  Six adults would not do well sharing this space.  Sharing one bathroom would be challenging too if you are not related - we were all family, so we made it work.  The hot water tank is small, so we had to be careful to stagger showers in order to share the hot water.  Truthfully, the upside far outweighed the downside and I would stay here again if I return to Porto.",Nov,2014,Nov 2014,2014-11-01,2014,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Stephen S,16,Stephen Swrote a review Mar 2018,"Our flight was cancelled so this airport was booked by the airline at no cost to us so I can't judge on the price, only on what Mariotte's usually cost at other places.  The passengers all arrived on a bus to register at once and the process by the two girls at the front desk was efficient and friendly.  They gave me a room with two beds at my request.  The only other positive was it was the most comfortable bed I've been in for a long time.  The troubles were when I wanted a wake up call for the morning.  They said that everyone from the shuttle bus would be woken up at the same time, one hour before it came.  I explained I had spent 8 hours sitting at the airport after a flight from the U.S. at which it took us 5 hours to get there.  We were exhausted and needed every minute to sleep before the next day.  We were unable to retrieve luggage from the airport so we had no new clothes or grooming supplies to use.  How much time would a person need to get ready?  One hour apparently.  Even though I finally talked the girl into writing down a wake up call time, we were still awakened out of deep sleep earlier than asked.  When I mentioned it to Ricardo in the morning, he came out to embarrass me in front of others in the lobby by repeatedly telling me it was their policy and I was wrong.  It's unbelievable that a person has no choice in what time to wake up at this facility.  The other big problem was that since we didn't get to our original destination hotel in Madrid, which was already booked, I wanted to contact them to let them know.  My wife and I do not own a cell phone so I wanted to use a computer to email them.  I was told that I would have to pay for minutes on the computer to use it.  I have been to the cheapest motels on the planet and they all have a computer to use.  We stayed at Novatel the next 3 nights and they had two for free use.  How can a place that charges so much, nickel and dime you to death?  We left before breakfast was served so can't comment on the contents.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,2
Vila Galé Albacora,LRS1957,2,LRS1957wrote a review Aug 2017,"Once more, been there July and August. Resort had improvements, got nicer. Good for families with small kids, or couples. Boat trip to the beach is relaxing and Terra Estreita beach delicious. This time a minus, as with full capacity some important details failed, better organization at breakfast and cleaning needed.Nevertheless a great time for holidays, with Tavira so close with so many places to eat and enjoy. Considering actual demand, sugest June and September.Yes, still recomend it strongly, as was there as a couple and with my son!Another important thing, when visiting Algarve: have a look at all cultural and musical programs for summer months, as you can enjoy a lot almost at no cost!Wish you all well.Luís Rebelo de Sousa",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Matt M,1,Matt Mwrote a review Sep 2022,"The hotel has a nice lobby, restaurant and pool area. Unfortunately that is the only bit of the hotel that reflects the Marriott standards. Often had to wait 15 minutes to get an elevator, room key failed to work on every occasion I returned to the room meaning another long wait for an elevator down, joining extremely long queues at reception then waiting for another lift back up. One trip took me 50 minutes before I was back in my room. They sent maintenance to look at the lock but it was not fixed. Whilst frustrating this could have been managed by the staff on reception however I was met with shrugging shoulders and blamed for keeping the key near my phone (which I did not do). The reception staff were extremely cold, unhelpful and unwelcoming.  Air conditioning in the room is extremely loud. Maintenance were sent twice to fix this and still not fixed. The club lounge is often over crowded so you lose all exclusivity. The balconies are just an empty space overlooking the dual carriageway.I live in hotels 10 out of the 12 months a year on business and have been in Lisbon for 3 months. There are much better hotels available in the area (e.g. the Sheraton). I would feel sorry for any holiday maker who books this hotel.I don’t take leaving a bad review lightly but on the last occasion my room key didn’t work the lady at reception muttered an insult in Portuguese at me under her breath. Clearly not aware that I have worked here for some time and could understand her this was the final straw and lead to me leaving this one star review.An extremely disappointing stay and I will be returning to the Sheraton for my remaining three months in Portugal.",Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,1

Slippers one pair male size, though our booking said clearly 2 females.  Ms Gouveia at desk  very offhand, querying whether we'd actually ordered taxi,  said office was closed would have to sort out in morning.  Next day she said there was no email specifying those details.  Luckily the following day when we had a copy of the email another very helpful girl was apologetic and refunded our excess fare.bathroom counter top was dirty throughout the stay and with no discernible extraction system. Room and kitchen well-equipped.  The glass dome over the entertainment lounge was just outside the door, so noisy at night.Poor Wifi.Trip could only be paid by cash.Very unpleasant smell outside entrance door.There were no obvious signs for stairs - an obvious safety hazard in case of fire or other emergency.  After searching on a couple of floors, I asked at the office and was shown a door along a corridor, which had no sign and did not look like a stairway for the public.I hope this has now been remedied and that other improvements have been carried out since our visit, which was a little before the date stated, as I have only just discovered this site.",Oct,2020,Oct 2020,2020-10-01,2020,2

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Pamela S,33,Pamela Swrote a review Feb 2015,"For the first time ever my husband and I decided to go away for Christmas. Having been in Albuferia twice before in September, and loved everything about it, we chose Forte do Vale to stay at this time. We picked a 1 bed self catering apt, and we were delighted to find it was massive and very well equipped (except for a spatula which we bought for a €1). Our apt (205) faced the front of the hotel but we didn't have any noise problems at all, maybe it was the time of year? As everyone else has said the reception staff are exceptional. We dealt mostly with Miquel and Gina and cannot praise them enough for their big smiles and friendly manner, not to mention their efficiency. Loved the bar, especially happy 2 hour, but found one of the bartenders to be a bit robotic. We like to have a bit of chat from those in the bar. Didn't try the restaurant, Flavours, this time but might do in September as we've already booked again!! This hotel is ideally placed between both sections of Albuferia although Old Town is a bit of a stretch to walk for us wrinklies. I loved my massage in the spa but do agree it's a bit tired looking in that area of the hotel, and unfortunately it was really cold in the therapy room! Maybe a revamp is on it's way as they are still updating parts of the hotel. Really had a brilliant time, can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,4

We did not eat at the hotel, preferring to make our breakfast in the room, the equipment provided was high quality, and eating in Funchal in the evening. The staff were all very friendly and efficient and the location is wonderful, a short walk/taxi ride into Funchal but far enough away to be quiet. It really is a very comfortable hotel. Our only disappointment was that the largest outdoor pool was too cold to use and the heated one only just warm enough on one afternoon during our stay - to be fair it was March. The indoor pool however was warm and never crowded. We are very happy to recommend this hotel.",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,4
Predicados do Douro Palace,Grace A D,31,Grace A Dwrote a review Jun 2019,"Stayed in this charming guesthouse , named so not because it is a palace but because it is across from Crystal Palace Gardens . The gardens are very beautiful with breathtaking vistas of the city and river. Roosters , ducks , peacocks are roaming through the grounds , a delight for children.This guesthouse has a lovely welcome from Bruno , along with refreshing drink ( water , port etc) It is a converted old house , old stone walls etc , WiFi not excellent . Location of guesthouse ideal , 10-15 min walk to Square with 4 Lions fountain . Numerous buses pass opposite , going into town . Bus to airport is 1 min walk , to the right as you exit and around the corner ( 601) costing 2 eu/ per person. Taxi from airport was 27 eu ( save money , take the 602 bus from airport , the stop is outside this guest house !Lovely high ceilinged rooms , some with verandahs . Good air con . Beds firm .Coffee + tea making facilities in the rooms ( and complimentary pastries )Lovely place to stay esp to have more authentic local experience",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,5

Pestana Viking,Alex N,11,Alex Nwrote a review Nov 2024,"We have just come back from a fabulous family holiday over October half term staying at Pestana Viking.Rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels each time - separate beach towels provided also which was fab!We had a sea view suit, nice clean room, lovely view. Pull out sofa bed in living area was a bit back breaking but the two queen beds in the main bedroom pushed together were fine for what we needed, also had sink & fridge as we were half board.Entertainment - there was a bar on site that had a singer a couple of times in the evening & they have a pool table with 3 other games.Food was amazing. José & his team were fabulous! Think I must have put on a stone in the week we were there!Sea pool outdoors was freezing as expected this time of year, indoor pool & hot tub were very slightly warmer but kids didn’t seem mind it. Nice sauna & steam room & nice little gym.Nice little head massage in the spa too, note to ask if they have any special offers on, I did & it saved me 30euros!Location was a bit sparse but did have a few little restaurants near by - the local Intermarché up the hill was fab for getting supplies. Stunning beaches on all sides. Nice bar up on the hill over looking the beach next to the church - take a seashell to add to the trees.Near by was Zoomarine which was amazing - we pre booked before coming as you can then book transport through their website to pick up directly outside of the hotel - for two days entrance it was £188 for family of 4, transport for 1 day was £40 there & back - we actually tried Uber for the second day & it was about £10 each way. If you only book 1day at Zoomarine too you can book an extra day for 10 euros each whilst there!Dolphin experience is cheaper to book once there too it cost us 97 euros each - this includes free professional picture with the dolphin, the experience itself, hire of wetsuit & a towel gift & bag.There are multiple boat companies if you want to try & find dolphins on the wild & see the caves - you can book at the beach next to Pestana viking resort (boat ride approx 1hr) or you can get a taxi (12euros approx) to the marina  where the bigger boats all launch from (most about 2hrs+) plus there are some nice restaurants here too to make a day of it.You can get a land train to the next village that runs in front of the hotel - reception can give you the pick up times etc. it’s about 5 euros each but is a nice little journey exploring with the family.Old town is very quaint & pretty too if you are looking for something other than the beach & is a little away up from the marina.All in all would go back again & had a lovely time. Thank you to all of the staff, you were amazing x x",Nov,2024,Nov 2024,2024-11-01,2024,4
Natura Algarve Club,Sarah D,6,Sarah Dwrote a review May 2024,"What an amazing hotel! From the moment we arrived until we left we felt welcomed and appreciated.Pool and pool area are clean and well maintained, the rooms have everything you need and the cleanliness is exceptional.Location wise itâ€™s perfect, nice little supermarket, bars and restaurants less than a minute walk.The main strip is a 5-10 minute walk away and you can walk to old town or get the little tourist train if youâ€™re brave enough.We had a great stay here with a little surprise by the lovely staff for my husbands bday which was really nice and much appreciated.Would definitely stay again if we were to come back.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,5
Natura Algarve Club,Sosuma,162,Sosumawrote a review Sep 2015,"We stayed in a pool view studio for 6 nights. For the price paid my expectations weren't too high but a couple of things were a bit of an inconvenience.  Firstly we did not have any issues with the staff, they were the best part of staying at this resort.  Celia was very friendly at check in and check out and even helped carrying my mothers heavy suitcase to our room. Claudia was great when dealing with our malfunctioning toaster and loss of electricity. She followed up with us the following day and was friendly and polite as well as efficient in acting on all our requests. Joao (maintenance) was also very friendly, replaced our toaster, got us an oven tray and had a great sense of humour. The staff made us feel comfortable and at ease. Unfortunately the hotel is dated and a few things need replacing. Our toilet flush did not work properly, our bathroom was very dated and had a cracked wash basin. The doors were damaged, the kitchen again very old and dated. Furniture looked newish but the television was very small with limited channels.  The pool area was nice. Wifi was fast in the reception area but you will need to hire a modem if you want access in your room. Parking is outdoors and plentiful, but not sure how busy it gets during summer.  There is a Intermarche supermarket close by, prices are very reasonable there.  The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Oura and Santa Eulalia beaches and 10 minutes from the restaurant 'strip'. I walked to the old town of Albufeira in about 30 minutes. It's 3km away. You can catch a bus or taxi easily if walking is not your thing. Would stay again but only because the staff were good. It's not their fault the rooms have not been renovated, this is something that management should address to avoid unnecessary complaints.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,3
Natura Algarve Club,david k,3,david kwrote a review Aug 2013,"This was a fantastic place to stay! Just back from a two week holiday.Hotel is situated perfectly just outside the new strip and only 25 min walk to old town.  Plenty of beaches within walking distance.  Staff super and always willing to help.For price paid this is a hidden gem.  Although rooms and amenities are worn everything works and is all you need.   Rooms spacious and comfortable.  Pool is not as cold as people say, it is naturally chilled.  Although be careful the bath and shower can be very slippy following being cleaned.  The rooms are clean and towels were changed regularly for us and beds made each day with sheets changed twice.  Outside can be noisy at night with people returning home however this is not the fault of the hotel!Good places to eat!! The county cockeral kitchen which is left of the supermarcado above the hotel. Really well priced and great tasting food especially from their 2 for 1 menu at Â£13.95 - can't beat it!! be sure to prebook your table it is that good!!!Paulu's italian is another lovely place to eat.There is a chinese on the new town strip on the right as you walk up with 4 euro specials great food!!",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,5
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,philap,81,philapwrote a review Sep 2019,In many ways this hotel was more than adequate situated as it between the Marina and the fishing port. It’s biggest plus is the quality of the staff who are friendly and helpful. One disappointment was the lack of food on arrival after a delayed Friday night flight and the inability to book a day room on the last day. We left at 6pm but had to clear our room at 1pm.The food is exceptionally good.,Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

Ocean Gardens,Milvert,84,Milvertwrote a review Sep 2008,"Much has been said about this hotel and believe me you will not be disappointed. The hotel is small but perfectly formed.The hotel is kept spotless and the views over Funchal are breathtaking.Taxi from the airport was 18 euros although the taxi booked through the hotel for the return journey said they had an agreement with the hotel to charge 30 euros. After negotiation this was reduced to 25 euros.As said by others the 10 to 15 minute ( white knuckle ride ) local bus journey into  Funchalis only 2 euros but for a couple on a 2 week holiday this cost 112 euros.  You can of course use the hotel courtesy bus ,which is far more civilised ,but the timetable is clearly designed to keep you in the hotel in the evening. The last bus back from Funchal is 6.30 p.m.This hotel is excellent value for money and being small has its advantages.  We met some lovely people who chatted freely at breakfast,around the pool and in the restaurant and bar.Tommy and Maureen and Pat and Russell will miss the fun.Yvette from Switzerland will miss practicing her English.Adelaide serving the breakfast was so pleasant and keen to help.The hotel restaurant is good and we particularly liked Estrela Do Mar in the Old Town.  Sabor da India at the Lido provided a pleasant change with fine Indian Cuisine.This hotel provides a wonderful base from which to explore Madeira.",Sep,2008,Sep 2008,2008-09-01,2008,4

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,alexandraellies,13,alexandraellieswrote a review Aug 2016,"Our room was extremely disappointing, particularly as we had paid 3 adult rates. We were given a double room and a \"camp bed\", which quite frankly for an adult in a supposed 4 star hotel is not ideal at all.The air con I had already read previously on Trip Advisor was not efficient, but ours was positively dangerous as well.It kept us awake by the electrical tripping noises it kept making and it kept spewing out either chunks of ice or water that wet the floor underneath.One night there was a power cut on our corridor, possibly as a result of the air con.We reported it at Reception and an engineer supposedly attended but it didn't improve,We recorded it on the phone and played it to the holiday rep but she wasn't unduly concerned.Cleaning also left a lot to be desired. the room was never cleaned before 5.30 pm and on the last day we were packing at about 5.50 pm when the maid arrived. We went to the lounge to leave her to do her job but when we returned the only cleaning that had been done was the beds being made,The bathroom hadn't been touched and the floors were unmopped.The reason for this was that there were still 2 or 3 rooms near ours still to be cleaned.Cleaning still taking place at this time prevents guests from getting ready for their evening meal, which is far from ideal.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,2

Pestana Viking,Jenny P,20,Jenny Pwrote a review Jun 2017,"We stayed here 31 may-7th June. First impressions, hotel needs a good overhaul as furnishings and some areas dated and in need of a paint. We were in room 711 and the air conditioning did not work at all. We complained three times to reception who said Maintenance would check it out. Well I think like other things, this needs an overhaul too as our room was so warm even leaving the key card in the slot all day and night, our room was still warm. I hardly slept because of this! It annoys me when hotels state they have air con But when you arrive it just doesn't work!! In spite of this th staff are friendly, the buffet breakfast is good apart from the coffee, it's from a machine and full of sugar whatever one you choose!! The outdoor pool area is great, plenty of sun beds and no one putting towels on beds and reserving them from early dawn thank goodness. Because of the air con and dated areas I've marked 3 out of 5 but if you like a hot room then this isn't a bad hotel for a weeks break.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,2

In the central area of Viseu, equidistant and close to the Rossio and Sé, there is another beautiful guesthouse from Portugal. Born from the recovery of a hospital, the closed cloisters are imposing, marked a central zone that gives access to various services, including the Bar on the central ship. If you can, stay in the rooms on the 4th floor, with large balconies, namely those that make the corner of the building.  They are spacious rooms, with imposing double bed and living room partition as a front chamber. The dark wood gives it a special beauty, with wide windows that give it plenty of lighting. They have a good spa and gym, with an outdoor pool for guest service. A good buffet breakfast, with regional products, where there was no shortage of the Viriato and the Bolo Real and the good cheese. The guesthouse has a private parking lot and an outdoor pool, which given the time of year we did not experience. As is customary in the guesthouses, but it is worth mentioning, a friendly and attentive staff, from the reception to the maids.
