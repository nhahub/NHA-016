Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Katherine N,3,Katherine Nwrote a review Aug 2022,"Staff are fantastic and helpful.Pools are all great especially for kids.  Few slips but thats water on tiles.  Slides are popular also.Daytime entertainment team are brilliant with the younger kids but my older girls (11ys and 13yrs) werent interested in much they did.Few areas needing massive improvementSome nights the evening meal queues were terrible....worst thing is can see empty tables and were told restaurant was full.Evening entertainment really not good... the daytime team do their absolute best and hats off to them its a long bloody day but to class this hotel as 4 star plus they should have a far better stage/seating area and hire better evening entertainmentNo outdoor seating areas for just a sit and relax. There are 8 tables mainly used by smokers near the restaurant.The hotel corridors are bare and bland and the carpets are badly stained.Good points/Nice TouchesRooms are lovely spacious and cleanFree bottled water provided in rooms and coffeeBottled water provided at meal times waiter service for drinksLots of sunbeds...still some spare most daysSeperate quiet pool big fun pool and baby pool and splash parkFood is a plenty, usual buffet style but always fresh and dining area kept cleanLocation not great but taxis available from hotel and mini bus 8 x per day free to beach and backShame about people who leave a mess behind but staff always trying to ensure keep up with tidyingCan organise trips from the hotel which is handý we did the caves and dolphins boat ride and it was fantastic.Overall we had a good time was just disappointed especially with what it cost.",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Matthew K,9,Matthew Kwrote a review Aug 2022,"Currently on holiday here. Would definitely not recommend it unfortunately. The whole place needs a overhaul, from the swimming pool to the rooms. The floor tiles in the pool are coming away. The amount of people in here the place isn't designed for it. Filmed the dinner que last night, was in it 56 minutes in total. This isn't fair on the kids. The place is filthy to be straight, toilets are disgusting, the floors are the same, stair carpet is on another level. The most upsetting thing I personally find is the staff never ever smile, never speak, they just don't want to be here. I can honestly say aswell, ive nevef seen as many kids in the medical centre. If Jet2 have any idea of what's going on in here I'm sure they'd be pulling out. Big shame on the management, I would not recommend at the chance and will certainly not be returning. Will submit pictures on return.",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,1

Villas Barrocal,BRRM,73,BRRMwrote a review Nov 2012,"We stayed at Villas Barrocal for 12 days in mid October and although the weather was poorer than usual at this time it did not dampen our view of these  peacefully situated VillasAs others have said a car is a near essential if you are staying here!Situated in the small village of Pera, not to be confused with the high rise eyesore of Armacao de Pera ,(about a 40 minute walk away)Pera is a quiet village with not much going on ,but it is pleasant to wander the alleys and old streets for an hour or twoBe sure to visit Tasquinho De Joao(apologies for the spelling) a restaurant run by a very pleasant lady, her daughters and a French lady cook, the food is excellent, especially the Suckling Pig on Sundays,  the portions are enormous and its very inexpensive. If you meet Paulo a chatty local at the restaurant ,don`t forget to buy him a beer, he`s a real nice guyThe Villas are spotless ,cleaned every other day with linen changes each time, The beds are large and firm  and the whole apartment is very spacious and comfortableAndrea ,the receptionist and all the other staff are unobtrusive and very efficientThere is a 20 metre long pool ,also spotless, but take goggles !The Villas are a little out of the way but if you want peace this may be ideal for youI`m sure we would be happy to return next time we go to the AlgarveIf you go,to Villas Barrocal the Praia Grande beach is about 3 Km from Pera and has miles and miles of beatiful sand to walk on, oh and  if you google\" save salgados\" you can sign a petition to stop  the beach and the salt flats and bird sanctuary from being developed",Nov,2012,Nov 2012,2012-11-01,2012,4

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Sim C Stack,29,Sim C Stackwrote a review Sep 2018,"Arrived at the Belmar last Wednesday. Marcus at reception was dealing with us. I will start by saying this employee should not be allowed to be in a customer service role. He was clearly annoyed by the previous guests upset due to the taxi strike. The woman was close to tears, he could have easily advised her of the Uber option but clearly his local taxi friends are more important than the guests who stand in front of him upset!. He is extremely arrogant...at one point when looking for a credit card for the security deposit he did not as much as look at us. He is a rude manner said “CARD”!. No please or thank you. He could tell I was appalled!. I asked for the front office managers name, he proceeded to tell me “Carlos” and then in a very threatening manner asked do I want to speak to him!. I declined and then when Carlos did come out to reception he then tried to intimidate me again by asking there he is!. I will not tolerate any such behavior from any employee. This man needs to be removed from the reception team. I can see Carlos has his work cut out for him dealing with this man!. I am in the hotel industry myself, and if any of our employees ever treated a guest like that...I can assure you it would be dealt with. I will be getting onto the Hotel Group to advise of the above as I can see from previous reviews and over hearing other guests that the staff morale is so poor. This does not include the lovely restaurant staff. It’s such a pity for front of house to be so rude as it’s the heart of the hotel and has honestly confirmed I will not be returning here due to this appalling customer service I experienced.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,1
Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,gili1963,154,gili1963wrote a review Oct 2013,"On our way in the Douro valley, I was getting drunk. From the mosaic terraces of vineyards. Purring down from the mountains, that creates deep valleys, ending in the Douro River. that is part of the oldest wine way in the world. I could feel the great heritage of this region, that was crowned as UNESCO site, while passing endless challenging curves in the road.Our aim was getting before sunset to Quinta Nova. The first wine hotel in Portugal. An old 18 century manor house, divided to 11 rural stylish rooms. I didn’t know what to expect as in our way, I saw dozens of Quintas with inviting decorated gates. The narrow corridor to the house was adorned with a fence of pink ivy.Mrs. Paula Sousa, was waiting to make us, a small introduction tour. She is the lady of the manor, that belongs to Amorim family, that is well known in the cork world industry.my room had a part of the breathtaking view, that has a mesmerizing light in sunset. That played hot colors on the slopes of the grapes and the pool, that has an edge, that looks as continuation of the north bank of the river, so blue water merges more blue.I was so excited, from the fact the nature around, revealed many great spots. I was running around with my camera, against time that was shading the skies. In every outdoor detail, I felt the artistic attention.inside the manor, it was like watching a private collection. of best pieces of paintings, furniture, assecories, rare items that could be in a museum. I took my time to spot around, and appreciate what other guests just pass by.The organic garden behind, grows all the supply for the hotel restaurant.I met the smiling chef picking a huge pumpkin, he was preparing as soup for dinner. There are trails going around and also down, to the river. in a total circuit of 17 km, that spread between 5 different routes. Great exercise, and there is also an option for having a guide for a Nordic walk, or hire a bike and challenge your stamina. By the way it's also a bike hotel, so there is a garage to keep them repair and wash if needed.The place has a very modern winery. i bought one of the great wines they produce, sold in the  gourmet shop. It was an elegant one, strong in character and freshness. As all the region, is about wine tourism, so the place offers participating in the harvest, wine tasting, wine making and eco-tourism, that differs in seasons.A baroque chapel, is part of the domain. quite surprising but the place needed in old times, its saint. To pray that she (senhora do carmo) will protect the transporters, while sailing with barrels of wine, in the river below. the vast orchards of the quinta, demonstrate at best, the local tradition and authenticity of the region.I'd love to spend in this quinta, a romantic weekend, with the perfect match, for this perfect place.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,4
Dixo's Oporto Hostel,Emily M,2,Emily Mwrote a review Jul 2015,"6-Bedroom female dorm room was lovely with big windows opening out onto a great view of Porto. Respectful other travelers. The check-in desk staffers, particularly Pedro (!) had GREAT recommendations of things to do - places to see. I was picked up at the hostel for both the tour and pub crawl which was very convenient. Rooftop has fantastic view. Have stayed in MANY hostels and this one is at the top for coziness and cleanliness.  The location is also PERFECT - right near bars, restaurants, and the beautiful riverfront.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,5
Holiday Inn Express Lisbon - Oeiras By IHG,roger m,260,roger mwrote a review Sep 2018,"You use this place if you need to get to the airport early the next day.  They have a shuttle service every 20 minutes (with a silly 4 euro charge), and it's only 10-15 minutes away.  Rooms are fine in a modern, US type accommodation.  The restaurant has a rather captured clientele, and serves some of the worst food I had in 5 months in Europe on its fixed menu.  Try to eat somewhere else (not so easy, given the hotel location).",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,3
Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,Sarah603,0,Sarah603wrote a review Nov 2017,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights when traveling for vacation.  Our 2 bedroom apartment was clean, quiet, comfortable.  It was very nice and in an excellent location. Olivia met us immediately upon arrival and ensured our stay was very comfortable-she recommended tours and made restaurant reservations.  Rui helped us before arriving by arranging our rental car and its drop off.  They also arranged airport transfer.  There was no street noise despite being very centrally located and in a great location.  It was a great visit.  The only downside was having to pay cash (or manage a bank transfer) but this was insignificant compared to the wonderful service and excellent lodging we had.  Also, the price is unbeatable for what you get.....amazing actually that such a nice place was so reasonably priced.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,4

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,mrshd,5,mrshdwrote a review Sep 2009,"as we were booking our honeymoon we looked for ages for a lovely hotel, we could get to from Bristol easily and was within our budget.  We hit upon Estalagem Ponta do Sol and took a risk and booked it up.  Another reviewer on this website mentioned beware of overbooking and a week before we were due to arrive we got an email saying they were overbooked for the first night and would we mind staying somewhere else - we did mind, and said that, and then it was no problem.  This is the only negative with our experience.The hotel picked us up at the airport, and took us back to Ponta do Sol.The hotel was fantastic, really light, airy, secluded, beautiful (if you like bauhaus architecture) there were lots of wonderful places to relax, an honesty bar, good food, great staff, in fact i'd rate it as one of the best places we've stayed.  The area around is a bit lacking, but the hotel offer free shuttle buses so you can get to funchal for trips out.  6 out of the 7 days though, we just relaxed around the pool.  On the last night there was a horrendous 'soft rock' festival in the town so we high tailed it to The Vine Hotel, in Funchal - its definately worth a visit, over double the price and gimicky (there's a switch you press to close the curtains, etc.) its got an amazing roof top pool and spa, but I have to say I dont think it was worth over double the price of Ponta do Sol.",Sep,2009,Sep 2009,2009-09-01,2009,4

Four Seasons Fairways,Linda W,38,Linda Wwrote a review Aug 2013,"So good to return to Fairways and see the familiar faces of all the lovely staff.  Whenever we return there is always something new in the villa, this year being brand new patio slabs and bbq area together with revamped tiled seating area too.  The resort truly is first class and kept so wonderful.  The addition of the little complimentary shuttle bus to the beach was also an excellent addition and very welcomed.  The chef in the restaurant at Fairways is absolutely top class and quite honestly after having 3 weeks going to lots of terrific restaurants in the area at Quinta da Lago I wished I had eaten at Fairways more often, the food was absolutely divine.  We love every minute of our holidays at Fairways and only wish I could afford to stay longer.  If anyone of you are in any doubt as to whether to buy a week or more at Fairways, Quinta da Lago, then don't hesitate, you will never regret it.",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,5
Casa Mitchell Apartments,lfc197758,3,lfc197758wrote a review Aug 2023,This hotel is ideal if you want a peaceful holiday it is very outdated but it is clean and the staff are very nice and helpful. The pool area is cleaned daily but make sure you get down at 7.30 to claim a bed. There a nice cafe opposite which is cheap and serves a nice breakfast. The location was a bit hilly for me but the week we went they were getting temps of over 40 degrees which didnt help.

Four Seasons Fairways,spiderlegs,6,spiderlegswrote a review Aug 2013,"Four Seasons always feels like a return home.  We share 7 weeks of ownership with my sister and visit once, sometimes twice a year.  Compared with many owners this is not that often.  However we are always greeted like family.  It is genuine and not scripted or imposed on the staff.  They just care.  Where else could you walk into a bar 16 months after your last visit for  Neuno on the bar to shake your hand, greet you by name and ask  \"gin & slimline and a small beer??\" before you have opened your mouth.  Yes he remembered that I had changed last time from full fat tonic to slimline!!!!The atmosphere is relaxed yet there is an attention to detail that means you are getting the service you pay for and it is very rare indeed we find fault..  The introduction of free wi fi in the villas and a shuttle bus that saves the hefty car parking charges at the glorious beaches are examples of the improvments that continue to be rolled out. and are appreciatedMy only asks would be a little more entertainment in the bar because very often when there has been entertainment when we pop up for pre-dinner drinks we have enjoyed it and it results in us staying at Four Seasons rather than going out into Quinta to eat.   I would love a less firm matress but my husband disagrees!A special hello and thank you to Fritz....He will know why!",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,4

No not really, it's like having an advert saying eat as much as you like, but with old fashioned English grace. No shorts, t shirts trainers, ladies were dressed up. Really superb if you have an hour or so to kill. Warning you do need to book in advance.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,5

The staff are simply wonderful, very friendly and professional, we had a beautiful room on the top floor, the rooms are simply stunning, we received a WhatsApp from the reception and told we could ask them to help us with reservations etc, it was a great feature to use during our stay and the hotel made several reservations for us, every one was exceptional and a trip to the Grahams port house, well worth a trip.The breakfast is simply fabulous, I enjoyed champagne for breakfast daily and one morning breakfast to the room for my birthday, it was simply wonderful served with a candle and happy birthday message. I love the fact that breakfast is served until 11:15am each day, allows you to enjoy some rest in the morning after all you are on holiday and it was nice to relax. The breakfast selection is so good, I had to try and save room to enjoy a late lunch as the restaurant choice in Porto is utterly amazing, we also enjoyed my birthday meal at Blind Restaurant in the basement of the hotel and it was magnificent. We had a truly wonderful time and this hotel stay really made the trip, thank you to all the staff, such a wonderful hotel.",Nov,2022,Nov 2022,2022-11-01,2022,5

We both found a few in our beds, and the bathroom had SO many . We did report it (twice) and housekeeping used a spray. That helped, but they really needed to fumigate. We were also offered a different room, but well in to our stay, and only one bed. We needed two, for sure.The other issue was the bathroom. Very small, no privacy, as the door was made of mostly frosted glass., and faced the beds. 😂 no counter space either.On the other hand…it was a wonderful satisfying breakfast every day, the resort was clean and quiet , as it is adult only. We met some nice people from all over the world. The staff were all so nice! Was a great location for all the walking we did, but not close to very many restaurants. We didn’t mind, but if you’re not fit…this area is not for you!Cheers…Joanne and Barb",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,3

The hotel does not provide evening meals but there is a restaurant next door. Tua is a very small village, the railway station is directly opposite the hotel. It is very quiet and peaceful and is served by 5 trains a day. Train journeys are spectacular so get your camera ready!

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Columbus42,9,Columbus42wrote a review Jun 2016,"First visit to the Crown Plaza, we usually stay at the Tivoli but for this short weekend break we picked the CP because it was cheaper, but after falling for the sea view suite upsell when we checked in I think we paid the same price in the end. We had an early flight so arriving at the hotel at 9:30am the fact the upgraded room was available to check into sold it for me. Room and hotel perfect, facilities and staff. Yes it is further to walk to the Marina, but take a short cut through the car park area once on the main road and you soon hit the Marina area. My only negative comment is the 30min sunbed policy which left us without poolside sunbeds after we went for lunch - yes leave your sunbed unattended for 30mins and your towels could be removed! While I personally welcome such a policy the hotel reception staff should make you aware of it at check in. It certainly wasn't consistently maintained in our experience and the usual towel placement sunbed reservations at 8am was evident - no towels removed then! Don't let this put you off, if you know about it the hotel is excellent, plenty of space and clean, very modern rooms. Tip, if you have a late flight ask to get a shower and changed in the spa on the lower ground floor - excellent facilities again.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4

But they were all good, and a mention to the manager who's name I don't have and who we never met for helping us out with a couple of problemsIf you are after the quietest of holidays, you could walk about 500m from the apartments and eat in a different bar every night and some very good ones too.But if you chose these apartments and from our experience you can't go wrong!Room 122 and I have my free bar of soap with me as a souvenir",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Mr A,54,Mr Awrote a review Jun 2022,"The arrival should have set the alarm bells running as there was a very disgruntled customer asking for a refund. Where do we start with the hotel a â‚¬100 deposit for the rooms and my brother had to pay â‚¬70 for a cot for his daughter. The room appeared ok on initial impression but not what the photos show. The AC wasnâ€™t working so we reported this  seven times (over the phone, in person to reception, to the customer service mangers and then eventually to the Jet2 rep). A maintenance guy come out and said yes itâ€™s not working and a portable AC was required. None was received so another visit to reception. Eventually after 4 days a unit was provided was constantly leaked water causing a mayor slip hazard on the tiled floor. This was reported again with no follow up. We were eventually offered the money back for the cot plus a complimentary meal. Every visit to reception I witnessed people complaining with one occasion a couple moving room for the third time in three days. To have the money for the cot refunded I needed to sign to say I would not make a claim. Every night there was music blasting with stag and hen parties fuelling up on the all inclusive booze. Definitely donâ€™t visit if you are going as a family as this is not family hotel. Generally the hotel is tired. I received an electric shock from a vending machine and reported to a manager. Walked past 10 minutes later and it was still on. The rooms were only cleaned once in the week. Reported to reception and the cleaner come to the room at 7pm when we were having dinner and never returned. Lucia was helpful but it took to long to speak with her and to many visits to have any issues resolved. Olga the Jet2 rep was amazing.",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,1
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Itpbob,4,Itpbobwrote a review Oct 2017,"A lovely hotel in a great location.  When we arrived the check in process was efficient and friendly, and we were lucky enough to be given an upgrade to a junior suite which was sea-facing.  The room was excellent, very comfortable and good facilities.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food - we were half board, and each night the buffet was changed sufficiently to not become boring (Salmon at breakfast would have been nice though).  I also particularly enjoyed the selection of Portuguese gin in the light and airy lobby bar!  There were, however, 2 disappointing aspects of this hotel - the state of the loungers by the pool and the supply of beach towels.  Many of the loungers were damaged, stained and ripped, some beyond usability, which made what was already a shortage of loungers a dire situation after about 8am - particularly as the \"no reserving\" rule was ignored and not enforced.  The towel supply was strictly limited to one per person, which only covered around 2/3rds of the lounger, and given the state of the mattresses was unacceptable.  I hope there is an improvement to this for next year, as we would like to return but this would put us off.Generally though a pleasant stay with (apart from the towel attendants....) lovely staff.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,3
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Silentpunter,38,Silentpunterwrote a review Jul 2017,"Just returned after a 4 night stay. On the whole this is a nice hotel, but...Attention to detail needs to be a little better at this price. We upgraded upon arrival to a beach front suite, price quoted: an additional €285 an extra €71.25 a night, (making this Top dollar for an hotel in the area regardless of star rating)we agreed, and then were told the price was a mistake, and it was in fact €300. The experience then somewhat soured for the sake of an extra €15 - in my business an error like this would have been put down to experience, I certainly wouldn't ask the customer for extra money of that value if it were my mistake. Anyway, room was nice, not sure about the glass wall to the bathroom, but there's a blind available to maintain modesty for those not wishing to be visible whilst using the toilet! Bar prices are eye -wateringly expensive, drink elsewhere! Staff - well, a few still remember how to smile, the majority however, do not, and are pretty miserable, I get the impression it's perhaps not the best place to work. Finally this hotel suffers badly from towel on sunbed  at 5am disease, virtually all sun beds are 'claimed' by breakfast, I find this infuriating - good hotels don't allow it and ensure space at the pool is allocated fairly - why not here?So in summary, ok, but not good value for money, loads of room for improvement.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

Hotel do Parque,John,107,Johnwrote a review Jun 2014,"Hotel do Parque on the top of Bom Jesus is reached by hairpin narrow bends but worth the effort. This is a group of three hotels very recently (we were only the third set of occupants) refurbished and completely different to what we were expecting from various websites. They are all very designer chic, now apparently owned by some middle-eastern  millionaire who turned up in the breakfast room with his very gorgeous lady one morning, looking quite out-of-place. The impression on first going into our enormous bedroom under the eaves was wow! But then the practicalities of actually staying in the room kicked in. The cupboard under the slanting eaves was divided by three doors and wasnâ€™t tall enough to hang a dress up full length, and there was no wardrobe or chest of drawers, even though there was space enough for them. The adjoining toilet and shower both have opaque glass doors but no shelves or facilities within the shower itself, so ablutions had to be finished off in full view of other occupant. (Not very desirable if you are sharing with a friend!)The very large bed side lamps were black or dark gray with dim bulbs - totally useless for reading in bed so the shades had to be slung over the corner of the bed head to tilt them. Air conditioning seemed to be warming the room not cooling it even the one outside in the corridor was freezing every time one passed it. The building is on a bit of a steep location so when the hotel side and back doors are locked the haul up to the main entrance can be a bit of a trial.I am sure these admittedly small annoyances will be sorted out as the hotel gets into gear under its new management. Free Wifi available only in the foyer was a bit odd as was the fact that only breakfast was available in our hotel and dinner had to be taken in the one next door. The setting is spectacular with superb views over the city with the most amazing sunsets.",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,4
Pestana Viking,A R A,8,A R Awrote a review Mar 2015,"Stayed at the Pestana Viking resort at the beginning of March '15 and thought overall our experience was above average. We came expecting a Superior Room with a sea view and although the room was ok the sea view was marginal and faced north east so not much sun in prospect. In the event I asked for an alternative and payed a little extra for another room south facing with a balcony taking the sun most of the day (Room 529). The sun shone almost cloudlessly every day for a week - really, really nice. We hired a car and toured. Fantastic shopping at Algarve Shopping only 15 mins away by car. Food not expensive, quality great most of the time. This is our first visit to Portugal and will probably not go back to the Canaries (love there too) now that we have experienced this place. The hotel was really good; very clean; slightly tired in parts; staff excellent and very helpful. I would definitely consider returning here.",Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,4
Ocean Gardens,MarySurfing,4,MarySurfingwrote a review Dec 2018,"A real disappointment I am afraid. The rooms are old with heavy furniture that make much noise, the doors to the balcony are also old and you hear everything that is happening on the outside (traffic noise), as if they were open. Also you hear what happens in other rooms like people walking and doors sliding. You have to pay extra for the safe and no kettle in the room which is something common in even smaller hotels. In general the rooms are not worthy for a 4* hotel.From the way people were writing about the breakfast, I thought they would offer at least pasteis de nata! But no, it is basic, blunt taste, watery eggs, canned mushrooms, no green salad, horrid coffee, an overall disappointment.The pool is too cold to swim in, although the view is nice.We were unlucky because the internet in rooms was down during our whole stay. It's a pity that not even that could not be guaranteed.The staff are nice and try but the hotel should really either downgrade or become a lot cheaper!!",Dec,2018,Dec 2018,2018-12-01,2018,2

The rooms are a decent size and our bathroom looked quite new; we had a balcony overlooking the pool. The pool area can get quite busy, even in April when we were there. The pool water was pretty cold but quite a few hardy souls ventured in.We see little point in eating anything other than breakfast at the hotel given the many reasonably-priced restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The breakfast buffet offered a decent selection though it was worth keeping your eyes open for the arrival of fresh supplies of fried eggs and bacon.The staff seemed pleased to help, though never in a hurry.Two tips. There is a free public car park next to the hotel if you don't wish to pay the hotel's parking charge.

We stayed in the one bedroom apartment which was spacious, comfortable, well-decorated and private with a lovely large, airy bathroom and a private terrace.  Lots of nice touches such as a pretty flower arrangement when we arrived, plentiful thick towels including face flannels and huge beach towels, ice trays, a cool bag for picnics, books, lots of crockery and cutlery (not just 'two of everything') and so on.The property was very pretty and very well situated, completely in the countryside but near to a little village and only 10 minutes' drive from all the shops and restaurants in Lagos.  There was a lovely pool (this would have benefited from one of those automatic pool-cleaners) with plenty of sun loungers and, although we were without children, there was brilliant provision for children in the shape of a playground, toys, and a large shaded area where they could play in the heat of the day.Breakfasts on our private terrace were a treat, as were our two dinners, with Julio and Jill extremely kind and friendly hosts, providing lots of chat, laughter and companionship but also respecting our privacy.

Staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and were incredibly patient and helpful with our many questions, including some anxious times around flight cancellations. Ocean Gardens  is located outside the city centre but this wasn't an issue for us at all as the hotel operates a fixed and free shuttle bus into and from the city centre, which is very handy (but must be booked in advance). Otherwise bus connections are also excellent, with a bus stop immediately outside the hotel and staff helpfully supplying you with the timetable. If you are hiring a car there are ample parking spaces and the city centre is only about a 10 minute drive away, and we were given good tips on where to park in town. We tried a lot of the facilities including the pool, sauna, room service and restaurant/bar and were happy with everything. The gardens are maintained beautifully and are a joy to behold. I would say that some of the decor and fittings are a bit faded but this didn't matter really, as our room was spacious, the bed very comfy and the views absolutely stunning.

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Karuthers,158,Karutherswrote a review Feb 2012,"My wife and I had an excellent stay at The Altis Belem. This is a design hotel which manages to feel welcoming rather than challenging (as is often the case). Not everything was perfect (no hooks for outdoor coats and only Nespresso hot drinks @ 3.50 Euros a shot) but our room was light, warm, clean and well equipped. We followed a previous Tip and asked for an African room which meant we got light colours and crisp white bed linens and towels. Breakfast was excellent  and the evening meals were OK . In the gourmet restaurant everything was realy fine but only the oysters in lime foam  really stood out as a unique plate. The spa is smallish but wonderfully calm and relaxing. We made sure that we got back in good time  every day  to assure ourselves of at least an hour in the spa and the fully envelopping robes provided in the rooms mean you don't feel foolish getting changed in your room and plodding down the corridors into a dedicated lift (which helpfully doesn't stop at the public ground floor on the way bsack up from the spa). The location is west of centre but Belem has many of Lisbon's major historic attractions and the best pasteis shop. We found that it is about a 15 minute walk down to Belem station then 7 minutes on the train to the centre at a cost of less than 2 Euros each way.  A couple of touristy tips are that entry to the famous Belem Monastery is free on Sunday Mornings though you have to wait until after Mass to see the church and the Sao Roque church and museum in Lisbon centre are genuinely wonderful and unique.Back to the hotel, we can't speak highly enough of the staff who were friendly, attentive and helpful at all times. This applies to reception, housekeeping, restaurant, bar and spa staff in equal measure - not often you feel you can say that !",Feb,2012,Feb 2012,2012-02-01,2012,4

Cleaning of the rooms irreproachable.The negative: the hotel parking, paid at 12€ per day. It's just a nightmare. Parking or taking the car out of the park is always a challenge and the probability of taking a pillar back is very high. To improve the scenery, the owner of the restaurant next door parks his cart to cover all visibility, making the entrance to the busy avenue an authentic Russian roulette. The hotel has notoriously a problem with ants, the room is infested with ants. Being a 4-star hotel I do not understand how there is no restaurant and even the pool bar nor menu has to eat anything. To eat, just leaving the hotel. If it wasn't for Rita to unravel something, it would have been much worse.Breakfast, well, the space is tiny, the guests sitting on top of each other and the queues occupying the small and narrow passage spaces. There's little diversity, just the basics. A 4-star deserved a cake, a donut, a churro, I know, something beyond the basics. I highlight the good quality of the orange juice.The hotel Wi-Fi works in spaces, now very well, now does not work.It should be noted that the closest beach to the hotel is a non-concession beach (Amado beach), that is, those who want a bar, toilet, sun loungers have to move to other beaches.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,2
Hotel dos Templarios,lajacobspnr,44,lajacobspnrwrote a review Sep 2017,We very much enjoyed our stay here at the Hotel dos Templarios.  It's conveniently located to the city center and a 5 minutes drive to the Knights Templar Convent of Christ.   This was one of the best historic sites we have seen,Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,5
