Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,beckylx,2,beckylxwrote a review Sep 2023,"I cannot write into words the past 10 days we’ve just had what a sensational hotel with amazing staff who go above and beyond for all. My 4 year old son is at an age where he’s constantly on the go and always needs something to do to do keep him occupied. There was so many activities everyday he participated in, we felt at ease and comfortable from the minute we entered the lobby. The reception staff are so helpful and really want to you to have a great stay. But there really aren’t enough words to say or describe our holiday.  We’re heartbroken to be leaving, as we’re leaving with heavy hearts but we will definitely be returning to the Jupiter albufeira hotel, Thank you so much again from the bottom of our hearts from me and my family.",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Ebony J,2,Ebony Jwrote a review Jun 2025,"Where do I begin… Staff - LOVELY!! Hotel, 5 Stars in maybe a motel 6 kind of way? This is NOT luxury. It is nice hotel if you like budget friendly vibes, but its not luxury. There is NO decor in the rooms, really felt like a closet with a bed. My AC was out my entire stay. I have 5/6 people in my room trying to figure it out. They did not want to offer compensation even tho it was 85+ degrees during my stay. Room service is not included in the all inclusive. There flies and bugs everywhere in my room. I did not get my money’s worth. The pools close too early - like 6. The bars close early. The breakfast is repetitive and there is NO cook to order options. The “Top Shelf” drinks are very much not top shelf. Yes I upgraded to Inclusive Plus. Just - No. I wish I could have my money back - its not worth it. My towels were stained on multiple occasions. The mini bar is soda and beer. Not the kind of mini bar I am use to at a luxury resort. The pools arent heated. The shuttle ends too early. There is NO HOT TUB on premises. Just. No. Not luxury. False advertisement if you are looking for or use to luxury. Cute for a quick family beach trip but not a luxury vacation. NO.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,2

Vila Gale Nep Kids,Catarina Dias,1,Catarina Diaswrote a review Jun 2024,"Hotel aimed at children with plenty of activities and entertainment for them.Staff very committed to the entertainment and fun of the little ones. Children love it.I was on half board and the price was fair for the meals eaten there.Although the children love it, as a hotel it leaves a lot to be desired.As the reception is in the same space as the meals, it becomes very noisy and smells of food. The rooms only had shampoo, shower gel and a cap, which falls short of a hotel that charges a lot per day.I had the notice to clean the room posted on the door since 7:30 in the morning and it was 5pm and no one had arrived yet, which complicates things because everyone has children in that hotel and they need to use the room several times.In the restaurant there is no identification of the food, just an indication at the entrance of the restaurant but we don't know what is what, not to mention that it does not contain information about allergens, it fails in all the restaurants in the Vila Galé chain and so we already suggest changing it. that.For those who have food allergies, like my daughter, I always have to ask what is in it. But all of Vila Galé has this issue…..",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Chets77,78,Chets77wrote a review May 2012,"We returned last week from a 7 night stay at the Belmar, in one of their 2 bedroom touristic apartments, and I must say we had a fabulous time.Overall the hotel and apartments are excellent, and as the other reviewers have mentioned, the apartments are full kitted out with all mod cons, dishwasher, washing machine, oven/grill, etc. We had a flat screen TV showing all the main english terrestrial channels, with the added bonus of Sky Sports also. The apartments and hotel are all fairly new, hence in very good condition. The only slight negative about the service was that we were told that because we were staying in an apartment, as opposed to the hotel, we were only entitled to maid service once for the entire weeks stay. I think this is ridiculous for a family of 5 including 2 children, however, reception did correct this and was did get maid service upon request.The hotel was fairly quiet and peaceful for most of our stay, and there was usually plenty of room pool side. Like the other reviewer commented the out door jacuzzi was out of order, which was a little frustrating, however, we had full use of the Turkish bath and sauna, as well as the in-door heated pool, which was great for the kids, as the our door pools are still rather chilly at this time of year.We had breakfast included for our stay, and it was lovely, you could order hot items, eggs, sausages, bacon, hash browns, etc, as well as fresh fruit, cereal, tea coffee etc. The delivery of the food could have been slightly better organised as what we found was is that, even though the hotel was very quiet, with very few dinners, on most mornings, it did take a long time to be served our food, a small inconvenience though, and the quality of the overall breakfast made up for this.When we were visiting it was still the off season, so it was fairly quite, a good time to visit.We hired a car for the week, and I would highly recommend this, as firstly, its a nice method of arrival to the hotel form Faro Airport which is about 50km away, and secondly, driving around the Algarve is a great way to take in all the scenery, and visit one of the many beaches. We had young children with us and they also loved the day trips in the car.According to our research, this is one of a few hotels where the beach really is within walking distance, and I must say as far as beaches go the beach at Porto de Mos, is ideal. It has two great places to dine, and was uncrowded.This is a great location for people looking to get away from the crowded tourist locations, such as Albufera, to simply relax and unwind.The hotel staff were all very pleasant, and very helpful in pointing out local amenities, such as supermarkets, restaurants etc. Again having the car really did help.We loved our time in the Algarve and at the Belmar Spa and Beach Resort, and would definitely recommend it to others.",May,2012,May 2012,2012-05-01,2012,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,deebeemee2022,0,deebeemee2022wrote a review May 2022,"I stayed here with my friends and their kids, it's a family hotel, it's not for young people going on a holiday or for couples. Kids had a great time, they were on the go all day, either with Kids Club or in the pool or on the slide or going for slushies and snacks. Buffet was different every night, the two restaurants were lovely too, can't complain as a single person tagging along on a family holiday!!",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,5
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,ReallyBadHat,199,ReallyBadHatwrote a review Jul 2015,"A grand, old style quirky hotel that attracts a loyal clientel who return time and time again, being treated more like visiting family rather than guests.  It is understated, appealing to the well known wanting peace and quiet.This is no boxy modern chain clone, it has character. There are ups and downs, accept both or choose a modern boxy alternative.Light switches in unusual spots, as are sockets, finding your way can be confusing and there are a plethora of split levels, I find this endearing.The decor is being upgraded, in a classy traditional Portuguese style, cooling and refined.  There are a wide choice of room configurations, our double was spacious, had a huge bed, lots of storage, a separate wc and bathroom, safe, minibar, coffee making, settee, coffee table, relaxing chairs and a balcony overlooking the internal courtyard, it was due to be refurbished.  The air con is old and noisy, hopefully due for an upgrade.The bar has had a make over and is a very stylish.Breakfast is a highlight, relaxed, extensive, high quality, on a sunny morning taking it outside on the terrace by the pool is a joy.If the pool isn't your choice, there are dedicated beach loungers and towels with food and drinks delivery.Many guests take advantage of the preferential rates / access to the San Lorenzo / Pineros Altos golf courses (reviewed separately)Close to a complex of restaurants, bars and activities for children.Most staff are friendly, enthusiastic and helpful, surprisingly some of the customer service team seem a bit reserved / standoffish, it may be the appearance rather than how they really are.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,djenk_moscow,95,djenk_moscowwrote a review Jul 2017,Stayed a week along with another family - using interconnected rooms which worked very well - spacious rooms with decent balconies. All front office personnel were extremely helpful all week - from arrival to check out - very friendly and professional.Breakfast was ok / not in my view great - certainly I had expected more given the level of the hotel and prices charged.We only had one lunch (there are many places to eat close by) and it was not impressive - restaurant was pretty empty at lunch and dinner and I feel they don't try too hard.The staff in the lobby bar were always helpful - though seemed quiet there also at night. There was some particularly awful 'live Music' there one night with a bizarre Elvis type singer - just really cringe-worthy.For me overall a nice hotel - some good points but some others that need some attention,Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,4

Palacio Vila Flor,Rosemary C,1,Rosemary Cwrote a review Aug 2015,"This place is really welcoming and personable. Hotels.com had some shady note about how they would charge an extra $130 at check in on top of the advertised price. We emailed them and they were very concerned and assured us that was not the case. We arrived to an adorable side street in the Alfama district. Our hosts were so sweet and there were many maps and they had useful advice about where to go.Our room was pretty basic: 2 twin beds. It was hot but we opened up the garden doors and used the provided fan so that helped. My only complaint was the bathroom. There was no proper shower curtain so we both ended up flooding the bathroom inadvertently, for which I felt badly. Not sure if I was only supposed to bathe?  Anyway the place had bright colors and beverages and common areas available. Breakfast was rolls, cheese, jam, coffee, some sort of meat, cereal, and a lot of Nutella. And juice.The hosts were so friendly and welcoming, and the location was perfect. I would like to move to Lisbon and be their business partner.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,4

Everything is very scarce, kitchenware, little information at reception about the surroundings. We took a room for three people and the very narrow sofa turned out to be the third bed.

While there was some construction going on near the hotel, we weren't bothered by it at all. The rooms were very clean and modern. The hotel staff was extremely helpful through out our stay. We arrived early in the morning from the States and they allowed us to relax in the pool area. My husband wanted a massage and they made arrangements for him to have one soon after we arrived. We found great restaurants in the neighborhood. Our only disappointment was the limited menu choices for dinner. The breakfast spread was outstanding. We enjoyed the roof top lounge.

Independente Principe Real,georgetravelling2017,0,georgetravelling2017wrote a review Sep 2017,"There is no doubt the location is good and the breakfast and night bar are excellent. The staff are really friendly as well, particularly the marvellous breakfast lady Lourdes. The room had a beautiful faded glory familiar in Lisbon and there is a feeling of space and calm friendliness.HOWEVER, the hotel is RIPPING PEOPLE OFF in my opinion by charging too high rates when  there is a) massive ongoing building works nearby, and b) huge traffic noise on cobbles and tramlines. As we were leaving I heard a French lady making. these very complaints, and being handled very nicely by the desk staff but she was saying the hotel misrepresented itself as far as she was concerned.To be handed earplugs on arrival says it all really doesn't it ?NOT STAYING AGAIN for that noise at those prices.

Unfortunately, it still has a few teething problems, e.g. the television in the room worked intermittently and room service breakfast was delayed by over an hour as the order card wasn't picked up in the night. However, I'm confident that with some work on the part of management this will become a great hotel.",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4
PortoBay Liberdade,MikeAtsill,87,MikeAtsillwrote a review Sep 2017,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel although we only rested, slept and showered there so can't comment on any of the other amenities. The hotel is well placed on a side street off Av Liberdade and is an easy walk to most of the central attractions. We had a classic room with a balcony and it was always clean and well presented by the housekeeping staff. The street is quiet, although they are doing some renovations to the inside of a building on Av de L, and the room was sunny. The front desk staff were very good and made our arrival and departure an enjoyable experience. All in all very pleasant. The one thing we didn't understand is why a 5 star hotel would charge you per capsule to refresh the coffee in the room. Very odd when you can walk over the road to Delta's shop on Av Liberdade and buy them for much less than the hotel was charging - I mean how much coffee can you drink in one day! I think I now understand what bean counter means. Anyway, gripe over, we had a great time and enjoyed our stay.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",racecoursedonut,50,racecoursedonutwrote a review Jun 2019,"We had a wonderful time at Reid's where we stayed for 10 nights in June on a bed and breakfast basis, booked directly via Belmond's central booking team. It was our first trip to Madeira so we had no prior conceptions of what to expect.I notice that a recent reviewer has used the same word I would use about Reid's....it's a 'class' place. The hotel also has 'style'. Our room was very comfortable and had a great view. Service throughout the hotel was excellent, friendly, but unobtrusive and not at all 'stuffy'. The pools area and the Pool Terrace restaurant/pool service were excellent. ( That goes for breakfasts, the occasional lunch and the one Sunday evening buffet dinner we experienced there). We didn't try the William restaurant so can't comment on that. We used room service a few times for hot drinks and service was very quick. ( Soft drinks are complimentary from the room's mini bar but there is no hot drink-making facility in the room itself). And we did the 'signature' afternoon tea which was excellent too.We didn't use or even visit the gym or the spa.The shuttle to town worked really well on the few occasions we used it and we got the impression that if it was full then the hotel would pay for a taxi instead. But it stops early evening. We also walked down ( and up...the hotel is up a hill) and took an, inexpensive, taxi a few times. There are plenty of decent restaurants within walking distance or a short taxi drive away down in town if you are not on a half board deal. Of course Reid's is a costly option, and the food and drink in the hotel are expensive compared with outside places, but we felt the B and B terms were good value for the overall experience.Yes, to some Reid's might appear a little old fashioned in terms of rooms, common parts and decor compared with more modern offerings but we liked it a lot.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,eobet,1,eobetwrote a review Jun 2019,"This resort is perched right by one of the famous coastal cave formations, which is both amazing and slightly unfortunate. It’s amazing because of the view, but unfortunate because there’s no beach (well, there is a very small one but there’s quite a steep drop to get to it).This means the pool area gets crowded fast, and if you want to reserve a spot overlooking the ocean, you need to get out there early. The pool area also looks straight into any room with a balcony, and you can even see into neighboring balconies, so there’s very little privacy.The spa has a number of treatment rooms, but the free area is as small as you’d have in a private house. The sauna only fits three to four people, and the same with the steam room (which was broken when we visited). There’s no pool or other facilities in the spa. We did not use the gym.The food served is a bit uneven. It’s ok on a “bad” day, and amazing on the right day. Our first day had a superb selection, like good enough that was really memorable.The rooms are fine, but nothing special. The bed covers are weirdly thick, like you’re in the UK or something similar up north.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,4
Torel Palace Porto,Bill M,7,Bill Mwrote a review Jun 2024,"This is a stunning reuse of a heritage building near the main shopping street in the city. Our corner room was spacious and comfortable, and there was plenty of natural light. The king bed and linens were top quality. We had a nice balcony overlooking the pool and bar, but noise from within and outside the hotel was never a problem, partly due to the heavy wooden shutters inside the windows and French doors that blocked out light and sound. The room design includes a bathroom - essentially a mirrored box - occupying the center of the room . While this may sound strange, it worked very well. The bathroom was well-equipped and large enough for our needs. Staff were all very friendly and thoroughly professional; everyone seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had an outstanding experience. Breakfast was a real treat, with cooked-to-order food and an extensive buffet stocked with fresh and delicious things. We will certainly book the Torel Palace for our next Porto stay, and will consider staying at this company's other properties.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4

Hilton Garden Inn Évora,Beverly B,4,Beverly Bwrote a review Apr 2024,"The location is very good, we walked to everything. The setup of the room was the best in regards to the bathroom: the shower was in a little room by itself, the toilet was in a different little room, the sink was in the main room. Everything was clean and comfortable. My only complaint was that we had a shirt cleaned and it came back with the same stains and barely pressed, still damp. I told the front desk and they did remove the cleaning charge. Also, the drinks at the bar, whether alcoholic or just espresso, are expensive.",Apr,2024,Apr 2024,2024-04-01,2024,4
Predicados do Douro Palace,aggcardiff,87,aggcardiffwrote a review Apr 2018,"If you are fortunate enough to find a room in this lovely establishment, book it! This is a guest house set in a former gallery. The interior of the building is absolutely stunning having been lovingly restored in 2017. The lounge area is beautiful with free coffee, cakes, tea and port on tap. Breakfast is a lovely buffet with plenty of fresh fruit, cheese and bread etc. My beautiful room was large and overlooked the garden.  All the fittings were brand new and the room was designed with real style. Great quality bathroom products too! The bed was sumptuous with an abundance of high  quality pillows. The lovely hosts were also a delight - friendly and helpful.I would say that this is far more a boutique hotel than a simple guesthouse and it offered incredible value in beautiful Porto.Porto is a very hilly city and this is located on the higher side. Although you can walk to the main upper town square / train station (20 mins?) you are likely to be using more taxis / buses. But given the excellent value and the fact that taxis are very cheap in Porto do not let this deter you!! There is a taxi rank five mins away and a bus stop directly opposite (and I mean directly!) will take you to Aliados where you will find the main train station (San Bento).  Also directly opposite the hotel you will find the Crystal Palace park. It's beautiful and I would recommend that you walk to the far end of it (ten minute walk) where a watch tower is a popular spot for people to watch sunsets over the Douro.Within a ten minute walk of the hotel you will also find the University. There is a lovely square directly next to this with plenty of good restaurants.Book it!Muito obrigado. Foi perfeito!",Apr,2018,Apr 2018,2018-04-01,2018,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,scaroha,54,scarohawrote a review Jul 2016,Just returned after 7 nights at the CP Vilamoura. Hotel is in a great location to explore the marina and the beach. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are modern and clean. The beds and linen are of a high std. Yes a few extras would have made all the difference - such as bathrobes or a 2nd seat on the balcony but these are small items and do not effect anyones enjoyment of a good hotel. I used the hairdresser on site to get ready for a wedding and the service was really good. Breakfast each morning was fresh and nicely presented  - with plenty of staff to provide coffee. I used Yellowfish for my airport transfer.,Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,2
Pestana Viking,grannyjune,17,grannyjunewrote a review Mar 2014,"We stayed in an apartment suite, with a stunning view of the Atlantic Ocean the rooms were nice and clean, the kitchen area had a fridge and microwave and double electric cooking rings Toaster and coffee tea making facilities.  Breakfast buffet was good but we didn't have dinners there. Lovely italian restaurant up the road and a local mini market a stone throw away from the hotel , we stayed just out of season so quite a few places are closed until the end of March.Along the Seven Hanging Valleys Walk are lovely cliff top walks overlooking picturesque beaches but most are not accessible  it has medium difficulty for walkers wear good trainers. There is very little health and safety in place which means that you do have to be careful and keep back from the edges of the cliffs.Its a good example of the Algarve coastal wildlife and many species flora and fauna and a fair share of coastal birds which are easy to see along the way.",Mar,2014,Mar 2014,2014-03-01,2014,3

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Heidi W,5,Heidi Wwrote a review Oct 2017,"Perfectly located for a short walk to the marina, shops and restaurants the hotel looks great from the outside and has lovely well kept grounds. It is spacious and kept very clean. Staff in general are very pleasant and helpful ( you'll always get the odd one who isn't!). The bedroom (we had a standard double ) was generous in size with a lovely bathroom and cleverly set up with plenty of very large mirrors! Beds made everyday but the room could have been hoovered a bit better......especially under the bed which is always a sign of how thorough the cleaners have been, and some of the glass in the bathroom cleaned better ( it is a five star after all).Breakfast had a huge choice, though once you are seated it is very hit and miss with being asked if you would like tea or coffee and quite often you end up chasing staff who are more intent on clearing tables ready for the next guests as it's a slightly undersized room. That being said a special thank yew must go to Bruno, a young man who worked very hard and would always go out of his way to get my wife a jug of very hot water for her tea rather than the Luke warm that comes as standard in the tea pots.We ate once in the restaurant in the evening which was very nice indeed, no complaints at all.Unfortunately at we had an evening flight and because the hotel was full again ( which speaks volumes for it ) we had to use the pool side shower facilities to freshen up before leaving.The Spa at the hotel is very nice, a gym which had loose weights ( a couple of slightly heavier ones would be a good addition) and machines. The steam room and sauna were undergoing refurbishment and out of use (but no price reduction!) so still paying 11 euros for indoor pool and whirlpools. We both had treatments in the spa, a \"couples\" relaxing massage which includes champagne and strawberries, my wife also had Lymph drainage treatments which she was very pleased with and I halos had a sports massage ( I've had quite a few over the years) and was absolutely the best one I've ever had! Absolutely perfect.We would both definitely stay here again with no hesitation but having stayed at the Tivoli Marina before and based only on the cleanliness of the bedrooms and service at breakfast, I'd be slightly swayed to go for the Tivoli but my wife chose the Crowne Plazza!",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,4

Pestana Viking,Adam W,11,Adam Wwrote a review Jun 2012,"We booked this hotel with great anticipation. Looking at the Pestana website, the images they used really sold the hotel to us but we were concerned that we would arrive to find that the best rooms had made the brochure. We booked the hotel and made a number of requests...we had asked for a double room, on the highest floor possible due to other reviews saying that the trees blocked the views on lower floors.We arrived at the hotel in beaming sunshine on 24th May 2012. We were greeted with a smile and were immediately shown to our room. We had no reason to be concerned. Walking to our room, the hotel's decor was modern, fresh and very clean. We were taken to the 7th floor (the highest) and shown to room 708. The room was large with a double bed (two twins pushed together), a kitchenette, plenty of storage, tv, air-conditioning, table and chairs. We opened the large glass door on the balcony to breathtaking views across the cliffs, beach and open seas. We were delighted. The bathroom was huge with a wide sink, bath, shower and bidet.We were treated like royalty throughout our stay and the staff could not do enough for us. Fresh towels every day, beach towels every two days, they would arrange excursions for us when we wanted, they sorted car hire out for us and even arranged for an early breakfast when we departed on the 31st May at 6am in the morning.The hotel grounds were stunning, a little breezy by the side of the pool given that we were at the top of a cliff, but this made relaxing in the sun much more comfortable. The pools were great (indoor and out) with few people crowding them. The outdoor pool was salt water so we tended to use the indoor pool as the outdoor salt water pool was a bit cold. The gym looked great (we didn't use it...c'mon, we were on holiday). There was a massage center too. We could go to one of two beaches either side of the hotel. We tended to go for the beach to the right as there was a nice restaurant to get out of the sun and where the food was great.Speaking of food, the food at the hotel was great. We were on a  half board basis which represented only 10% of the guests. The remainder seemed to be on bed and breakfast basis only. As you can imagine, the breakfast sitting was busy, with plenty of food to choose from. We had the option of a full cooked breakfast, or continental with bread and cheeses. There were cereals and fruits, yoghurt, cake, tea and coffee.Lunch was quite pricey if purchased from the hotel, so we tended to visit the beach restaurant where food was a bit better value. Drinks were quite costly too at the hotel. I think I paid 7 Euros for two glasses of Pepsi, whereas on the beach, you could get two cans of Pepsi for 3 Euros.Due to the few guests on half board, dinner was a little more limited and the restaurant was a lot quieter. You tended to have two meat dishes (one fish), two veg dishes, a rice and a potato dish to choose from. The choice was limited but tasted great. There was also a salad bar with pasta, soup and bread, ice cream and a selection of other deserts. You would never go hungry but sometimes you would fancy  something a little different. Of the 7 nights we were there, we ate out three times just to get a little more variety.Location of the hotel is in a quiet spot, not much around the hotel but we were happy with that. We hired a car for three days and visited Albufeira and Caviaro. Albufeira was busy with plenty to look at.So, a near perfect holiday. We are 25 and seemed to be surrounded by older guests and young families, but this was not a problem for us. We were able to fully relax and loved spending our days on the beach or by the pool, we only wish we had booked two weeks rather than one.Only negatives (and they are not really negatives) was the choice of food at dinner and the salt water out door pool. Apart from that, we had a fantastic time and would go back tomorrow.Thanks to all staff at the Pestana Viking for making us so welcome, no doubt we will be seeing you again!!",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,4

Luna Hotel Da Oura,Zoe L,0,Zoe Lwrote a review Sep 2025,"We have been going to this hotel as a group of girls in their 20s for 4 years in a row and have never had an issue, HOWEVER this time the experience has been simply awful. Firstly having to pay a â‚¬300 deposit we were unaware of due to anti social behaviour going on in the hotel. Secondly the room STUNK, the cleaners only ever came around in the late afternoon when we would be getting ready to go out? you cannot check in until after 4pm whilst check out is 11am??? the noise was ridiculous between people screaming in rooms / balconies and thumping around we genuinely thought people had gotten into our room. This would go on every night up until 4/5amOn our last day whilst leaving our belongings in storage we had two left over bottles of water from our room which we carried down to the pool, for the worker manning it to shout at us saying we were not allowed our water at the pool and that we had to buy it at the bar. Which is absolutely ridiculous. This stay has been extremely disappointing and I would never return, I would advise to go elsewhere.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,1

Pestana Viking,David Q,13,David Qwrote a review Oct 2016,"Couldn't fault the hotel much. It had actually been luxurious and the whole aspect still was but the public rooms needed updating and the hotel is in fact to be renovated this winter. Very near - 10 minutes stroll - a very nice beach with rentable sunbeds/shares and a good café/restaurant at the back. There are maybe a dozen restaurants to suit all pockets with 10 minutes walk from the hotel. There is a good little place 50 yards away.  Breakfast was good in the hotel and they have a very good \"bistro\" beside the pool. Slightly disappointing that the bar didn't seem to do snack. There was live entertainment every night in the bar. Personally I don't like this though many I suppose do. I'd prefer just some background music. The staff were very accommodating and genuinely friendly. Our room was comfortable and had a kitchenette and two loos! All in al a good place to stay.",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,3

I don't know where to start because everything about my experience was great!The hostel was completely clean, from the common areas, to the bedrooms and bathrooms.The lounge is super comfortable, the perfect place to meet friends, eat, relax, and access wifi.The kitchen is huge and convenient; you can cook, store food, find leftovers..At the bar, they serve free shots each night before the pub crawl which really brings the guests together and pumped up to have a good time. It was such a fun environment.And the 4-course dinner (with 3 drinks) for only 10 euro each night just might be my favorite thing about Yes!

Pestana Bahia Praia,GCM012,14,GCM012wrote a review Jul 2015,"Bahia Palace has been my home base when I visit my native land.  It’s in a quiet area and I always get a room facing the beach and the pool.  I feel relaxed here.  I can open the balcony doors and window and enjoy the prevailing west wind coming into the room.  At night, the area is dark enough to sit out on balcony and enjoy the night sky along with the calls of the cagarras (seagull type birds).  I’ve always found them comical.   There is a walking path to the beach and there is a snack bar in the beach area which is opened until mid-night.  It’s a great place to stop in for after dinner drinks and enjoy the sound of the waves rolling onto the beach.  You can also enjoy the hotel bar for drinks and sit out on the balcony with the same view.  Although the hotel is on a bus route, I’ve always rented a car and there is ample parking at the hotel.  It’s about a 20 minute ride to downtown Ponta Delgada—I have it well timed since I had to pick up part of my party staying at Gaivota Hotel a few days.The buffet breakfast is very good.  There is a wide selection of breakfast items along with a variety of juices, and of course, fantastic coffee.  Once the breakfast staff were made aware a person in our party had a lactose allergy, they approached her every morning to ask if she was ready for her special order of scrambled eggs.  That’s service!  Which also goes out to everyone from receptionist desk to building maintenance.  Our comfort mattered to everyone at the hotel.Bahia Palace is beautiful and is very clean but is in need of some upgrades (air conditioning doesn’t work as well as it should, there are areas where carpeting needs to be replaced and décor needs freshening up).  The exciting news is that Bahia Palace will close in October and reopen in May of next year.  It will be getting an overhaul and I look forward to seeing the changes.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,5
