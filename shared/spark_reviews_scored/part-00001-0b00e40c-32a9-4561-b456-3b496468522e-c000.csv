Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Claire,4,Clairewrote a review Aug 2022,"This was our second trip to this hotel, the 1st being in 2019. The hotel is constantly listening to reviews and comments and we could see great improvements have been made all over. Excellent food, room quality, entertainment team, staff and drinks.

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,wavechick,2,wavechickwrote a review Jul 2023,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom townhouse, the floor space was enormous and facilities excellent. Although there were renovations at the time, it didn't spoil our stay. Location, location, location! We were moments away from the best beach and amazing rock scenery, and we had a sea view which was beautiful in the evenings as the sun set. We were pleasantly surprised to find that our townhouse had a roof terrace and access to a private garden. These were sheltered and warm, making an excellent sunbathing area, private, wind free and quiet.Staff made us feel welcome and were helpful. A resort map or app to find the bars, pools, beaches and local restaurants would be useful.",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,5

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Jane Doe,1,Jane Doewrote a review Jun 2019,"I stayed in belmar with husband and my four children, we had a lovely stay but some vital facilities were missing. For example the tennis courts they advertise A) are not owned by Belmar but my the city council meaning that everyone coming off the beach could use them and B) are not set up as tennis courts, if you want to play tennis you have to go and ask one of the receptions to put up the nets.The gym is for over 18's which was very unfair for my 16 year old daughter who is very into her fitness and was not able to work out because of this age barrier. The pools are very cold but spacious and two of the five pools have beautiful sea views. The indoor pool is very clean and all pools are well maintained except for the wooden planks running along side. My son got a huge splinter in his foot from one of the wooden planks during our holiday. We alerted the staff and they fixed that exact area but I noticed other potential splinter areas which were never fixed.I think adding pool tables, football tables or air hockey tables would make a huge difference to the atmosphere. When we were there is was very dead, it felt like we were the only ones staying in the the resort even though they told us it was fully booked out. Everything is quite bland and doesn't fell homely but we definitely enjoyed our stay in belmar. If they take on some of my advice this will make the resort even better than it already is.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,459diane,20,459dianewrote a review May 2017,We had a one bedroom apartment with a large balcony and sea view.  The apartment was very well furnished with a beautiful kitchen.  The kitchen was well stocked.  The resort supplied beach towels.  There was a heated indoor pool but the 2 outdoor pools were not heated.  Heated outdoor pools would be my only suggestion.  The sea view from the pools was beautiful. This resort was only 1 mile from Lagos but we ended up driving because it was uphill.  The breakfast at the resort was very good.  We would definitely stay here again.,May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4
Villas Barrocal,ManningNL,11,ManningNLwrote a review Aug 2013,"Our family of 6 (4 boys - 7,7,10,16 years) stayed in a 3 bedroom villa for 2 weeks. It is a quiet complex and its location is some distance from the main resort of Albuferia but this is what makes the complex so enjoyable, as you don't have loud youngsters. It is very much a family complex. You need to hire a car to get around, Albuferia is about 15-20km away. However on the complex there is a pool bar (lady who serves is very friendly) with WIFI and event afternoons which includes a reptile show, a bar/cafe outside the complex, as well as a shop (which sells fresh bread daily), a pharmacy not far away and near the pharmacy is a very authentic Portuguese restaurant (selling the most amazing fish, meats etc) which is reasonably priced and very friendly!! The Villas are very quiet, spacious and very clean. The maid service is impeccable.All in all the complex is brilliant and we had a wonderful holiday!!",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,5
Monte Joao Roupeiro,LLA-777,4,LLA-777wrote a review Sep 2014,"We stayed at Monte Joao Roupeiro in September and it completely exceeded our expectations.  The whole place appears to be fairly new or newly renovated.  The grounds, lawn, and gardens were beautiful.  The room was large and comfortable with a really nice bathroom.  There was a comfortable den and an absolutely stunning pool which we enjoyed in the late afternoon after getting back from hiking along the cliffs to Odeceixe.  Breakfast was excellent.  Free wifi.  The town of Odeceixe is a 5 minute drive away with charming restaurants and the beach.  This was an excellent value for the money and a very relaxing and beautiful place to stay.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Anthony F,21,Anthony Fwrote a review Apr 2016,"This review is coming really really late, but my girlfriend and I were going over some of our favorite places we've stayed over the years and this one came up in conversation, so I felt like I had to give a review. We stayed last August here for a little more than a week, and it was one of the nicest, well run hostels we've ever been in. There are so many little spots to relax and hang out, whether it be a hammock or a bean bag chair. They have a movie room, which we didn't use, but had we stayed more long-term it would have come in handy. The staff was super friendly and were always willing to help out with any questions we had, or even just to hang out and play a game of cards or pool together.The room was very spacious for a 4 bedroom dorm and very very clean. Sometimes you get what you pay for staying in hostels but this place had more of a hotel feel with hostel prices. The bathrooms were also very clean and I would see cleaning ladies cleaning multiple times a day.Overall I would say this is the nicest hostel I have ever stayed in ( stayed in about 40 total ). Everything from the staff to the location ( Rossio Station ) is perfect and helped make my trip to Lisbon one of the best i've ever had. The next time I go to Lisbon I will definitely be staying here again.Ah! I also forgot to mention they have a chef that comes in and prepares a dinner at night for a modest fee! I'm not sure if it's the same chef, but he was amazing. The food was always so so good and for the amount of courses (4?) the price was well worth it. It's these little things that make the hostel stand out against the rest.",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,4

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,823AndreaLA823,29,823AndreaLA823wrote a review Mar 2022,"We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay. While the hotel is beautifully appointed and the room was beyond comfortable, it is the warmth and kindness of the staff that is especially memorable. Before our arrival, one of the team members, Ruben, was responsive to my questions regarding Covid requirements, car rentals and restaurant recommendations. During our visit, Cristalle was the most helpful and accommodating concierge. The woman who cleaned our room noticed that we enjoyed the little butterfly cookies left at night - so she left extras.All the staff made us feel welcome and cared for in this elegant yet unpretentious hotel.",Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,4

Washing machine dish washer ,2 tv's tooth brush etc in room.Not so good,Tiny balcony with only 2 chairs when reservation is for 4 people.Sofa is very uncomfortable to sit on and totally awful to sleep on.Pool is 1.45m no shallow part ( apart from the baby pool)No atmosphere at the pool , some days we were the only people in it,tried water polo but nobody else wanted to play,tried football but also no one else there,  in fairness one staff member did tell my son to look for him and he would play with him.beds at pool reserved at the crack of dawn. Evening entertainment wasn't great either, mostly older French holiday makers who seemed to enjoy it.Was a kids club room but didn't see anyone in there. Kids arcade room and pool table 1euro a go. We didn't eat in the restaurant but had sandwiches from the bar menu which were lovely.  We tried to order pizza but both days it was not available.Big group of 10-15 loud men arrived for last few days and took over the pool which didn't help either.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,3
Vila Galé Albacora,Needhamy,13,Needhamywrote a review Sep 2015,"My wife and myself spent a week on an all inclusive basis at this hotel from 12th to 19th September. It is located on an isolated headland and is a pleasant 45 minute walk to the nearest town of Tavira which we did on three occasions during our stay.The food was adequate and well presented with the outside snack bar being my favourite as with the all inclusive option you can have any snack as well as drinks which in my case was the local beer, Super Bock.The pool area was well kept and there was no need to reserve sun beds as there was more than enough (a first for me!)There is a free shuttle bus into Tavira five days a week and for 3 euro return you can get a ferry to the nearby beach island which has a long beach and quite a few bars/restaurants.From previous reviews we went prepared with ant repellent but found none. Instead we were bitten extensively by mosquitos- apparently it was a combination of the time of the year together with the location of water ponds in the vicinity. This was only a minor inconvenience and did not spoil our holiday.The evening entertainment was not the best I have encountered but was adequate with the bar area being of an high standard with good service.We found all the staff friendly and helpful and would recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for an holiday away from the mainstream locations on the Algarve.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,dondifay,2,dondifaywrote a review May 2016,"Was here for a conference and the hotel had good conference facilities.  The hotel itself is about 5 euros by taxi on the average from the main part of the city with all the restaurants and shop.  There is a bus stop nearby but a bit of a walk from the nearest subway stop.   Taxis were readily available. The room is good sized with a good number of english channels with their TV cable, which is a welcome treat compared to many european hotels.  The bathroom needs a bit of repair with some wooden areas showing signs of rotting.   The beds and pillows were very good and up to the standards of a Marriott hotel.  Service by the front line staff, concierge, restaurant and front door was excellent.  The buffet breakfast was likewise excellent.    WiFi was offered free as part of the conference hotel package.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4

Hotel Casa do Tua,Roy B,9,Roy Bwrote a review Sep 2018,"We travelled from Porto on the Douro Line train from Campanho as this left about 13.00 The only other train which went the whole journey leaves at 09.13 or there about from Sao Bento As seniors we travelled half fare which was about 13 euros The first hour ambled through the outer city and then we started to travel along the Douro river. What a great journey and great view. This is the only way to see the Douro Valley as the cruises sit so much lower down.Great attention from the train manager as we spoke only English which to be honest is no problem in Portugal. Tua station arrives and we leave the train just 20 yards from the hotel.Good reception and great access to all rooms with a lift available.Do book a river view as this view is the essence of the Douro valley.Bedrooms have comfortable beds and wi-fi Swimming pool was a good size with large patio south facing, with relaxers,chairs and umbrellas which are regularily needed in this super environment. Breakfast is continental with a wide choice of meats and cheeses, hot and cold drinks,cornflakes etc. jam and cakes. Coffee Tea and various others. Jug of Orange on your table with a basket of warm bread.Choice of scrambled, boiled or fried eggs. This is all just 20 yards from the station, the culture centre and the restaurant. If you eat in the restaurant,which I recommend be warned. Many of the meals come in a choice of small or large. Small means large, large means share with at least one partner. Do visit the culture centre next to the station which gives a presentation of the dam and how it has affected the local environment.This must be enough. Please visit and enjoy and find yourself.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,5

Saccharum,Julie R,22,Julie Rwrote a review Aug 2017,"This hotel is without doubt lovely, however is is ultra modern, has an industrial feel and is very dark inside.We booked what we thought was a mountain view suite but it was in an enclosed courtyard and was so dark and quite depressing.We were moved to a suite which was such smaller with a sea view without charge which was much better.The staff and facilities are fantastic. Being built into the hill the hotel has been very cleverly designed but lacks any grounds, everything is built on levels including the pools.Calheta is very small and there are only a handful of restaurants and a supermarket. Was lovely for a week but trips out are a must really if you want to see the island.The plane was diverted overnight to Gran Canaria as the winds over Madeira prevented landing.Jet 2 were absolutely fantastic. Lovely hotel in GC all expenses covered for food and accommodation and 60 euros to spend in the airportTransfers to hotel fantastic once we arrived with a guided tour provided by the driver of Windsor travel.Overall lovely for a week, definitely book a side or full sea view, ideal for a chill out week, weather was fantastic as was the service but the hotel is dark in its style and decoration albeit beautifully appointed.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Saccharum,heather m,0,heather mwrote a review Aug 2025,This hotel has stunning views but that’s where it ends. The wait staff at the bar are incredibly rude. Eye rolling. Blank stares. Horrible lunch. Breakfast buffet was good but two of the waitresses were so rude that we almost left. Lunch was awful. Drinks are watered down. No pool service two days in a row. The hotel is not clean on a 5 star level. It’s dark and you have to ask for clean sheets and towels. The mini bar is not a real mini bar and we were in an ocean view suite. The topper is that we were charged 175.00 for items that we did not purchase. As I stated earlier the views are stunning but this is a 2 star hotel at best.,Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,2

Saccharum,Michael A,25,Michael Awrote a review May 2018,"I would have gone for a higher star rating if it hadn’t been for the lack of openness about the risk of parking fines.My partner and I had 8 days holiday here in mid May. The hotel is good but more 4 than 5 stars in my view.The sea view room was well worth it and the room was very comfortable and well equipped. Housekeeping service was fantastic with sheets changed every couple of days.Bear in mind that the shower is in an open glass booth with no door. We didn’t mind at all but some people might.The hotel faces a road with some traffic - not a major issue except at weekends when there was a noisy car rally with zooped up car engines going for several hours each evening between 5-8 pm such that we couldn’t sit on the balcony because of noise and air pollution.The main concern is that the parking at the hotel is insufficient and the charge is 7 Euro per day. Not right for a 5 star hotel to charge for parking, especially as it’s not a city or town centre hotel.Many hire cars park on the road facing up the hill from the hotel and many each day get a 30 E fine/ticket from the local police as we did. There is no “no parking” sign.We got caught once and so parked elsewhere. The hotel must know that this is a regular happening and should be making it absolutely clear that you can’t park on the road on check-in and in the hotel information.The police are making a lot of money here and it’s not right that the hotel don’t alert guests. Reception took a “shrug shoulder” approach here.The buffet restaurant food was pretty good for both breakfast and dinner with a good range of choices and some short order chef options. Sometimes we had to chase up to order coffee, tea and wine, but the restaurant staff were charming in the main.If you want to eat in the à la carte restaurant they only offer a very small 13E allowance, which is pretty ungenerous if you have paid for half-board as we had.The pools are good, especially the infinity pool.I liked the hotel brutalist decor but bear in mind that it is quite dark in the lobby especially if you are partially sighted.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,4

Right in the middle of one of the nicest areas in Lisbon with plenty of lovely restaurants and bars within close proximity and all of the main sights within easy reach.The apartment itself is beautifully clean and the penthouse apartment that we stayed in had amazing views over the city.

The kids outdoor play area is ok to kill some time with the kids too.However its website states it's been refurbished to a high standard, although it doesn't say when, there is a fair few things that fail this hotel to be a 5* from the dirty overflow grate in the pool, to the limited cleaning of the actual pool, the toilet facilities adjoining to the pool, which appear to be clean in the morning then from around 10am you have to walk through the piss for the rest of the day in the men's toilet, would add that most guests would do this then jump into the pool with a pissy foot, a sign would be handy to wash their feet on the way out, 1 pissoir broken out of 2 during our stay, footpath lightings knocked over no employee had the decency to reinstate them till our last day.Poolbar could do with a bin outside, litter picking could be better throughout the day. Most of the staff at the pool bar are nice, but the older lady could smile every now and then as she looks miserable at times, like if she would be doing a favour serving you.Fair few sunloungers are knackered, people put towels on them at early hours then show up midday even though it's against hotel policy not once I saw any towels removed.Decking around the pool is mostly split, falling apart.Rooms are generally ok, however they only seem to clean eye level, anything beyond is dusty. Complimentary fruit left rotten in room by housekeeping for days, were placing bets on it if they pick up on it🤣In the room we stayed floor was full of scratches, so as some of the walls, during our stay I doubt the balcony ever had a clean as there was crumbs under the balcony chair from the guests before. WC seat chipped, bathroom bin looks like it's been used as a drum at a death metal concert, mirror on the sliding door haven't been cleaned whilst we were there. Dried paint on tiles, sliding door etc which remains of the refurbishment obviously.Some of the furniture throughout is absolutely knackered in the restaurants, from wobbly tables to stained chairs, cushions knackered etc.This hotel is very busy over the weekends, bit quieter during the week.All in all, it might have 5 stars on the walls but whoever awarded it I'd say was clearly blind.Apart from this we had a great time here but wouldn't go back there, looks good on the pictures but it's far from it in real life.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,4

Overall this place was great and met a lot of great people! However, our room had no air conditioning and the heat was unbearable. Had no fans or anything in the room. The lounge had 2 air conditioning units which is odd when it really only needed one I'd say. They need to install an air conditioning unit into the private rooms. That would be my only criticism.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4

Ocean Gardens,DebbieAtkinson,7,DebbieAtkinsonwrote a review Aug 2019,Myself and my daughter have just returned from our stay at Ocean Garden in Madeira.Had to review as we were so happy with our stay there.We had a panoramic sea view room with balcony and were on bed and breakfast basis .We were very happy on first arriving and were greeted with a complimentary glass of Madeira wine.Our room was stunning. I think our block may be an extension to the hotel but all in a similar decorative way.The room was airy with really good air conditioning. The view towards Funchal was breathtaking.The bathroom was marble from floor to ceiling and had frosted glass door and a wonderful large shower area.Towels were changed whenever you wished and separate towels for the pool area were provided also.Breakfast was usual continental style and very adequate.Our evening meals when we are there were quite good and the waiters very helpful.My daughter is vegan so she struggled for choice sometimes but they did try to accommodate her wishes.The pool area is fabulous. Once again the panoramic view as this is situated on a roof top terrace. Everything you needed was there along with a snack and drinks bar. Perfectly adequate for lunches and lovely cocktails !The staff were all friendly and helpful and majority spoke English.There is a courtesy bus at certain times of the day which is very handy if you want to visit Funchal and it takes about 10 to 15 mins into Funchal which is a lovely city with a marina .The hotel was spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable and  I would not hesitate to stay there again - in fact I look forward to it!,Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,5

Quinta das Achadas,JBJZ,12,JBJZwrote a review Mar 2013,"We stayed at Quinta das Achadas for a week towards end of February. The setting and the quinta are beautiful - a real sense of peace about the surroundings - and Jill and Julio are friendly, amiable hosts. It was a real plus to be able to have a lie-in until 10 and still be in time for breakfast and an even bigger plus to eat it outside in the sunshine. And fresh orange juice straight from the quinta's orange trees - Tropicana will never taste the same again!!Lots of great walks in the area, beautiful beaches and there are lots of walking notes at the quinta itself that you are able to borrow. Jill gave us some great recommendations for walks and beaches too.We ate well most nights too - great area for seafood as you'd expect.I'm sure Quinta das Achadas would be a wonderful place to relax when it's warmer too - a great, hassle-free retreat.

Canto de Luz,Deepti,58,Deeptiwrote a review Jun 2024,"We stayed here for 2 nights in May. We took a train from Lisbon to Porto station in the afternoon and then took a taxi from the station to the apartment. The sign for the apartment is not very clear, and itâ€™s a bit tough to identify it on Google maps. We booked a few taxis and somehow the drivers always dropped us a little behind or a little forward each time.BF: The bf was really really good, 5 stars for sure. Loved the bf service and the fresh fruits and a different sweet they served, freshly baked. There are various choices of eggs and granola as well that you can order. My favourite was the freshly squeezed orange juice and Latte.Location: I would give the location about 2/3 stars. Next time I would probably stay close to the Duoro river and the Luis bridge. This was about 15 min walk from there, not so far. Porto is a beautiful and small city that you can easily explore on foot.Room: Great size, good toiletries. No view as far as I know (atleast ours was downstairs so there was no view)Customer service: Excellent.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4

I felt that I just had to write this review as it must have rated as one of the best hotels that we have stayed in. It is right in the heart of the old town of Funchal, literally 3 minutes walk from some really nice restaurants. The hotel itself is wonderful with all the amenities you would expect from a much larger establishment. It is the owner and his staff that  make this hotel special however. Every one of them from the chamber maids to the owner himself put themselves out to make sure that we enjoyed our stay. I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, first class holiday.",Aug,2004,Aug 2004,2004-08-01,2004,5

Room was awesome, location is perfect, and the place is just high quality.However, we decided on the dinner one night (30EUR) and it was awful. Service was absolutely terrible - one of the waiters was actually on his CELLPHONE - ignoring customers. They lost 10-12 customers through lack of care. People were walking in, being ignored - then walking out.I could go on. It was was far my worst experience of service in Portugal.The worst thing is - I have complained twice, but no-one seems to check the mails. (1 x email, 1 x support ticket). So no response!!That part of it was unacceptable. But overall I still would stay an recommend this hotel - just not the evening food/service and complaints procedure (non existant).",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,2
Casa Vela Boutique House,Tutdelafrut,48,Tutdelafrutwrote a review Jun 2013,"Stayed at the Casa Vela for 6 nights in June. The Guesthouse is situated in a very quiet part of Cascais but It's only 5-10 minutes walk from Cascais bay and town centre, with all the pubs and restaurants. (some of the best restaurants in Cascais are even closer) the rooms are modern and spacious. (I've read other reviews complaining about lack of privacy in the toilet area of the room, and must agree to some degree). The pool area however is perfect, for most of the time we enjoyed it on our own. Almost every room has direct access to the garden or a balcony with furniture, so there's always a place to enjoy the sun. Breakfast is simple but good. (and served until 11:30). Everyone working at the Casa are helpful and do their best to make your stay perfect.",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,4
Hotel dos Templarios,Susan W,31,Susan Wwrote a review May 2016,"From the moment we drove up to the hotel, we were impressed. Not once were we disappointed with the room, service or buffet breakfast. Our room was suite-like and had a balcony overlooking the river. Several times we were able to watch kids trying to go upriver in kayaks. Soccer games were taking place continuously in the distance.The hotel was within a few minutes of walking to the old town. It was very quiet and easy to get around, with very little competition from other tourists. Seems like a well-kept secret!The Convento do Cristo and castle at the top of the hill is well worth visiting and you should allocate 2-3 hours for it. It is a huge complex to tour and very interesting.Finally, we spent two nights here and we're very pleased with the value for money. The complimentary buffet breakfast was terrific with a large variety of items to try.Would very highly recommend this hotel and the town of Tomar!",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,5
Yes! Lisbon Hostel,Chris K,2,Chris Kwrote a review May 2016,"All I can say is wow, what an incredible hostel!  Everything about this place is great.  The location is very close to the waterfront and the beach.  The staff are incredibly helpful and very welcoming.  They go out of their way to make sure you are having a great time.  Especially Bruno, who took us out on the pub crawls.  My friend wore sandals on the pub crawl, and Bruno noticed this at the first pub and knew he wouldn't get in to the last bar with sandals.  So he called one of the hostel employees to bring my friend a pair of shoes so that he would get in.  Within 30 seconds of meeting Bruno you will know that he will go out of his way to make sure you have a great time.  I have never experienced such amazing customer service like that before.Also, the food is cooked by a short lady who you can tell absolutely loves cooking for people.  She made 2 amazing meals for us and I would definitely recommend eating dinner there.  Having dinner and then going out for the pub crawl is a perfect combination.The rooms are very clean, bed was comfortable, and bathrooms were very clean.  I have no complaints at all.  Best hostel that I have ever stayed at, and I will definitely be back again!",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,5
