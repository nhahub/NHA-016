Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Jennifer G,2,Jennifer Gwrote a review Apr 2023,"Stayed here from 29th march till April 7th.Like others have said the Pool is very cold literally freezing. As the days got warmer though it was easier to get in so I'd say in summer months it's perfect.There is lots of loungers and never struggled to get a space at the pool.Hotel gives pool towels which is so handy you can change these daily.Rooms are spotless and big. Beds and really comfy room cleaned daily and fresh towels provided.The food wasn't great. very little variety compared to a 3 star all inclusive we visited last year. I found the food in the 3 star hotel (club mac alcudia) much nicer than jupiter hotel. Food was often cold. We were even served cold chips in the Portuguese restaurant but they were changed for hot ones once I mentioned it to staff.I'm the buffet restaurant Plates were too hot. they are kept under the hot food counter with heat turned up.my son burned his hand on them which he received 1st aid for in the hotel. even for me they were too hot to hold the restaurant manager came to speak to me about what happened to my son I explained plates were too hot 2 other restaurant workers did agree with me they were too hot you literally couldn't hold as they were really hot. The managers reply was English people like hot plates which I thought was extremely rude!the ques for food were also long so you couldn't leave in search of a cold plate as you would loose your place. I made sure to take plates from cold buffet section to avoid using the hot plates.I feel there should be a wider variety of food especially for kids. Also more variety of hot food.Also staff take away food while you are still eating this is very annoying it happened to us alot. fizzy drinks machines often turned off in the outside part of restaurant. For guests sitting outside with young kids it's quite frustrating as you need to go inside to get drinks you come back and your food has been taken away by staff so you need to go back in and que again for food. As a single parent this was very frustrating for me. We were often sat outside as the restaurant was full and I had to make multiple journeys in and out to get food and drinks.The pizza at the snack bar was really nice kids really enjoyed that and mostly ate that for dinner and lunch.The entertainment at night is in the tent outside mini disco followed by a show. they need to put more seating in as not enough tables and chairs for the amout of guests.One of the shows the movie dance one was amazing the rest were OK. Kids loved the bouncy castle which is 6 euro per child.My kids only used kids club once for an hour so no real feed back on that, but the animation team were really good with kids at mini disco and around the pool during the day playing games.The lifts were really busy always full we were on the 4th floor so mostly walked the stairs.I loved albuferia. Zoomarine is a great day out we did 2 days there also spent a day at the old town another day at the beach and another at krazy world.A tip is to download uber for taxis  it's much cheaper. The hotel wanted to charge me 36 euro for a taxi which was 11 euro on uber!the hotel is really good just the food is a bit of a let down if I returned to albuferia I'm not sure I'd stay here again as we always do all inclusive and the hotel is amazing in every other way apart from the food. If the food was to improve I'd definitely return.",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,3
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Peter A,2,Peter Awrote a review Oct 2019,"lovely hotel in a quiet location. it has really good staff, friendly and good at their jobs, helpful. the rooms are spacious and well kept, perhaps a stocked mini bar would be nice? food is plentiful and breakfast is excellent although queues for dinner can be long, perhaps there should be a timed entry? rooftop bar is nice so try it, have a cocktail. lots of children but not a problem to us 2. the area towards the beach is a bit run down but you can always take a taxi to it , 6 euros, if you dont want to try to get on the hotels free bus which can be a nightmare.. the manager in the a la carte needs to get some manners and allow guests to sit where they like !!!a fab hotel overall and lovely staff xxx",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,PamelaTR,138,PamelaTRwrote a review Sep 2021,"When we first walked in, the hotel felt light and bright. Reception moved quickly and we were assigned a room on level 4, one level down from the front desk. At first, we were disappointed that we were given two double beds traveling as a couple but the bellman was quick to guarantee that it would be fixed and he was right it was. The views from the rooms are stunning. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and has something for everyone. The hotel is just a few minute walk from the town center. All in all, we loved our stay.",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,5

Villas Barrocal,Manuel L,0,Manuel Lwrote a review Aug 2024,Everything went well!

Villas Barrocal,Abe A,0,Abe Awrote a review Aug 2023,"Pera is a fantastic little village in the heart of the Central Algarve. During our stay we were able to travel to the beaches, mountains, Vilamoura and Portimao all within 30 minutes or so by car. There are numerous fantastic beaches just a short drive away.The villa was great too, very well equipped and had almost everything we needed for a fantastic stay. The reception staff were always helpful and friendly.The pool and poolside cafe were both excellent too. The pool is very clean and the cafe welcoming.The cleaners came every few days and cleaned our villa for us. A really nice and unexpected treat.Being really picky, the only things we would like to have seen done differently are:WiFi was very slow and sometimes totally unusable. Not a major problem as the 4G was manageable but if you're planning to watch Netflix or do a spot of work then this might be an issue.Maps, it would have been nice to have a map of the site in our guest book so we knew where the amenities were. We were briefly shown a map during check-in but it would have been nice to have one on hand. Also a map of the local village showing the eateries and shops would have been great too. We didn't discover the Pera village market and other little shops until the day we left which is a shame for the local businesses that might have benefitted.Beds - in our villa the beds were VERY firm, the bedsheets too small and the headboards were loose on the wall so they rattled at the slightest movement. It took us 3 or 4 nights to adjust to the firmness. The headboards were fixed by wedging a t-shirt behind the headboard and moving the bed away from the wall slightly. The bedsheets on the double bed kept coming loose and we got tangled in the sheets during the night. Fitted sheets would have been nicer.With all that said, would we stay again? Absolutely - YES! It was a fantastic location, great atmosphere, clean and well run. Thank you to the whole team at Villas Barrocal!",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4
1908 Lisboa Hotel,Sniff1988,13,Sniff1988wrote a review Apr 2019,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and were amazed at how good it was. Although a review we had read previously had commented on the area, we felt safe walking around it in the day and at night. The hotel couldn’t have been more convenient for the underground - which is cheap and easy to use- so we could get around, plus Tram 28 goes right outside the hotel! The reception staff were so helpful, taking the time to go through the map and pointing out things to see (they also gave us some helpful tips!) The welcome drink and pastries and port to our room were an added bonus and the breakfast was delicious! We don’t tend to go back to the same places but I think if we went back to Lisbon we would stay here again (there was some building work going on in the square, whilst we were staying so we think this area is up and coming!) Although next to a main road, we had no problems with noise.The actual room itself was perfect for what we needed with a balcony from the bedroom and bathroom. It has been decorated to a high standard. An ideal room to relax in after a day sight seeing and walking up some steep hills!",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4
The Boliqueime Inn Hotel,maureen s,12,maureen swrote a review Jul 2014,"5 days  in a chilled  atmosphere were enjoyed here, excellent value, helpful  people, would stay again. this INN ticks the right boxes , the car park is a little narrow in places, and  noise from front of building may possible disrupt your sleep.",Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,5
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,milesmad,11,milesmadwrote a review Feb 2015,"We stayed for two nights here in the smaller sister hotel of the Estalagem right on the seafront.  It was perfect!The Hotel da Vila is intimate and lovely with beautiful finishing and rooms that are sparkling white opening directly onto the sea.  We fell asleep each night listening to the ocean waves.You have access to all of the services of the hotel above, including the wonderful gardens, amazing views, incredibly beautiful pool and relaxing area.We watched the sunset directly over the sea from the cliff-side jacuzzi and the heated indoor pool.The service was perfect, friendly without being too obnoxious and overdone.The food at the Hotel da Vila was delicious - simple and tasty with a great wine list.I had a massage in the spa which was wonderful.Without a doubt, a truly wonderful place.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,CH,52,CHwrote a review Jul 2016,"Me and my boyfriend and another couple stayed at this hotel for 10 nights. Overall the rooms (we had studios) were really nice! We were in room 409 and our friends in 109- overlooking a roundabout and on ground level asked to be moved as you couldn't have your curtains open as everyone can see in! Luckily there was a room they could move to the next day. The rooms were big and on the higher floors had nice views of the sea and pool. The pool area is nice when cleaned which isn't that often and when it is cleaned it's about 10/11am. Glasses, fags and even sick one day around the pool. Sunbeds ok, however, not sure how you'd manage getting one in July/August as they were all took towards the end of the hol. Not enough umbrellas- we had to reserve one at 8am to get one. FOOD!!! Awful. Worst all inclusive I've ever been to, usually there's a few rows of food to choose from this restaurant has one row with around 7 things to choose from, even if your not a fussy eater you would struggle. The food that is on offer is grim- the chicken one day appeared grey! Puddings are the same EVERYDAY jelly in glasses, mouses in glasses and very watery cakes. The best meal is breakfast and even that isn't amazing. The scrambled eggs were swimming in milk. No food is available at the pool bar so every time you have to go into the restaurant. Pool bar opens at 12-4! Snacks in the bar are at 4 which consists of muffins (that were served at breakfast) nachos and dry cheese sandwiches. The bar shuts at 11 for all inclusive guests but 12 for paying guests. We complained the first day and spoke to the manager and food manager who advised if there was nothing we could eat just to mention it to the waiters and they would get the chef to cook us something. We did this twice and had cheeseburgers (better but still standard). One thing all the tour operators fail to advertise is the stag and hen dos that descent on the hotel at weekends. There were 4 lots on the first weekend there. Luckily not overly rowdy, however, playing with dildos around the pool to which a 5/6 yr old boy picked up, not the best 'family hotel'If your looking for self catering that's close enough to old town, new town and beach and don't mind noisy guests this hotel would be fine. It's a 2* at best though. No idea why it's ever been given 5*. Won't be returning.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,2
Lisbon Destination Hostel,nicole b,2,nicole bwrote a review Aug 2015,"Staying at the Destination Lisbon Hostel has overcome my expectations. Picture a typical youth hostel. Done? Ok, now delete whatever you have thought of. This is one of the coolest places I have ever stayed in. It's in a train station which is an historical building itself. It's young and cool, with a funky design and lots of easygoing people running it. Lisbon Destination Hostel feels like home.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,5

Lisbon Happy Hostel,Wander216105,0,Wander216105wrote a review Jul 2016,"My friend and I stayed at the Happy Hostel in a private room with bathroom. Both were very spacious and clean. The hostel is in a great location in the center. You're able to easily walk around to sightsee. There was a lot of construction going on across the street, but we didn't hear any of it. Overall the hostel was very quiet. They offer some breakfast, but we ate out everyday. The kitchen is nice though and you can buy food to cook. The hostel is on a 3rd or 4th floor walk up, but wasn't an issue with back packs. The staff was really friendly and helpful. We were very happy staying here our first time in Lisbon.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4

Large king size bed with pure cotton sheets  (very important)Perfectly fine for a short stay.We didn’t try the restaurant as we had booked one of Lisbons Michelin restaurants for our trip.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Kenny M,120,Kenny Mwrote a review Aug 2019,"We stayed at Lisbon Marriott hotel in August 2019.  The check was long due to the large number of people waiting.  One staff member completing check in who was excellent.  The poor chap was over worked with a number of other staff including the supervisor doing nothing but talk to each other.  Rooms not ready on time and no apologies given, just we are busy!!!!The rooms are decent but not usual standard experience associated with Marriott.  A bit tired all round.  This is a box standard airport hotel which offers short term rooms with no expected return other than airlines.There are many other hotels better suited to a four/ five star category, this one is not close.We witnessed a family complain to a manager about lack of communication and service regarding a room they still hadn’t received at 16-30 pm, they were told the hotel is busy and staff cannot be expected to be perfect so the guest should be happy and wait for them.  Totally disgusting service.Very poor indeed",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,2

The staff are amazing and have mostly been there for years, the villas and apartments are beautifully kept and regularly updated so they are always to a beautiful standard, every appliance is Miele and works beautifully, the pools are tended to many times a day(!) they virtually take nail scissors to tend to the gardens they're so pristine- I literally can't praise it enough. Locally you have a fabulous and incredibly spacious beach where you can gain rare beach privacy if you just walk a minute either way.  The restaurants and bars at Quinta and vale de lobo are great and have everything you might want and if you want to relax at home then the barbecues in the gardens work brilliantly and reception will even send you down a barbeque meat pack to make life easy. I could go on for hours but seriously have no concerns about booking here/ buying a share in a villa, it's totally wonderful.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5

Saccharum,mwD3475UC,130,mwD3475UCwrote a review Jul 2023,The Saccharum was much better than anticipated at time of booking - our previous 2 weeks in Madeira was at Reids Palace - so we wanted a good hotel outside Funchal this time.  Calhata is very quiet but the overall ambience of Saccharum made it a relaxing and enjoyable stay.  We paid the addition to be a Premium Guest  and we think this really enhanced our stay - particularly the included Bali beds on the premium deck were always available - so no need for “lounger scrum”.  The breakfasts on the 8th floor were prepared and served by staff - so avoiding any buffet issues.  The room was kept spotless and always cleaned by mid-day.  We dined out most nights in the local restaurants but used the Alambique on 3 nights - a really good experience and well recommended.  All the staff were very polite and competent - they were good communicators.  Easy to return and recommend.,Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,4

Torel Palace Porto,MARC KAISER,45,MARC KAISERwrote a review Oct 2022,"We stayed two nights in this luxury placefrom 9 to 11 October. We arrived by bus with a small group of travelers who had enjoyed the Transcantabrico luxury train from Bilbao to Santiago de Campostella.Upon arrival we were received in an unusually friendly way, were served a nice glass of white wine as a welcome drink while we were sitting in the library filled with books, wine shelves and parts of books fixed on the ceiling !! Registration fast and not complicated as the Hotel has a rather small number of rooms (+/- 24 rooms). We  were amazed by the interior design and ceiling frescos.My wIfe was utterly pleased by the cleanliness of our room and the Hotel in general. We stayed in room 20  on 3rd floor and were surprised to have an ultramodern TV set that was actually a mirror. We had never seen such a TV before.The bathroom had a glass roof with a sky view. Our bed was comfortable. Breakfast is served in the basement with direct access to the garden.A large buffet with many beverages provides satisfaction for everyone until 11hrs15!! At lunch time small snacks can be ordered until 15 o'clock. The Hotel is located in a rather quiet secondary street ina most centrally location. Access to it is very easy. Definitely Top Hotel in town!!",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,5
Pestana Viking,jesskm24,107,jesskm24wrote a review Jul 2019,"Long review warning!!DEFINITELY NOT 4 star quality, service or experience!!We booked the Pestana after reading the hotel reviews and picking it based on the location as we had a wedding in the local area.The hotel was easy to find and upon arrival seemed like a good match for what we had booked and expected.We unloaded the car and went to reception, the lady at reception was nice and friendly, we were told that our room wasn't quite read yet and they would phone us when it was.There is no safe area for you to leave your luggage whilst the room is being prepared, so we decided to go down to the pool bar, get some lunch and gather our bearings on the local area.We got a phone call maybe 1 hour after arriving to let us know our room was ready. We collected our luggage and made our way to the room. We were not offered any help with our luggage nor were we directed to the room (not 4 star service).Upon entering the room it seemed clean, fairly decent in size and basic.It was only after the first couple of days did we start to notice issues, holes in the towels and bedding, toiletries not being refreshed and no complementary bottled water. Now for a 4 star rated hotel we thought this was completely off. These are pretty basic services and facilities, yet the Pestana didn't deliver. Maybe the Portuguese star rating for hotels is slightly different to hotels elsewhere?However, the biggest issue we experienced was house keeping leaving our hotel room completely wide open and leaving it like that for an unknown amount of time. This was whilst we were out.We notified reception and to be fair the Guest Service Manager tried to deal with the situation as best as she could. However it left us feeling very uncomfortable and uneasy that we checked out three days early and moved to a different hotel.Overall, the Pestana Viking is NOT a 4 star hotel under any circumstances, the little touches are missing and the service delivery needs looking at. It wouldn't take many changes to up the quality and improve guest experience. The location of the hotel is great, and some of the staff are too.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,2
Memoria Porto FLH Hotels,Kim M,24,Kim Mwrote a review Dec 2024,"Absolutely the best hotel during our stay in Portugal!  Our stay started with a port wine at checkin with Carla, who was super friendly and helpful to find a terrific restaurant close by. Location is just perfect, across from the river, and close to Ribeira, but easy to walk to the downtown area too! Breakfast was yummy, and loved the small touches of offering sweets later in the afternoon and early evening. Water every day, beds were comfy and room was great. We stayed for 3 nites and highly recommend staying here!!",Dec,2024,Dec 2024,2024-12-01,2024,5
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,VCoop,5,VCoopwrote a review Apr 2019,"Under normal circumstance I’m sure this hotel is very comfortable, especially when there is no building work going on. The building work we had to put up with did hinder our holiday and I’m sure it had an impact on the hotel providing a comfortable stay. We were aware the building work was going on and were told by Jet2 one week before we arrived, which was too late to make any drastic changes to another hotel. The hotel was noisy and dusty around the pool area. Sun beds were uncomfortable with no padded cushions. No doubt all tucked away during the building work and little consideration given by the hotel on the lack of comfort around the pool. In fact a relative recommended this hotel for its comfort, especially around the pool area with fantastic seating etc but unfortunately we didn’t see any comfortable areas. Pool was very cold to use and we were told that we could use the indoor pool but were expected to pay €11 each per day. We thought this charge was a little too much to ask, especially with the building work in place. No outdoor seats to capture the nice weather to sit and read and have a drink. The only option was in the indoor areas which wasn’t always appealing, with repetitive music playing. We also like sitting outside to have a beverages but sadly no seating available. We found ourselves having to walk out of the hotel to try and find outdoor seating for coffees and general drinks. Evening meal was good quality but very predictable. No provision for us to pay a little extra for the a la carte. It was either buffet meal or pay full price for the a la carte. Most hotels we’ve stayed in allow a supplementary payment for a la carte but this request was rejected.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,2

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,TMTC,6,TMTCwrote a review Feb 2017,"I have traveled the world and never experienced such a negative hotel stay. There are many options in Algarve; I would advise families to stay away from this option. There are two hotel policies that are just unacceptable...1. The hotel does not allow you to have a soft drink purchased from outside of the hotel in any of the public areas. 2. The hotel charges 11€ per day for use of the indoor pool, even in the off season when the outdoor pool is inoperable. Children are only allowed in the indoor pool between 11-3pm. But they still must pay 11€. When I spoke to the manager on duty he stated that the \"adult guests do not like children in the indoor pool area because children they make too much noise\", and that \"most guests are very happy with their policies\". He also added that most hotels have the same drink policy although as a world traveller this is the first time I have ever experienced this \"policy\". The manager went on the explain that he is \"sorry I was disappointed, but hope that my being dissatisfied with two things would not ruin my experience\". Needless to say it did...the most disappointing part was the managers attitude toward my dissatisfaction. He came across as if I was just one person and I was wasting his time because my concerns were not shared by other guests. I personally find it difficult to believe that we are the first family to be concerned about these policies. Nevertheless, I will never stay in this hotel again, nor will I ever recommend it to other travellers.",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,1

Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,AvidTravs,137,AvidTravswrote a review Jul 2018,"This hotel has the best most peaceful view I've ever seen. Make sure you get an ocean-facing room....it's worth it. We came to Sao Miguel during the off-season so the hotel and nearby town were not busy. There's a lovely path along the cliffs in front of the hotel which we either ran or walked on everyday. The hotel itself is very clean with modern updates, and serves an excellent breakfast with many fresh options.However, I would avoid the restaurant...expensive, and not very good. The outdoor pool is not heated, which was unfortunate because it would have been great to swim outside and watch the sun set. The rooms are beautiful, but the set up is rather odd...the bathroom and bedroom are separated by a pane of glass (there's a blind that comes down, but it doesn't do much to block the view). We didn't care, but this might be awkward for some who don't want people to see them using the toilet! Other than these minor issues, we had a great stay.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,4
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,BennyMalaga,3591,BennyMalagawrote a review Sep 2012,Our room was No. 307. This was a large room but without a view. The view was the roof of the lower floors. I would ask for a room on the higher floors.There were two twin beds that were very comfortable. There was a desk with internet and electrical outlets. The desk chair was upholstered with gold leather. The headboard was also upholstered with the same gold material. There was a club chair upholstered with a brown fabric. The closet was large. The bathroom was large with a double sink. However the bathtub was a bit dangerous to get in and out. There was a separate room with a toilet and bidet. There was a large TV mounted on the wall.The breakfast buffet was quite good and had many hot entrees. There was also esfumante (bubbly wine) available.The desk was very friendly and the service was efficient and friendly.Adjacent to the hotel was a large supermarket.The hotel was in a good district but a bit far from downtown. Cost of a taxi to downtown was about 6 euros.,Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,3
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,barbara w,82,barbara wwrote a review Jun 2015,"We stayed at this business orientated hotel for 6 nights on a special offer to enjoy Porto. We had an executive room  - spacious and soundproof which made for a peaceful night. Breakfast wasn\"t included, but we took it even though it was expensive - good choices of dishes, breads and fruit.There is a superb roof terrace for sitting, drinking and/or snacking - not cheap, but great views.The water scam involves placing a couple of glass 'flasks' on the room desk, ostensibly the free water many such hotels offer. Somewhere on them, we were told on leaving, is mention of a â‚¬5 charge. Hence they charged us â‚¬20 for a small amount of filtered tap water. After a rant and demanding to see the manager, our cash was returned. Obviously expense accounts just pay.The hotel is just over half a mile from the nearest metro, though a coast bus runs past the door. It demands a â‚¬50 a day tab which it takes from your card and returns any surplus at the end. We refused this dodgy practice by paying cash as we went.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,2
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Dina L,18,Dina Lwrote a review Aug 2015,"Hotel is lovely and clean.  Great location.  Only a short walk to the ferry which takes you to the Island of Tavira, which is where the beach is.  Its also a short walk to the river front which has several shops and restaurants.  Hotel has a great pool area with lounge chairs and easy access to an indoor bar/lounge.  Please note, we did not spend very much time here since we came for the beaches...not the pool!  Our stay included breakfast, which was a wonderful spread of fruits, breads, yogurts, scrambled eggs, hams, and they had a crepe station.  Simply delicious!  The restaurant also has a buffet for dinner, which we tried the first night we arrived since everyone was too tired to venture out.  The buffet was ok.  Nothing amazing, but just fine for 4 adults and 2 kids who had been in a car for several hours!!  The following night we dined at a great restaurant away from the \"tourist\" area and the food was wonderful.  True Portuguese cuisine at its finest!  The only negative part of the hotel for me were the beds.  Not the most comfortable and on the hard side.  Other than this, I would recommend the hotel and Tavira.  It is not over crowded like the rest of the Algarve!  I would definitely return.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,4

Hotel do Parque is set in a park with lake and picnic places so plenty of scope for walking locally (there are a lot of tourists around the hotel during the day) but it is quite a way out of the centre of Braga and on a hill, so without a car it's not an easy journey into town.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,SmithS&B,68,SmithS&Bwrote a review Aug 2014,"We booked a last minute, 5 night break at the Vila Gale Tavira in August. We arrived just before midday and we were told to come back around 2:30pm as the room wasn't ready! They reluctantly took our cases after I had to actually ask if they would!!When we finally got checked in after a nice stroll around Tavira, our room, 1037, was on the bottom floor. The rooms are okay and comfortable, decent choice of TV channels and a fridge which had two bottles of still water and an empty sparkling one!they were duly removed and replaced by our own choices of beverages!The bathrooms are okay, but beware of the showers! There is a glass shower screen, no curtain and that's it, but when you get out of the shower, as my wife found out, water gets all over the floor and she slipped, luckily avoiding a serious injury! The hotel was fully booked and we couldn't get a room change, which we found strange as we heard no one next door or above until the last two nights! The rooms are poorly soundproofed, as the conversations of our family of foreign neighbours could be heard clearly for the last two nights and the constant furniture arranging of the people above!*NOTE TO FURNITURE ARRANGING PEOPLE* When on holiday, leave the furniture where it is!!!The pool area is nice, but it gets crazy busy and there's no real chance of relaxing unless you take your headphones and listen to your favourite holiday tunes!Going back to our room, it was next to an exit door to a corridor which was used as a sprint track by kids, using the doors as brakes, right up to after midnight, who obviously didn't read the 'ssh' signs!We ate breakfast in the hotel, buffet style, and the food on offer was actually really good! Yes, that is a plus point for us!Only a handful of the hotel staff were really pleasant, but there is a lot, lot more the management and all the staff should and can do and this could be a really good little hotel.",Aug,2014,Aug 2014,2014-08-01,2014,3

So we had to move room the room we got moved too was up loads of steps no lifts I was with my elderly nanny. Really not suitable if you arnt great on your feet when we got into are room the safe and fridge was broken. We then rang reception and they said there would be someone to fix it and no one appeared the all inclusive food is absolutely disgusting itâ€™s very cold the same stuff everyday. There is also not enough sun-beds beside the pools so make sure your down early for a sunbed, after a week of being here it was fine to leave towels on your sun-bed before going for breakfast they have now brought a new rule were you canâ€™t leave towels. When you are lying beside the pool it is not relaxing as loud people in the pool throwing a ball around what hit me a few times.At night bring ear plugs very loud music the walls are paper thin. There is also a poster in your room what says you can keep your room on as itâ€™s early check out but when you ask about this they say itâ€™s unavailable.  The cloths horse outside to hang up ur wet clothes was also broke I have been here a week and I have bearly got any sleep with the loud noise of music and drunk people. The reception staff are no help whatsoever. Your room does not be cleaned everyday. If you are looking a supermarket or to get to a restaurant everything is up steep hills I took my granny on a relaxing trip and this was not relaxing at all DO NOT RECOMMEND !!!!!",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,1
Myriad By Sana,i0kan,335,i0kanwrote a review Dec 2015,"When you arrive in Lisbon by airplane, you may already have seen the hotel Myriad from the sky. The building looks like a big white sail and it's a real landmark in Losbon. The hotel located beautifully on the river bank in the area of the former world fair.On the inside the building doesn't disappoint either with a huge lobby and glass elevators. After opening the door of my room (#1112) I was stunned! The room is large and has a very original layout with a glass wall separating the bathroom and bedroom, a desk facing the window, a bed facing the window and a lazy chair that hangs from the ceiling. Art works and beautiful materials give the finishing touch. What the beautiful place!The room was quiet, I never heard any sound from the hallway or the neighbours. The television works well and the wifi was fast enough to have a video-chat with my home base.However, when it comes to details (the difference between a good and a perfect hotel), the Myriad disappointed. The window opens, but on the ledge outside I found a screw. Where did it come from? Anything out there about to let go? The panels around the bathtub were glued on very poorly, exposing either big voids or blobs of glue.While impressed with the room, it was the restaurant that really won me over. In Southern Europe most chefs don't know how to cater for vegans or vegetarians. They always seem to offer the same \"emergency\" menu (fried vegetables and/or stuffed eggplant). So I was pleasantly surprised when the restaurant of the Myriad hotel presented me with spaghetti, well prepared artichoke and tofu (yes, really actual tofu in Portugal; it can be done!). Kudos to the chef!Breakfast was also okay with (somewhat) fresh bread, nuts and fresh orange juice.",Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,4
