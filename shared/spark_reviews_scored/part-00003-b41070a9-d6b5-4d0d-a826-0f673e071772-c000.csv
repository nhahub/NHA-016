Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,jacqhey,0,jacqheywrote a review May 2023,Nice hotel but like holidaying in a creche. No adults only areas! It was a lovely room with fridge and kettle and comfortable bed. Food was not the best quality and barely warm. Had to use the microwave to warm it up.,May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,3

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Alexis M,0,Alexis Mwrote a review Aug 2024,"Scenery surrounding the hotel is beautiful, but the hotel itself is certainly not as luxurious as it claims to be. The hotel staff is extremely rude and unwilling to help guests. I had multiple negative experiences with Marcia at the front desk. Most importantly, our AC was broken in our room for 80% of our trip and our room was over 85 degrees as we visited in August. We spoke to her about this several times and there was never any attempt to help alleviate the situation; we had to ask for a fan two nights in a row before finally getting one. The proper customer service would be a credit on our bill or a complimentary meal at one of their very expensive restaurants. Would not recommend!",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,2
Macarico Beach Hotel,Bro44,0,Bro44wrote a review Jun 2023,"This is an amazingly good hotel for such a small beach resort. Very happy and efficient check-in, a basic but comfortable room.

Pestana Vila Lido,scareyCornwall,98,scareyCornwallwrote a review Dec 2023,"We  have just returned from a 12 night stay at Pestana Lido, this was our 10th holiday to Funchal, having previously stayed once at Pestana Casino, a few times at a family members apartment and 5 times at Hotel Santa Maria, which is the hotel I would compare it with. We found the hotel last year when using the lido and thought we would give it a try.We had a very warm welcome on arrival from reception and were taken to our room with our luggage. We were in room 311 on the 3rd floor which faces the lido so we had full sun on our balcony from lunchtime so it was perfect for enjoying a glass of wine in the evening. First impressions were that the room was spacious, bright and modern looking.The hotel is separated into 2 parts, the modern part houses the rooms, the Flor do Mar Restaurant which has the most breath taking views and is without question the best part of the hotel, our daily breakfasts were an absolute joy, and the food selection was fantastic. Despite being advertised as serving dinner it was not open for the duration of our stay. The gym is also in this building, as is the sauna & turkish bath, these were also not open, and the lifts take you down to the pool and pool bar.The older part of the hotel is where you will find reception, the library, a games room, Vila Lido Restaurant & bar. This building is stunning, spotlessly clean with fantastic views. Sadly this was the only place you could have an evening meal during our stay and we were told that there was only seating for around 30 guests, additionally it was a requirement for men to wear trousers, my husband only wears smart shorts and a shirt so we were unable to eat there. We sensed a bit of a cliquey atmosphere in the bar area and the tables outside so we did not stay for pre or post dinner drinks, additionally we only heard some music on 2 occasions. We have always enjoyed pre & post dinner drinks plus nightly entertainment at the Santa Maria and we missed this very much. Despite this being a lovely building it feels very disjointed from the rest of the hotel and you don't get the feeling you are actually staying in a hotel, it was more like going into a serviced apartment.The good points - good location, fantastic sea views, nice staff, lovely pool area, large supermarket across the road, bus stop at top of the hill, lots of eateries close by, amazing breakfast.The bad points - the bed. Terrible! While beds are a very individual thing, by the 2nd night my back was in so much pain, staff put a large duvet cover folded into 4 as a mattress topper, which was also needed on my husbands side, but it made no difference just a very very hot night. I barely slept for my whole holiday, the staff said it was because the beds were new!While the hotel was spotlessly clean throughout, our room was not. On arrival the windows and patio doors were very dirty and not cleaned at all. The first day I dropped an earring in the bathroom and was shocked to see a large amount of dust under the sink, it was still there when we left. The surfaces in the bedroom were not cleaned at all. The toilet was 'cleaned' every 4/5 days, our shower flooded the bathroom 3 times due to the trap being blocked, we had to ask for it to be cleared. The shower was not cleaned for the duration of the stay. I am a B&B owner so I can speak about the cleanliness from experience and with my own standards.Considering the hotel has just had a total refurbishment there are things that have been badly thought out. While the brand new fabric headboards look lovely now they will be totally impractical for cleaning and hygiene issues in the coming months/years. No USB ports anywhere in the room, only one spare plug socket which was in a very unusable position in the room, no mirror to use while sitting doing hair, make up etc. The tap was positioned too far back on the sink making the pop up waste very difficult to access and water went everywhere making all your items on the marble top soaking wet every time you used it. The plug did not keep the water in the sink and when shaving you had to keep the tap running which is a total waste of resources and not in keeping with 'Pestana Plant Guests' advice. The emphasis has been too much about looking modern, there is absolutely no comfort - the bed was one of the worse we have slept in, the sofa, the balcony chairs, the room chair and sunbeds were awful. The 2 best chairs we sat on were outside the lifts on the pool and restaurant levels where no one sat!Madeira never lets us down as a holiday destination, the weather was fantastic, as was the food and a lot of the hotel. But there were some issues particularly the comfort factor, so we are unsure if we would stay again, sadly. Additionally the hotel was only 30-40% full, so not sure how restaurant and pool area would be if hotel was full.I have submitted a detailed review due to the discussions I had with a few staff members.",Dec,2023,Dec 2023,2023-12-01,2023,4

Communication from team and recommendations excellent. Paid for the optional breakfast on first morning - it was very good (rolls, pastries, yoghurt, eggs, fruit, cereal etc.) and generous portions.

PortoBay Serra Golf,FlyingPigPorksville,58,FlyingPigPorksvillewrote a review Jan 2015,"This is a lovely hotel in the mountains, excellent value and good food. The only thing that let it down was a strong smell of sewage in our room, which was the 2 bedroom apartment. We pointed it out when we arrived, though there was no follow up so we pointed it out again in the evening (to a different member of staff). In the end, we were moved to two standard rooms which were fine, though not what we had planned as we wanted to spend the evening with our friends with some privacy.The staff did their best to make it up, offering us a drink each and 25% discount on dinner.Problems can obviously occur with any property, though this should have been sorted out sooner and the fact that staff didn't notice it and do something about it before our arrival is very poor as the smell was strong and went into the communal area (lobby and restaurant toilets) next to the apartment. Clearly the cleaner noticed as the smell of sewage was accompanied with air freshener.Had it not been for the above, this review would have warranted an 'excellent'.",Jan,2015,Jan 2015,2015-01-01,2015,4

Pool bar never opened, the only other bar didnt open till 4pm, no snacks available that we seen, ate there on 1st morning to receive a frozen cold breakfast.

Quinta do Mel,Lorienaway,6,Lorienawaywrote a review Jul 2016,This little oasis of calm is just a short distance from Falesia nestled amid a few fields of grazing goats and kitchen garden plots. The sign for agri tourism says it all. Home grown local produce made to finger licking perfection!We have been there twice for lunch and it just gets better. The tapas selection is great. We particularly liked the goats cheese waffles and the shrimps in honey sauce almost had us taking the paint off the pottery bowl trying to soak up the last remnants of sauce. Delicious!!It may be hard to find but its well worth the search! Very close to Epic Sauna and Pine Cliffs resorts !,Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Maimeo,49,Maimeowrote a review Dec 2011,"Beautiful hotel with very, very nice rooms.  Quiet,  Nice lobby bar that extends to a great patio.The on-site restaurant is very convenient and has very good food.  Watch for the seasonal buffet dinners nightly that are quite reasonable.  There were pasta, appetizer, salad, bread, seafood and dessert stations and everything we ate was delicious.  Likewise the breakfast buffet is quite reasonable, but they don't skimp on quantity or quality of the food: eggs, waffles, pastries, meats, cheeses, fresh fruits and juices and made-to-order specialty coffees.Convenient to the airport but not so close to city center.  We took a taxi to catch a \"hop-on/hop-off\" bus that got us around the city pretty easily.",Dec,2011,Dec 2011,2011-12-01,2011,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Sinead M,58,Sinead Mwrote a review Aug 2016,I have stayed in many Marriott's and this one has the same lovely layout and rooms. Bed was lovely. The wifi is not strong enough in the rooms though which we rang and complained so if u want to do business work you will need to go to the lobby. The pool could also do with a clean there was a good few leaves in it but apart from that was lovely. It is a bit out of town but taxis are only like €7 in and the tour bus is just down the hill at the zoo. The executive lounge only had one beer and one red or white wine the last Marriott I was in you had much more selection so think this can be improved. So all in all it is a nice hotel but would not be saying it is spectacular.,Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,ganotrill,38,ganotrillwrote a review Jun 2015,"I checked into a Junior Suite on the 17th floor of this 18 floor high Marriott and was initially impressed with the room. The next morning I woke up to hear what sounded like Jackhammers. I was informed by the guy behind the front desk that the roof was being renovated and to be honest he did not seem to really care that my stay had turned into a nightmare ( I am a business traveller and work during the day on the net in my room)I finally found a hotel staff member who did give a damn about my experience in the junior suite and relocated me to a regular room with NO NOISE. That was around 10 am of the second day. By 7pm the net had become very slow in my room. I crashed out for a few hours and woke at midnite hoping with most people asleep the net would be OK.It was not. I couldn't even load a page. I went down to the front desk and was informed by the staff that what I needed was a code to get high speed access and the guy would come up and get it working in my room. He had almost zero experience with what he was doing, finally got the code accepted and guess what? NO CHANGE. I did a test with speedtest.net and found almost zero upload and told the employee he needed to contact the internet service provider as something looked wrong. I think he ignored me.By 8am the net had slowed to zero again. While grabbing a coffee I talked to a guest who was an IT professional from Washington DC who said he had zero connectivity also and had personally phoned the internet service provider (who did not fix the problem)In addition to this I met a 2nd guest who was working on the net in the executive lounge because he couldn't get an adequate connection in his room.I checked out an hour later and cancelled 12 days of bookings with this hotel. I do not expect to see any financial compensation from this hotel. At best they might offer me a few points which is only of use if I ever stay at a Marriott again and believe me I never want to see the inside of a Marriott hotel room again.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,1
Hyatt Regency Lisbon,Clarence K,7,Clarence Kwrote a review Mar 2025,"Very nice hotel in a great location with very friendly and helpful staff.  I'd especially recommend the breakfast to start your day:  great buffet, fresh food, great staff, good value.  The gym has complete cardio and weight machines and is open 24 hours.  We had a car and the parking directly below the hotel was very convenient for our trips to Sintra and beaches.  Heading into Lisbon we took Uber which seemed the most convenient and economical (and avoids parking hassle).

Royal Savoy Hotel,ForBusinessAndFun,26,ForBusinessAndFunwrote a review Nov 2007,"I stayed a week at Royal Savoy in early November, in one of the bottom floor studios. I paid €250 for seven days -this was a flybuy offer, i.e. I had to promise in advance to take part in a time share presentation. The presentation took some 3 hours, and I didn't buy a timeshare (basically because time share contracts turned out to be for 25 years only, meaning that you actually don't own a time share, you just pay 25 years of hotel bills in advance).The Royal Savoy is of high standard, pool area is splendid and well-kept but saunas are almost cold, small and disappointing. Reception staff is not overtly friendly, at check-in I was given key cards that did not work and had to return to the reception and ask for new, and staff did not apologise. Rooms are nicely decorated, and cleaning service is of high standard. Bathroom was spacious, and of five star class. There was a kitchenette with dishwasher in my room and kitchen utensils, but there are plenty of reasonably priced restaurants around. The hotel does not offer wireless internet anywhere, and guests are referred to the lobby of old Hotel Savoy where free wireless is available (as well as in the pub of the neigbouring Carlton Hotel). In November, all the other guests seemed to be retired couples, mostly from UK and the Nordic countries, very few kids. The ambience was very quiet and calm, and perfect for a relaxing holiday. The bar and lobby area on bottom and first floor are cozy, with live piano music. However, the dress code was a bit too formal for me, for men some kind jacket was expected for dinner.Most of the property is time shares, and even more rooms have now been diverted from the hotel business to time shares. The ongoing business with an endless stream of couples being shown the premises by time share salespeople is a bit disturbing.Location is very good, immediately by the sea, and 15-20 min walk from city centre. Airport bus (€5) stops by the hotel. Even in november the temperature was pleasant, good for leveda hiking, and I had to days of good sunshine.The stay was definitely worth the price I paid, but I wouldn't pay the official rate, which was said to be €250 per night.",Nov,2007,Nov 2007,2007-11-01,2007,2

The sea facing suites are great, and the view from my fourth floor balcony was fantastic. It overlooked the harbour with cruise ships elegantly coming and going almost on a daily basis. The hotel has entertainment each evening ranging from jazz saxophonist to singers and pianists playing all the classics. The hotel was not crowded and pool and facilities were excellent and clean! My parents introduced me to the Island having visited over 45 years ago for their first trip and fell in love with Madeira like many others. Happy hour is worth a visit in the cocktail bar as are the restaurants. Christmas Luncheon was traditional and excellent value with a lively atmosphere and sunshine!!!",Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,5
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Andy S,137,Andy Swrote a review Sep 2021,"This hotel can be different things to different people; it's very different from the other 'eggbox' modern mega-hotels along the coastline near Funchal.Much of grandeur and character is maintained which gives a quite exclusive and prestigious feel throughout. However there were several minor but fixable issues with this stay that reduced my rating to 4 out of 5.The positives;- staff friendly and enthusiastic.- various mini sundecks by the sea, so you can get a 'private' feeling. Likewise the building layout gives floors and rooms a boutique feel.- excellent kid's club - my 7 yr old said it was the best part of the holiday.- 2 good-sized pools, one fresh one saline, proper sloping depth from 1M to 2.5M- cleanliness good, good quality (albeit old) fixtures and fittings.- 20 mins walk from Funchal centre, 10 mins walk along from an incredibly wide variety of very good restaurants.- variety of fruit available all day for free, and mini bar soft drinks were free.- generous toiletries allocation, hand clothes etc.- breakfast is buffet style, but there were daily on-order options and table service for teas, juices, water etc. Breakfast items overall high quality, very wide choice, hot plates available etc.Issues - all very minor and fixable but in combination harmed the experience;- inconsistent pool-side service - order forgotten or taking far too long e.g. 20-30 mins for drinks.- needs a 3d map to explain the layout and features - there's a verbal explanation that the building is across 2 wings with a connecting floor, but there's so much more to see in the building e.g. the gardens, cocktail bar, various terraces and function rooms, where afternoon tea is held etc.- every bathroom should have a toilet brush.- No practical plug sockets near the bed.- the App needs reviewing so more information and features are available e.g. booking the courtesy bus into town, ordering drinks and food pool-side, the overall structure and layout.- prices are too high - cocktails c £14, pint of local lager £6, 80 min massage c£180.- Some breakfast items need thought to maintaining quality in a buffet e.g. any crisp-fried potato items need to be under a hotlamp to keep them crisp (not allowed to steam-soggy in a chafing dish).",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Sarita B,27,Sarita Bwrote a review Jun 2017,"This hotel needs a lot of improvement before it can be a 5*. I have recently had an operation for cancer and had specially requested a room on an easy access floor. I was given a room on level 2. The hotel breakfast and access to street level was level 5 which meant a long walk up the lobby on level 2 then a lift up to level 5 and then a further walk up to the breakfast, bar or exit to street level. I was rather disappointed that my request did not seem to matter at all and that no thought had been applied to how comfortable I would be. Further more my first room had a problem with the shower which meant my entire room was flooded after I had showered one time (not a great situation for someone that had just had an operation on their leg). This problem took some time to resolve and I had to ask the manager to come and sort this out as the other staff were not able to understand my request. I was then moved to a different room (more packing and unpacking!). The breakfast buffet was ok but not to 5* standard. In addition to this the room I was given was under the kitchen and it was incredibly noisy at some points during the day, to the point where I had to call reception to see what the noise was. I was the told by the reception (after 3 calls) that this was just the routine noise of the air conditioning. This was obviously not the case. The noises I was hearing were from the kitchen of trollies and staff moving around. Other small points like peeling wall paper and bad paint jobs also add to my not a 5* comment. I must say that the hotel is ok and are trying their best and I am hoping these are just teething problems which will be fixed at some point having just had their refurbishment. The Sky bar at the top is great and offers a lovely view. Pool area is also lovely but suffers from \"towel reservation problems\" whereby guests wake up early to reserve sunloungers but do not come back for hours. A problem which I think needs to be solved by the hotel as there are not enough umbrellas available and this is frustrating to say the least . 20 minute walk to the nearest beach. Parking available. Best thing about the hotel AMAZING VIEWS!!",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,3
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Mike S,21,Mike Swrote a review Oct 2015,"My stay at the Tivoli was in October to attend a folk festival which took place in the grounds of the hotel.  Our room was very comfortable, clean and modern.  The food was all inclusive, buffet service and I was happy with everything that was served.  However the range of main dishes for vegetarians was limited.  But when this was pointed out, the response was very positive and my friend was served an individually cooked meal.  Very tasty.   The hotel was very flexible in its approach to the festival and when it rained (only one day) they moved the festival into a large hall.  The location is amazing, perched on the top of a cliff close to a wonderful coastal walk.  The aspect of the hotel is stunning.  Overall, a great experience.",Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,4

Looked clean on first appearance however on closer inspection there was mould around the bottom of the bath panel and lots of dust and grime on the corners. The drains in the bathroom after use smelled awful. The patio doors were disgusting and made a terrible noise due to dirt/grit being stuck in them. The light switch to the bathroom was also faulty,Sep,2024,Sep 2024,2024-09-01,2024,2

Approx €4.5 for a beer cocktails €7-11standard rooms are just that standard -nothing special. Staff friendly and helpful.Breakfast price is a rip off at €25 per person but plenty of places to go locally for breakie.I have stayed using loyalty points a few times and  I have never been upgraded even though top tier level status and was only given one free drink which is poor compare to other ihg hotels.Over all good place though would recommend !!",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4
Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,Maria R,10,Maria Rwrote a review Jan 2018,"Spent 10 days in this hotel in March. We had room 113 - room in the first floor, with garden view. One of the best hotel experiences I had. Super clean (they do not have any carpets and actually mop the floor every day), tastefully furnished, cotton high quality bedding, comfortable high end mattress, and to top all that we could step outside on green grass in a bathrobe! Very quiet, away from any kind of traffic, all you can hear are ocean waves in the distance. I highly recommend this hotel, especially for tourists traveling with kids. You are going to be taken care of! Breakfast buffet is nice, they had everything we like to eat for breakfast, and you do not need to pay extra. Good size indoor pool. In March, outdoor pool was not closed, but it was too cold to swim there. For me, the cleanliness of this hotel and rooms are exceptional and I will definitely go back this year.",Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,5

Arrived at 11.00 am and was orginally told our room would not be available until 2.00 pm, but by 12 our room was ready and we were able to check in and unpack.Apartment very spacious and clean, well equipped kitchen, the lack of a kettle wasn't really a problem and we cooked on several nights. Both the reception staff and bar staff were very polite and friendly, especially Telma and Juci.Pool area and gardens very well kept, the only negative was there didn't seem to be enough umbrellas and sunbeds for the number of people staying there.  We were always around the pool early, so this wasn't particularly a problem for us.Two good supermarkets and several lovely restaurants within 10 minutes of the apartments.These apartments were about 15 minutes away from the strip, so you don't experience all the noise and rowdiness that comes with it.Easy enough to get to places from here - was about 10 euros return trip into old town and 20 euros return trip to Algarve Shopping Centre.Would definitely stay here again.",Sep,2010,Sep 2010,2010-09-01,2010,4

Pestana Viking,Vanessa Caraman... R,51,Vanessa Caraman... Rwrote a review Jun 2025,"The hotel is beautiful, but a bit old. The room meets the basic needs, no luxury. Old furniture. But that would not be a problem for us, because its structure is nice. Very nice pool (although frozen) outside, Even with heat people can not stay long because of the temperature. Leagis chairs and umbrelones. The view to the beach is very beautiful too! Nice indoor pool! Sauna and hydro as well.But there are complicated things, like parking! The parking lot is tiny! There are no vacancies for everyone, that's simple! Be prepared to go search out and away! If you leave at night then it will be impossible to find a vacancy. There was a night we left and when we arrived the staff were outside and when they saw we were looking for vacancy, they ran inside. Anyway...Breakfast is awful. The quality is very bad! Without a doubt, it was the worst coffee of our entire trip to Portugal. I think the Pestana group, for being so well known, should go see what happens there: horrible, dried breads, coffee and machine milk, put a cup so big that it looks like a pot of mingau. Milk and coffee. Anyway, very bad, very bad quality! Who saves some of the breakfast is the Dalton who with his kindness and presence does the only thing really good there: the omelettes, which are made on time! Thank you Dalton for saving our coffee. The rest. Really bad! Details: Nutella is hidden and you need to ask! Yes, believe it! It's real!Recommendation: Do not close the breakfast right away! Go on the first day and see if you like it. Otherwise, there are good nearby options or even markets. Why paying for something bad really isn't worth it?Another thing that also disappointed me was the cleanliness which is very weak! On the first day we had bird coco on our balcony which remained dry until the last day, even asking to clean.Wouldn't host me again!",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,2

Comfortable bed and a decent shower, although having to reach through cold or hot water to adjust the flow/temperature isn’t great and it also didn’t drain properly. No views to speak of but rooms seemed quiet and clean compared to some I’ve stayed at. Breakfast was good but marked down a star due to lack of available cutlery which we had to wait a couple of minutes for after asking for it.

The noise from the street is quite loud, but if you close the window, it is OK. The location of the hotel is excellent, it is right in front of the red metro station Sao Sebastiao (airport line) and the blue line is also nearby, so you can get anyway in Lisbon in no time. The breakfast was really surprisingly good with variety of fruit, cereals, pastry, cheeses etc., good coffee and juices as well.

Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,Steve W,19,Steve Wwrote a review Oct 2013,"We chose the Bellevue Number 1 apartments mainly from comments here on Tripadvisor. However, as good as the comments here are, none fully justify simply how wonderful these apartments and location are. Superb hosts in Dieter and Ziggy, working all day every day to ensure everything is perfect. We stayed in apartment number 5 which is beautifully furnished, comfortable and open. It has a vast great balcony which is a sun trap and difficult to leave. However, the pool area is simply an oasis, quiet, relaxing and a riot of colour. Because of its setting it is easy to meet and enjoy the company of others holidaying at the apartments. We were extremely lucky with glorious weather in October and spent many hours relaxing poolside. The Bellevue apartments are an ideal location in Carvoeiro for restaurants and bars and exploring the local area. We will definitely return to recharge the batteries and look forward to doing so soonest. With many grateful thanks to Dieter and Ziggy.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,4
