Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Nicola R,0,Nicola Rwrote a review Oct 2019,"Everything about this hotel was fantastic, the rooms are lovely and clean, the waterpark is brilliant, there was a good selection of food available, the only thing was the queues at meal times that let it down.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Michelle J,1,Michelle Jwrote a review May 2022,Great hotel for good family fun. Entertainment was spot on for 7 and 10 year olds from round the pool activities to the evening shows. Good food with a great choice and excellent fuss free service.

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,blueberlin04,5,blueberlin04wrote a review Aug 2018,"We stayed for a week with teenagers and had a great time. The apartment was spotless and just by one of the 4 pools. We had a massive terrace with table, chairs and an airer and only had to go down some steps to reach the pool, which was amazing for the kids. The restaurant was nice as well - they do themed nights at £24 per adult and £12 per child, including drinks. Fantastic value (we went to the Fado Night and had 2 bottles of wine!) It's really close to Praia da Porto de Mos, although we did not venture there until the evenings. All in all a great and relaxing break, definitely recommended.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Frarling1981,7,Frarling1981wrote a review Aug 2021,"The good: amazing location, lovely interiors, great rooftop bar, friendly staff, clean, lovely room, delicious food and wine.The bad: the waiting for the food was too long on many occasions (and the food is very expensive), the kids club was left unsupervised and no activities were organised for children (it's more for toddlers than for older children), generally a bit disorganised really, and just a bit off the description on their website. The room above ours had building work being carried out, lots of drilling during the day. Not a 5 star hotel, more like a 4 star.Not the hotel's fault, just FYI but the beach & sea was full of algae during the day so we couldn't go there. We made the most of the pool though, and had a great time. There is another beach 10 mins walk which is fantastic.",Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,4

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Kristina B,83,Kristina Bwrote a review Aug 2023,"The hotel is beautiful, has 3 similar outdoor pools and one additional outdoor for adults only. One indoor pool (kids allowed) and saunas for adults only. The water in the pools is ice cold, very unpleasant to swim, even kids couldn’t stay longer than a minute in the pool and that is in the month of August.The room we had was spacious and with a beautiful view. It was quite a disappointment that there were not toiletteries except for shower gel and towels are changed only twice a week. Also for pool towels you cant change them during the day, which is annoying if you went to the beach in the morning. The cleaning of the room was not great, the traces of hairmask from the first day were never removed in the bath until the last day.The beach is 2 min walk from the hotel and is wonderful.The breakfast is sober but good enough.There is free parking. Wifi is pretty good.It’s only 9 min drive till centre of lagos and 5 min drive till Lidl supermarket. Its 30 min drive till nice aqua-parks.The pool bar is not impressive, the smoothy which you expect to be fresh was made out of pre-packed mix.All in all it was a pleasant but way to overpriced stay with some disappointments.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,3
1e Carvoeiro,marysteven,67,marystevenwrote a review Jul 2017,"Stayed here at the end of June with our CLC points. Was given a two storey apartment by the main pool.  It was an excellent property.  However we had to wait until 5:45 pm to gain access to it as it hadn't been cleaned. 4 pm is the advertised time to gain access to your room so we were almost 2 hours late getting in having arrived at 2:00The back led out down a path to the pool area. Apart from four young German guys who spent most of their time drinking and talking extremely loudly around the pool during the day, it was very pleasant by the pool.  However the bar by the pool is excellent and nice to sit outside on their poolside tables.The shop by the reception had closed down so it was awkward to carry any provisions up the steep climb from the town.There are plenty eating places on site but we chose to eat in the town so can't comment.One word of warning, if you have a late flight, the showers by the pool in the toilets don't have hot water.  The hot taps have been removed.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,3
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Prime85,38,Prime85wrote a review Jun 2019,"I recently stopped here with some friends for our annual break.Let me start by saying this is a very nice hotel, buts it’s not a 5 star hotel - it’s more 3 and a half to 4 star, nonetheless it’s nice.The hotel rooms are very big. We had 4 rooms between us and some of the rooms were better than the other - it’s clear they are renovating some of the rooms, some of them didn’t have TVs in the bedroom for example, and our room didn’t have an air conditioning remote.The staff are nice and friendly - always willing to help.The pool area is nice, however the sun beds need replacing and more of them, as there aren’t enough for everyone! Be prepared when jumping into the pool - it’s very very cold!Pool bar and main bar are nice - you can get a beer for 2 euros in the happy hour! Although the pool bar closes early, so you’ll have to then go to the main bar.The Location is great - 15 minute walk to Old Town and to 10 minute walk to New Town.  The hotel has its own taxi service so that’s a plus.There is a supermarket and a few restaurants near by - all very cheap and within a 2 minute walk.All in all - a decent hotel, one to which I would return, buts its definitely not 5 star.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,3

Lisbon Destination Hostel,emiyoshi,12,emiyoshiwrote a review Jan 2018,"+ My stay lasted four days and I enjoyed my time at the Hostel. The staff was always helpful and encouraged the guests to come to the evening events to socialize.+ The common area is playfully (hammock, pool table etc.) furnished and is the best way to socialize with other guests.+ Breakfast is free and has a diverse offer (Pancakes, toast, bread, jams, cheese etc.).+ The location is central and sightseeing things are easily accessible from Rossio station by foot.- Just one small detail - in the bathroom (1st floor) needs to be more space to put down your belongings while showering/cleaning your teeth etc.",Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,4
The Boliqueime Inn Hotel,Valerie L,104,Valerie Lwrote a review Jun 2017,"We had booked here because we had heard good reports about the restaurant. Unfortunately the chef was incapacitated so only breakfast was on offer. They are still producing an excellent Sunday Roast dinner but we missed that unfortunately.The new owners are really friendly and welcoming and the rooms are comfortable, with air conditioning. The bathrooms are scheduled to be updated, although the retro feel adds to the charm!The Inn is lovely, there is a peaceful pool area and parking on site.  We had a pleasant stay and were directed to a nearby restaurant for our evening meal. I am sure the kitchen will be back in action again shortly and we will make sure we come back to stay next year. Boliqueime is a nice change from the coastal mayhem but is an easy drive to the coast and golf areas.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4

Reid’s Palace is located in a wonderful part of the island, overlooking the ocean and surrounded by serene gardens. The common areas are what one would expect of a hotel with the word “palace” in the name. The room was very comfortable, and opened up to the gardens, with a great view of the ocean.

On this latest January visit I was so impressed with the continued quality of the location - the structure,the gardens,the facilities. They spend their maintenance income wisely with ongoing refurb keeping the customer happy. The villas are spacious, modern and attractive. The clubhouse staff are great. It was too cold to use the outdoor pools but we were very happy with the indoor pool, hot jacuzzi and dry/steam sauna. A superb week.",Jan,2013,Jan 2013,2013-01-01,2013,4
Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,ACBross,1,ACBrosswrote a review May 2014,I loved this hostel because the entire time I felt like I was staying with friends. They fed me so well and then I would sit and hang out with the staff. I never felt uncomfortable or unwanted. The hostel is very clean and the decorations are just what you imagined a surf hostel would look like (maybe even nicer). I could walk to the beaches or city center and if I wanted to got kayaking or take surf lessons they would set it up for me. I liked it so much I cancelled a night in another city so I could stay one more day there.,May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,5

Excellent buffet spread catering for all tastes.As you get older (!) birthdays tend to be ignored with the passage of time, but the Hotel very kindly had a cake and bottle of 'bubbles' placed in our room. This was a very thoughtful touch and it is part of why The Porto Bay group is so special to us.Highly recommend this hotel, only a 10/15 min walk to the promenade/harbour area.",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,5

Amazingly beautiful view but unfortunately today it was a bit windy so we didn't manage to linger as long as I'd liked. Staff very friendly and attentive. Felt like a film star for the afternoon, dressing up and just enjoyed it. Will be back on our next holiday here.

There is a deck area with classy deck chairs where you can feast to the stunning views. But the tour was disappointing.

The rooms are all rather small but nicely decorated with modern and very good taste. Small bathroom but nice as well. Breakfast was better than expected and contrary to some reviews the breakfast room is rather big, the hotel was full and never had a problem to find a table. Really fantastic fresh fruits for breakfast (that made the difference to other hotel breakfasts). A very good ratio price/quality.

Pateo Lisbon Lounge Suites,Kathy M,3,Kathy Mwrote a review Jul 2013,"We were so pleased to find a lovely, modern apartment with LOTS of space for our four night stay in Lisbon.  It cost less than the priciest hotels, and had both parking and a pool area.  It lived up to its billing in every way.  Unfortunately, we visited during a new event for the neighborhood--the three-day \"Mouraria Light Walk,\" a lovely event in many ways, with people wandering the streets at night and various light shows.  HOWEVER, the main event for the light walk was a live concert in the plaza RIGHT next to our room, with a disk jockey starting at 12:30 and going until 2:00 a.m.  It was like sleeping in a Disco hall.  On the nights when this wasn't happening, it was absolutely quiet.  The owners were unaware that this event was going to happen (they learned about it the day we arrived).  And it was a \"first annual\" event.  So beware next July 18-20!  Fortunately, the owners were able to give us a small room at another one of their properties so that we could get a good night's sleep on July 20 (after two sleepless nights, we were ready!).  We appreciated that they accommodated us in this way.Although we were on our own, I think this property is ideal for families visiting Lisbon because the pool was a great way for kids to take a break.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,4

We are vegetarians, and as expected, the food wasn't all that good, although I did really  enjoy the salads on offer in the restaurant the only protein was a few slices of cheese - which were meant instead of a pudding but were OK with salad.

A few things let this hotel down firstly the food, breakfast was always cold or at most lukewarm, and the lunch was awful, and expensive! They also charged for the pool table and when leaving for a late flight, they charged us 5 euros each for a shower! Not classy for this chain of hotels!",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4

Reception staff were most helpful as were the staff on entry to the dinning room and the girls doing the cleaning. The other staff looked as though they just wanted to get the job done and go home.

Spacious and exceptionally clean room with amazing views of the coastline.  Breakfast was probably the best buffet breakfast we have had in any hotel with so much choice and everything regularly replenished.  Staff were so helpful and friendly.  I emailed ahead with specific room requests ( I appreciate that this can only ever be a request)  but everyone was met which was very much appreciated.  Plenty of free car parking too was a bonus.Would definitely stay here again.,May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,5
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Johanne M,12,Johanne Mwrote a review Jul 2016,"The Crowne Plaza is a nice hotel, very modern, great location, good facilities. However,  I feel the service at this hotel lets it down and with a few adjustments, this hotel could be great.Breakfast is of good quality and they replenish the food regularly. However, trying to get a tea or coffee in the morning is very hit & miss. As we stayed in a suite we were able to eat breakfast in the smaller restaurant which was suppose to be a privilege, however the service was very poor as they seemed to be always understaffed. We were always chasing for tea/coffee, cutlery, running out of plates etc. So we would normally eat in the larger restaurant as they seemed better equipped. We did find the lady on the front a little rude at times though. On one occasion we queued in the suite restaurant for 10 mins so tried the other restaurant but arrived 10.25 when it closes at 10.30. The front of house lady decided it was appropriate to give me a telling off and saying I should give myself more time, however I tried to explain I had been queuing in the other restaurant. She was rude.The drinks and food prices at the hotel are very expensive even for a 5 star hotel. €3 for a can of coke & €4 for a large bottle of water. I'm sure if the prices were slightly cheaper we would of spent a lot more instead of going to the local spar shop and stocking up.The pool area is nice but the grassed area could do with being improved. The beds around the pool are modern beds with nice cushions but they are very different on the grassed area and not as comfy making the pool beds in high demand. I'm sure if they were to change the beds they wouldn't get the usual reserving of beds at ridiculous time of the morning. There are always plenty of grassed area beds available at any time of day as no one wants to sit on them! Beach towels are ok but are starting to look tired.There is a lady that does Zumba in the pool daily. Although same songs, same dances every day so got very boring, she needs to mix it up.The rooms are lovely though. We stayed in a 2 storey junior suite with a separate living room. Very modern and spacious and 2 bathrooms. It came with a nice Nespresso machine although they provide you with 4 coffee pods but only 2 milks but is replenished daily.  Also 4 small bottles of waters are provided free of charge daily which is a nice touch.We found the staff in all areas of the hotel to be very unfriendly, moody and unhelpful.

Vilas Marrocha,kath L,22,kath Lwrote a review Oct 2018,"We're presently at vila senhora da rocha. We came as a couple for 10 days. I have to admit I was concerned with a couple of negative reviews, but cannot fault the place. Our apartment is pretty basic, but clean and caters for our every need. No air con, but massive fan suffices in what has been tropical weather. One day hitting 40. The staff have proved friendly, and work very hard to ensure our needs were met. The cleaners and maintenance staff in particular worthy of a mention. The grounds spectacular. The reception staff very polite and attentive also. Given best advice for trips etc. There's a free bus that runs 3 times a day to take you into old town, and return to resort. This stops at 5pm but taxis only 6 euros. We went by taxi to Portomao 25 euros each way and went to splash water park which we organised at resort and spent the day. Wish we had booked 2 weeks, honestly don't be put off by negative reviews. We will certainly be back.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,AP,147,APwrote a review Sep 2021,"Stayed at Porto Palacio for 7 nights in Porto with my family. The hotel is located in an alright area, around a 15 minute walk from Francos metro station and a 20 minute walk from Casa da Musica metro station. The stay didnâ€™t get off to the greatest of starts because we had been given the incorrect rooms and had to wait an hour fir replacement rooms. This was very frustrating considering we had just travelled a long distance and we wanted to relax in our rooms. Eventually we got into our rooms which were very nice and modern with a few interesting, unique features, however the safe in our room was broken which meant that a technician had to come and fix it in the evening which was a bit annoying but wasnâ€™t a massive issue.Due to Coronavirus, breakfast was different to what I had experienced in other hotels which is fair enough given the pandemic. There were staff around the buffet, you had to queue up and they would serve you whatever you asked for. This wasnâ€™t a problem but it did create large queues for breakfast serving and it was clear that the staff had too much to do. On the flip side, Rosa who served us at breakfast almost every day was so kind and lovely - a massive thank you to her for everything she did over the course of our 7 days, she was brilliant.In terms of the facilities, again they were a bit up and down. The pool was extremely small in contrast to the gym which was massive. The gym was very good and it had lots of machines and equipment for everyone to use. There were some bizarre rules due to COVID, for example you had to bring a towel with you to the gym otherwise you were refused entry as well as there being no water in the gym due to the pandemic (no water machine or anything like that). We visited the spa pool once which was amazing. The pool was great along with the jacuzzi and water jets in the pool. Some of the other stuff like the hot stone beds were nice however some of the showers werenâ€™t great mainly because they didnâ€™t work properly and the lighting is very dim so you canâ€™t see the controls properly.Apart from the two issues I listed at the beginning of the review, we had one further issue that was persistent throughout our stay. Throughout the day and night, the air conditioning in our room would switch off and considering that Portugal is a hot country, this was extremely hard to deal with especially in the middle of the night. Even after talking to the receptionists, it was a repeat issue throughout the whole 7 nights of our stay.There were a few other staff that I am unsure of their names that were very helpful towards us as well, it is just a shame that we had so many problems with the rooms. I was initially going to place this review at 3 star, however I chose 4 as the stay did progressively get better thanks to a few of the staff who made a large effort to make up for all the issues. Other then that, the hotel is extremely nice with a business/executive style to it.We were probably just unlucky with our visit so I would still recommend staying in Porto Palacio.",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,3

The view from the room was amazing, the food was a different theme every night - asian, gala, indian, Spanish, Portuguese, italian, and Mexican. So much variety at all 3 courses. Clean rooms, good hot water, good cooking facilities. Right on the beach, 3 decent pools and nice gardens, the sauna was lovely too. Two minor complaints, the hot tub was not hot and the doors to the rooms are a little fiddly, other than that a beautiful place that we would visit again. They also left a lovely little gift for my sons 11th birthday which was so nice of them. Great service and polite friendly staff.",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,4

Pestana Viking,Peterdk8000,65,Peterdk8000wrote a review Nov 2017,"We had picked Pestana Viking from the internet, not knowing exactly what to expect.It was outside the main season, so prices were low, but Algarve still warmer that the rest of Europe.With a GPS it was easy to find the hotel. Without it I don't know, the address was not exact.We were received by a very competent receptionist, who used enough time to make us feel welcome and informed us of everything important.All in all we had not very much contact with the staff, but those we talked to were nice and professional.We had booked a suite, and it was very large and very clean with view directly to the Atlantic.The hotel facilities were fine, but we did not use many of them, except for the pools and the sun beds.We did not dine at the hotel, but we had the breakfast buffet, and it was large, but with an average quality.Not enough parking at the hotel, but it was not hard to find free public parking in the neighborhood.The area around the hotel was not very inspiring. But after all people probably go to ALgarve to find the sun and not shop around.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,3
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Jan N,37,Jan Nwrote a review Aug 2011,"Review - Hotel Porto PalacioThis hotel was on our second stop on our drive through Portugal and 2-night stay in the beautiful city of Porto. Â Hotel Porto Palacio is a classy, gorgeous 5-star hotel Â with exceptional rooms and facilities. Â The lobby was warm and inviting, and the staff was extremely friendly, eager to assist, and even offered us a glass of port to welcome us. Â The rooms are ultra-modern, spacious, clean, and comfortable. Â With extras like mints on the pillow, turn-down service, Â slippers by the bedside, heated towel racks, and separate toilet and vanity areas, this hotel went above and beyond our exectations. Â Our stay included breakfast with plenty of options including scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, crepes, fruit and pastry. Â There is a full-service spa and health club, complete with two indoor pools, one for laps and one for recreational swimming, as well as a jacuzzi. Â We found the pools and gym areas to be perfect for the serious gym rat, but not as inviting to guests like us simply seeking a relaxing spot for a swim or preferring to soak in the sunshine. Â The rooftop bar was a nice place to relax with a nightcap with scenic views of city. Â We were even lucky enough to witness fireworks off in the distance. Â One suggestion I would make relating to the rooftop bar, however, is to perhaps prohibit young children in the evenings, to afford a more quiet and relaxing environment for the adults. Â We were looking for a nice quiet place for a nightcap, but found the noise from little kids running around the room to be disruptive. Â Otherwise, Hotel Porto Palacio is a high quality hotel, perfect for business people as well as tourists, and I would not hesitate to return.",Jan,2025,Jan 2025,2025-01-01,2025,4

Casa de Sezim,Gruntchuck,33,Gruntchuckwrote a review Nov 2015,"We stayed at Casa de Sezim for 4 nights in early September 2015. We had stayed in a couple of Paradors in Spain, but this was something else - a property that has been in the one family for over 700 years, with a working winery/vineyard. The host, Jose, and his team make you feel very welcome.After checking in, we started with a complimentary bottle of the Sezim Vinho Verde and some nibbles on the patio overlooking the valley. Had an excellent dinner in the dining room that night.Breakfasts each day freshly prepared and served in the dining room, including fresh juice, coffee, bacon and eggs to order, cereal and fruit. A self-service bar operates on an honour basis, and we did enjoy some more of the Sezim wine during our stay.Our room was large and included a separate sitting room. The furniture is old but comfortable, and integrates completely with the surroundings. Wifi was very good. Plenty of parking for your car.Couple of things to be aware of though:1. You really do need a car here as Sezim is not within walking distance of the attractions of Guimaraes OR be prepared to use taxis. The road into town is narrow and not suited to safe passage by pedestrians.2. Older folk may have issues climbing into/out of the shower - which is in a raised bath. We didn't have any issues, but some older couples did mention that to us.3. Pre-book your dinner if you want to eat in the dining room. The meals are good and good value, but are provided only for those who book. However, you can always order some sandwiches, salads and the like, which we did on our last night.4. The accommodation is part of the original manor, so it is old, the floorboards do creak and noise does travel through the walls. it is not air-conditioned. But this is all part of the experience and it is a beautiful and historic manor.Jose will recommend restaurants and attractions, and if you are lucky, will show you the winery - we had an enjoyable tour of the winery just as the harvest was underway.We can't recommend Casa de Sezim too highly and would definitely stay here again if we were in the area. It was one of the highlights of our travels through Spain, Portugal and Italy.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4

Pestana Bahia Praia,davidgriffiths,92,davidgriffithswrote a review Sep 2018,"Excellent location, spacious room. No other positives, sadly.Check in as follows: arrive 1.20pm and told that room will be available at 2. No offer of a drink, no other guests visible, receptionist took no phone calls (we sat about ten metres away) and at 2.15 returned to ask about room to be told it was now available. We asked why we had to wait almost an hour when clearly nothing happened in the interim. No explanation other than check in is at 2pm. Pointed out we were hot and had just arrived following a long journey and were advised that we could have gone to the restaurant to buy a drink if we were thirsty. Not a promising start.No water in the room, minibar empty, safe did not work so back to reception. Apparently most guests like to buy their own drinks to stock the minibar and there is a daily rental charge for the safe.Went to the gym: no water or cleaning materials (we were getting used to the place by now) so back to buy a bottle of water but the bar/restaurant was closed.Breakfast adequate but coffee was instant (an espresso being Nescafe with less water) and fruit juice listed as 65 per cent water. We decided to forego it after the first day.We did not eat there and were out from morning to late evening so can't comment on the other facilities.My wife summed it up on the second day (we were there for five) by saying \"do you think there are any corners this hotel doesn't cut?\". We spent the next few days at boutique hotel in Furnas which, despite having the same star rating, was in a different league in every respect.This place could be very good (and I understand some of the favourable reviews as the location and rooms are lovely) but they clearly economise on every little thing; and it shows.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,2

We stayed at the Clarion Suites.There are many good points about the Clarion Suites.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  It has a pool (which wasn't open during our stay although the temperatures were 70 degrees +).  The location is pretty good - just out of the centre in a quiet street ; travelling anywhere was fairly cheap and quick by either metro or taxi.  There are a few food restaurants within 15 minutes walk.  It is close to a lovely park and several cafes.On the negative side, the rooms look very tired and are in need of redecoration.  We had 3 TVs in our penthouse - not one of them was tuned properly !

Onyria Quinta da Marinha Hotel,David M,16,David Mwrote a review Jan 2024,"I had the pleasure of spending the first day and night of the new year at Onyria, and it was the highlight of my one-week trip to Portugal. The entire staff was so welcoming and genuinely pleasant and helpful, but I have to single out Rodrigo, who made sure that I had the golf experience of a lifetime. I had a perfect view of the course and a stunning sunset from my balcony, as do all of the second floor rooms. The course itself has solid tests for a beginner like me (such as the in-your-face obstacles on holes 5 and 14), and challenging holes for more experienced players (such as the long, snaking fairways on holes 6 and 10.) But what makes this course really special is the 13th through 16th holes, which have views of the Atlantic Ocean.  Golf lovers will appreciate what it's like to hit a ball against that breathtaking backdrop.  I would highly recommend Onyria for golf vacationers -  there are several other courses in the area, and the hotel also offers a free shuttle to the pictureqsue coastal town of Cascais.

Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,taddyoggy,3,taddyoggywrote a review Jun 2019,"When we arrived at these apartments we were met by our landlords and given a very friendly welcome.... Dieter (apologies if I have spelt that wrong) showed us into the apartment and we were immediately blown away by the size, even though we know Portugese apartments are always large.  The main living area had a huge L-shaped leather sofa, a dining table and chairs, a large dresser and a sideboard - but - what 'wowed' us more was when Dieter took us out onto the balcony - for balcony read : massive 30 x 15 foot terrace overlooking the pool area.  This had 2 sun loungers with their own parasol, a large table and four chairs with a second parasol and a clothes drying area.  It could have accommodated even more sun loungers, if needed.  It was huge!!  There is a very well-equipped kitchen - with everything that you would need to self-cater. The bathroom was also massive, with a seperate shower and bath, toilet, bidet and basin.  We could have had a party in there, it was so big.  The pool area was lovely and quiet.  For the week we were there (May) there was only ever one other couple sitting by the pool and, after they went home after a few days, we had the pool to ourselves for much of the day.  Bliss!!Dieter gave us a couple of 'money-off' cards for a couple of the restaurants nearby, which was appreciated and came to say a very heartfelt and sincere goodbye to us on our last day.  How lovely!  Enjoy....!!",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,5
