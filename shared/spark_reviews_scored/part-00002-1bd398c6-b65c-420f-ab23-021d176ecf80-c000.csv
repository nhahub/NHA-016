Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Kintore Quine,1,Kintore Quinewrote a review Oct 2019,"We paid the 4/5 star (depending on site you use) all inclusive price for this hotel with great expectations. We were badly let down on a number of accounts:The first room we had was lovely apart from the fact that it overlooked the massive hotel airconditioning system which rattled away all night - not my idea of a great view. If you decide to go, don't let the hotel put you anywhere near room 126. They did however move us when we complained.The food: thought I was playing safe by booking a good hotel with food included as I was concerned when I booked about Brexit and what would happened to £/Euro - little did we know nothing would change . As it happens, the food was so bad (not even coming close to 3 star) we had to eat out a lot of the time or ended up avoiding the main dinning room and opting for pizza (which was OK but nowhere near expectations). Can really recommend the Market Restaurant in Albufeira (a 15 - 20 minute walk from hotel).Social spaces - avoided the evening entertainment as this was not in a bar area but rather in the dining room in rows of uncomfortable chairs. There was nowhere comfortable to sit outside on the ground floor so seemed like a very anti-social hotel. You could brave the rather gloomy rooftop bar but in late September 10 floors up, be prepared for high winds and the requirement to wrap up warm.Hadn't been to Portugal before and hotel and Albufeira were a great disappointment. If you want somewhere nice, would recommend Lagos (a bit of a journey but worth it), or Tavira.The indoor pool - be prepared to pay c. £13 each time you use it.Overall, feel like we ended up doubling our spend outside of the hotel to make up for its shortcomings.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,3

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,vincent V,1,vincent Vwrote a review Apr 2024,"The hotel is very good, very clean. The restaurant offers varied menus and there is something for everyone. The room is very spacious and has everything you need!The big downside of this hotel lies in its clientele, very (too) Anglo-Saxon who respect nothing and no one. They push you around without even apologizing, pass you by at the buffet without queuing, in short, anything goes for these customers...The hotel does not make much effort for other guests, all the staff speak English. For the others, you will come back.I'm taking one star off for this point. It's a hotel for English people. If you are not bilingual, move on, even the animations are in English.",Apr,2024,Apr 2024,2024-04-01,2024,4
Villas Barrocal,Laurenlee2012,9,Laurenlee2012wrote a review Oct 2016,"We stayed here for a week and we had an amazing time. We arrived around 1am to find our keys and a map had been left in a safe place for us so no fuss checking, we were able to get our keys and head straight to our apartment, fantastic service. The two bedroom apartments are nice and big suitable for a family of four. The apartment was very clean and a mix of modern and traditional. The only down side inside is the beds are not very comfortable I have a bad back and did not find them comfy ( only reason this is not a 5 star review) you can see the springs through the sheets, the apartment next door was getting a refurb while we were here including new beds so maybe they will all be getting upgraded?. The pool area is great for kids and adults with two pools which again were kept to a very high standard. The pool bar serves great food and offers a take away service all very reasonably priced. We will 100% return",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Vickie❤,32,Vickie❤wrote a review Aug 2023,"We stayed here for the second time for a week in July and had a wonderful time!In fact we didn't want to go home.The hotel is beautiful and very clean and well thought out. Pool fantastic, amazing breakfast. The only reason we give it a 4 is because the first room we were allocated didn't meet our expectations as it was a solid balcony with no views  unlike the other rooms that have glass balconies over looking the amazing views. However, we were able to move rooms without a problem which really made the holiday.Staff are wonderful and incredibly helpful.Free shuttle into Carveiro centre which is only a 10 minute walk away anyway.We would return to this hotel time and again. Its one of our firm favourites.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Roger W,47,Roger Wwrote a review Aug 2015,Rooms very old and poorly appointed. View from balcony mainly aircon units !

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,TeamLorm,1,TeamLormwrote a review Jul 2024,"We've stayed here as a family 3 times now, and we all love it. We'll be heading back again.There's 4 of us so we get two adjoinining rooms. It is hard to book adjoining rooms on the website, we have to email them afterwards to ask, but it's never been a problem to sort it. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, although being critical you might say maybe a little tired in places given that it's a 5-star hotel. But the little touches like the bottled water every day make a real difference. When it's super hot in the middle of the day, we sometimes go back to the rooms to give the kids some shade - we do activities there, maybe sit on the balcony and watch the passing golfers.One criticism is that the air conditioning in the rooms is inconsistent. On several occasions we've had it where one room gets cool very easily, but the air con in the other room barely works. I'd be wary about going in the height of summer.I would say that we tend to stay in the nicer rooms, and having seen some of the more basic rooms I think we'd be significantly less comfortable in those - you probably wouldn't feel like you're in a 5-star hotel in those.The staff are attentive and our cleaner would always greet our kids with a big smile and a loud 'Ola!' every morning which was lovely. We even got a birthday cake this time around, as it was our son's 5th birthday during our stay. In the past we've gone over Easter and the kids have had little Easter baskets. Much appreciated.The breakfast is really well equipped with fresh fruit, juice, an omlette chef and everything else. The coffee isn't great, if I'm being harsh.We usually eat out in the resort, but when we do eat at the hotel the dinner is fabulous and the staff are so friendly. You are spoilt for choice in terms of good restaurants around here.This year was the first year where the pool was warm, in previous years it had't been heated and the water was super cold. It made a huge difference as we tend to visit in spring / early summer, we just didn't use the pool when the heating was broken. So it's nice to have a heated pool, but very annoying when you get there and find out the heating is broken. Hopefully it's all fixed now.The hotel and the resort is geared towards golfing (and tennis) possibly slightly more so than it is to families. So you tend to find a lot of golf tours in the morning at breakfast, and only a handful of families. But honestly I quite like this - it's nice going to a hotel that's not overrun with families (yes I know that we are one of those families, but you know what I mean) and there is still loads of things for kids our age (4-6) to do.Right next door is the Parc Tee where you have crazy golf, a play park, bouncy castles and football games. The resort's beach is a stone's throw away (our kids could easily spend all day there) and I already mentioned the heated pool. Everything we like doing is very close by... we didn't even get a hire car the first two times we went.Our kids LOVE going to kangaroo club - the kids club attached to the hotel that is free to guests. The lady that runs it is called Beatriz and the kids adore her. There are turtles (Nikita, Bing Bong), trampolines, bicycles, sand pits, football and lots of inside activities to give them some shade. If you want to you can lean over the side of the pool balcony to see what they're up to... or go and grab a cocktail and forget about them for a few hours - they're in very safe hands.Overall 5 stars from us - I think I'd like to see some investment in the rooms at some point to really justify the 5-star rating, but we've had some wonderful family memories here, and that's really all that matters.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,HeidiEnglandUk,94,HeidiEnglandUkwrote a review Jun 2025,Second visit - went June 2024 previously.  Four night break. This time had a junior suite and it was much upgraded from the 1 bed appt we had last time. No shower curtain this time but a shower screen. The decor in this room was much improved.Food is a bit hit and miss.  Odd combos at all mealtimes. We classed it as ‘fuel’ rather than food but we did always just about found something to eat that went together.  Have to say however bacon for breakfast was abysmal.  Soggy and undercooked and inedible mostlyPool area nice again. Quiet in the mornings. More groups of teens this year but they were very friendly and chatted with us oldies and weren’t overpowering with the teen antics.   Certainly didn’t spoil our holidayShame the pool bar doesn’t open even for a glass of water or a coffee before 11am.  Being down at the pool at 9am we were gasping for a glass water by 10am.Evening entertainment was ‘ok’. Karaoke night was embarrassing and they packed up early.  Should have realised early on that no one was interested …..  shame again you can’t take drinks to sit in the open area next door - the music was so loud that you couldn’t chat to othersStaff very friendly though. This is a major plus for the hotel and they should be congratulated on thatVisited the other hotels for drinks.  Good location and easy to walk to and from the old town and if heart attack hill as we called it was a bit steep one can take the land train for a few euros.Would we come again?  Probably but not for a few years to have a break and maybe the food improves and they take on board the pool bar evening hours request.,Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,3
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Lionheart,0,Lionheartwrote a review Jan 2019,"Today I was blown away by a tour guide at Lisbon Destination Hostel, Manuel, who took me and 2 other charming ladies to Sintra. The hostel itself is fantastic, and the best I’ve ever stayed in. Friendly guests and staff. The place is designed for you to be cheerful and happy, yet laid back. It is such a pleasure, especially Daniella who is so funny and kind!!Manuel took us to Sintra town and showed us the history and the place and explained so many details about this UNESCO sight. We also tried typical pasties and had lots of photo opportunities.Later we went to Quinta de Regaleria and I was blown away by it’s beauty!! So fun! Manuel provided us with a good bag lunch.There were many other photo ops and stops. We went to the West most point of the content and to a town on the beach as well. We also drove under the April 25 suspension bridge that is so famous and so many other things.Huge thank you to Manuel who was a pleasure, so chill and informative - a perfect guide!

We stayed one week, and its perfect place to relax, have full of silence, full of joy and sun holidays. Only thing - smoking, that unfortunately is allowed next to swimming pool. Hope next time wont be allowed any more. Food - we re vegan, a lot of options, fruits and vegetables plus - surprise seitan and pasta. A lot of cats that I loved and great yoga classes (with Isa, booked thanks to hotel). Perfect place to read, swim, travel, drink local vine and just relax. Madeira is just perfect place to relax, walk a lot (really a lot), and feel free. One of my favourite design hotel.",Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,5

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Lanzachick2015,15,Lanzachick2015wrote a review Jun 2015,"I have just come back from a 7 nights self catering holiday at forte do Vale hotel. Check in was smooth and greeted by an efficient receptionist. The room itself was very large and well proportioned. Split into a entrance sections with space for cases,Wardrobe with Safe (40 euro deposit) extra blankets and pillows plus torch. The bathroom shower over bath was clean and comfortable, my only complaint is that the shower curtain could do with replacing but that's me be pickie. The kitchen was well equipped with washing up liquid although small, washing machine, dishwasher and fridge/freezer. Plus all cutlery and crockery you could want to prepare a meal. The kitchen table sat four and the beds were very comfy. Our room had a balcony that over looked the roundabout but had a sea view and pool view. Due to he double glazing we never heard the roundabout once. The pool view was handy as the pool beds got busy very early. Lots of reserving with towels but also lots of people just wanting to get out early. The pool was cleaned everyday and the three different options meant that there was a pool for all ages. The location of the hotel is great between the strip and old town. Plus the local train stop outside the hotel made it easy to get about. About a 2 min walk is the local supermarket and a further 3 /5 min walk was a spar plus an amazing bakery and a few snack bars. If you are looking for a hotel that has it all then I would recommend this hotel.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,4

PortoBay Liberdade,johnjo163,1,johnjo163wrote a review Mar 2017,Light and airy reception with really helpful staff throughout the Hotel. Very comfortable and clean rooms and roof area with views over the surrounding buildings. Situated in a lovely tree lined road off of the Main Avenue into the town and tourist attractions it is ideally located within walking distance of the commercial and tourist areas. The Hotel facilities were excellent. We ate in the Restaurant one night and had a meal at the Aviator Bar another evening. Both were very good and good value for money. The assorted nuts accompanying drinks at the bare are plentiful.,Mar,2017,Mar 2017,2017-03-01,2017,5
Independente Principe Real,Jason D,13,Jason Dwrote a review Jun 2015,"This was the worst night's sleep I've had on this trip and this is no small feat considering I've been on overnight buses and trains in Turkey and Morocco on this trip. The hostel is located on a busy cobblestone road in an old district of Lisbon and at night the traffic seems to pick up even more. The sound of trucks and cars racing by a meter from the window rattling from the cobblestone all night made it nearly impossible to sleep. It was like sleeping under a metal bridge on a freeway, only worse. Oh, and the beds are triple bunk beds and they put three of us on one bunk even though there were only four people in the room with 3 triple bunk beds.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,1
Quinta do Furão,Midjan1,67,Midjan1wrote a review Oct 2017,"We stayed for 3 nights during our fortnight in Madeira and there is only positive things to say about this hotel. We had a lovely large room overlooking the gardens, mountains and most importantly the sea. To sit on the balcony and watch the sunrise, to listen to the waves and watch the beautiful ocean was really special.We ate in the restaurant each night and apart from the view, the food was amazing and the wine also great. The staff were friendly, especially in the restaurant and breakfast room. Breakfast was also excellent with great choices and ever helpful and alert staff.Would certainly recommend this hotel if you would like a bit of luxury and upgrade to the best room you can... it is not cheap.....but worth every penny",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,tony p,40,tony pwrote a review Dec 2016,"One of the most friendly hotels we have stayed in for many a while.Our visit was unplanned. We arrived along with a plane load of fellow travellers after our plane was diverted to Lisbon for an impromptu overnight stop. Not only did they cope with a large sudden influx of unexpected guests, but facilities were extended to ensure we had access to a late lunch.I've lost count of the number of times we have been approached by members of staff, making sure we had everything we needed. The way in which this has been done has always been perfectly natural, never forced or made to feel a matter of routine.We've already decided another year to make a planned return which just goes to show what attention to the customer can achieve for any hotelier. The ethos of this place is sound and customer led.",Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,5

Quinta do Mirante - ANC Resort,Robert O,0,Robert Owrote a review Jun 2016,"The hotel is nice and quiet. It is away from the Ponta Delgada but a short ride in a taxi. The small village of Agua de pau is a short walk up a hill. You can find some small markets to buy things for the room there. There is also some bars/café and restaurants there but I would have to travel to Ponta Delgada or go down to the marina restraint for a bigger meal. You can also order a breakfast that will be delivered to the room. It provided enough to get you going in the morning. It had coffee, tea, juice, eggs, 3 types of bread, yogurt, 3 types of fruit, and some slices of meat and cheese.The room was clean and nice. I had the multilevel duplex with a wonderful view of the ocean and hill side. We had to go to the lounge/ common area or reception area to receive internet though.The staff was wonderful and helpful with everything.They have two pools up on a ridge that  you can sun bath and enjoy the view of the blue Atlantic OceanIf you want a quiet and relaxing evening after your day of touring the island then you want to stay here.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4

( In fact one month later they are asking when they can come again !)This is not a flashy hotel and you won't find row upon row of sun-loungers laid outbut if you appreciate a little shade from palm trees and sheltered places to sunbathe and calm interiors this might be the place you are looking for.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,5
Royal Savoy Hotel,Michael H,29,Michael Hwrote a review Apr 2015,"My wife and I spent a week in the Royal Savoy, as we were invited by our friends to stay with them in their timeshare.  The first impression of the hotel was grandeur and luxury.We stayed on a corner apartment on the 5th floor (and you have to go down from the Reception Lobby to get there because the hotel was next to a cliff!)  The apartment had a en suite bedroom with a double sofa bed in the living room, which also had its own shower room.  There were a small well equipped kitchen and a generous dinning area, where we had a few dinners and playing many card games in the evenings.  We also had a huge south facing balcony over looking the Atlantic and this had made my holiday really memorable.The morning buffet breakfasts were full of choices, from the healthy to the full British.  We went for the fresh fruits, as they were exceptionally fresh with some of unusual varieties.  Eggs would be cook as required and again, they were really fresh.  The down side is that you may need to wait a little bit as the only chef behind the counter really takes care to do each order, but hey! who is in a hurry when on holiday in a place like Madeira anyway?!There were also indoor and outdoor pools, where I swam in.  They were really convenient for guests staying in the hotel and were quite well use.  I would like the water to be a bit cleaner, in particular the indoor pool, where most people swam when we were there.  Other facilities included a small but well-equipped gym, sauna and steamroom.  The hotel also had a different themed dinner and entertainment every night.  On level 1, there was a library and area with card tables for games etc.  no one was left with nothing to do during our stay there.So the facilities in the hotel was a big winners, but I did feel slightly let down by the services.  Don't get me wrong, the staff were friendly and polite, and they always greeted their guests with a smile.  What I think could be improved on in a hotel of such status are the domestic service.  My wife and I slept on the Living Room sofa bed and it was turned down for us not long after we arrived on the first day.  It would be good if the bed could be turned down later in the night so that we can still use the living room fully.  Furthermore, the sofa bed was not made into a sofa again on the couple of days and we had to ask for it to be done on the fourth day.  Our sofa bed also partly collapsed in the middle of one night.  Although it seemed to have been fixed the following night, maybe it is a sign that some furniture are needing an upgraded.All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and would be glad to return again sometime in the future.  From what our hosts told us, this hotel used to have some exceptional services now no longer available.  Maybe there have been some cut back but this is still a good place to stay, especially for the view of the Atlantic if not for anything else!",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4
Quinta do Mirante - ANC Resort,Julia S,1,Julia Swrote a review Jul 2018,"Had apartment that slept four, 2 downstairs and two upstairs in the loft.  Had a very nice patio with a view of the ocean that we loved sitting out on after dinner.  Pool overlooked the ocean and was never crowded.  Easy access to area beaches and beach side cafes.  The town center of Aqua de Pau was close and had restaurants, gas station and a grocery store with a few other shops.  After dinner one night we walked over to the local outdoor soccer field and watched a match-very fun and a lively local crowd.  The apartment itself had a well equipped kitchenette and was very quiet.  Staff at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.

But being a 4*, it is necessary to mention points that need to be reviewed urgently, namely the accesses: the ramp at the entrance has a slope outside the standards, certainly in addition to being very polished, as are the stairs, which are incomprehensible. The 3 places reserved for people with disticus were occupied by cars without disticus, being private the hotel has to take responsibility for preventing this from happening. In the same theme, access to the indoor pool requires a wheelchair to pass through the street and once inside the pool area, there is no wheelchair access to the pool entry area other than the loose entry bar. These are details, the hotel must be 30 or 40 years old perhaps, but 4* should have another meaning.",Dec,2023,Dec 2023,2023-12-01,2023,4
Cloud 9 Hostel,celi1782,26,celi1782wrote a review Jan 2012,"This hostel was hilarious. When we first got there we right away got to know that in Lagos everything is easy going. The location is great in the heart of town so you can easily walk to bars and restaurants. Not much more that beds in a room but it was clean. You have o make sure that when you do actually catch the daytime staff to ask any questions you might need because they sometimes are not there during the day. But not to worry because if you just ask around someone in the area knows where they are and will try and find them for you. There is no décor but the rooms were clean. To be honest you only spend your time in the hostel to sleep or clean up because there is much to do in Lagos. You can grab some sun on the beach or check out the grottos. And at night there is enough bars to keep you hopping from one place to another. So in all its cheap, clean and well located (a few steps from main strip for restaurants and bars). The only issue might be the noisy guests who talk outside the bar across from the hostel. Cool people just very noisy at night. And do try the food at café odeon…super cheap and good. Only thing is it’s super small so you either have to take it to go or cram in for a seat.",Jan,2012,Jan 2012,2012-01-01,2012,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,DanielK976,84,DanielK976wrote a review May 2017,"Warmly greeted on arrival by friendly professional staff to a beautifully and tastefully decorated reception area, the room on the 11th floor was impeccable with a glorious view of the sea...what a perfect start to a wonderful and memorable stay.One recurring theme in all my reviews for this site is the staff. For me, this is what makes or breaks any hotel. I have no reservation whatsoever in saying that the staff at the Crowne Plaza were superb in every way - friendly, courteous, professional.They made us feel so welcome upon arriving to checking out.There is two slight issues, not negatives, just issues, we found with the hotel. First of all there was no mirror in the room, you were literally surrounded by them in the bathroom but none in the room. Secondly, while spending a lot of time at the outdoor pool and most early evenings having a drink at the bar, we noticed the same CD being played over and over. by the end of the week we almost knew the set list, a disc shuffle would go a long way. As I said though, minor issues.The hotel is just a short stroll away from the Marina - the sea view way is a more scenic walk,  takes a little longer but worth doing even once - where you'll find a great choice of restaurants to cater for everyone's needs, prices from mid-range to expensive.Breakfast in the hotel offers a huge range from the typical fry to light buffets and all very tasty.A wonderful, relaxing stay and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.Huge thanks to all the staff, you are a credit to the hotel.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4

My wife is gluten free coeliac and she said it's the best food she's had in a hotel abroad. We were half board but as there wasn't many people eating on a night in the restaurant, it was a la carte and not buffet and I have to say it was fabulous.The pool is so nice, really long and great for doing lengths in.Kids pool is also great with pirate ship next to it which my daughter loved.The hotel seems very secure which is a big plus point having a 4 year old, fences all the way round the hotel.My daughter loved the kids club.My wife loved the cocktails.Breakfast was amazing with so much choice and good quality.It's our first time in this hotel and was recommended by my mother and father.We would definitely come back.Only one negative, big group of male golfers in the hotel and they were very loud.Apart from that all was excellent.",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,5

Also a barcardi and coke is €12.50.The rooms are really nice, cleaned on a daily basis. The room comes with an iron but it’s useless I might of well as used a brick.

The hotel and the rooms are very dated and a mix of furniture. Itâ€™s a very large complex and some room are far away from the restaurants and pool. Close to new town.Check in was a joke, not enough staff ones waiting ages and you canâ€™t check in to your room till 5pmYou have to put down â‚¬100 deposit for the room which wasnâ€™t mentioned and could be a problem for people.The food was a shock, itâ€™s very very basic and bland so was just ok. Drinks are ok too. The breakfast was good and by far the best meal of the day.The rooms a very noisy, lots of banging at all hours and above us were having a party till 5am. Lots of slamming door and gates to the grounds. Again rooms are big but dated and there are no mirrors other than the bathroomLots of walking to get around which might be hard for people.Overall this hotel is ok but not brilliant and I wouldnâ€™t recommend it or stay here again",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,3
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Stuart B,36,Stuart Bwrote a review May 2023,"The taxi driver told us the hotel had recently been upgraded, and you could tell most things were new, fresh paint, all very nice. Although away from the marina, it is only a ten minute walk, and only 20 minutes the other way to Quarteria which has lots of bars and restaurants.We have seen reviews saying the bar was very expensive, but found it no worse than nearby bars  and the staff were very attentive.Breakfast was very good for a buffet type breakfast so no complaints there either.If we had to pick faults, then firstly the room had no drawer space at all which is not that convenient, and secondly the balcony only has one chair on it, which is odd for a double room,. We asked at reception but were told that was the hotel rule and you could only have one chair. Very odd.",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,3
Quinta das Achadas,Sandra de Winter,19,Sandra de Winterwrote a review Aug 2023,"What a great place!!We stayed in the Jasmine apartment; a very spacious apartment, self-sufficient with kitchen, living room, two spacious bedrooms and two bathrooms. The rooms have been decorated with great care and love. Owner Jill showed me the other rooms; they are all spacious, delicious and beautiful!Cleaning lady Rosa comes every day and the towels are changed.The heated swimming pool, the beautiful garden, the play equipment for children, the football field, the two pigs, the two sweet house dogs Milo and Cassie, the jacuzzi, the BBQ's that you can use, the TV room outside, the kitchen inside, the communal dining area upstairs; everything that is there can be used.All cars can be parked on the site under a shelter against the sun.But this stay is mainly made by the owners Jill and Julio. They know all the names of the guests, give good and useful tips for trips in the area and set all the tables at the houses every morning for breakfast, which is neat and delicious. If you want, real English bacon and eggs will be made for you. During our stay they prepared an extensive and delicious meal twice for all guests. A wonderful and cozy get-together with good food and wine at the long dining table and separate table for the children upstairs. Great conversations and, above all, lots of humor.We have seen a lot of the area; from Odeceixe, Aljezur to Monchique, from Faro to Cabo de Sao Vicente, the beautiful West Coast, took surfing lessons on Amado beach, kayaked near Lagos (recommended) and slid down the slides in Aqualand (recommended with children)So this place is highly recommended; We were here for two weeks and had a wonderful time!",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,5

On welcome the concierge with light coloured hair was excellent on grabbing our bags and had great spoken English and conversational skills. The bed was huge and the rooms beautiful. Most nights you come back to find a lovely clean room and a chocolate on your pillow. One day unfortunately our room didn't get cleaned and we had to ask for clean towels. If you plan on having a romantic spa experience the steam rooms are gender separated and this was very disappointing.,Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,2
Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,TReis,2,TReiswrote a review Jun 2022,"We knew Altis BelÃ©m was one of the finest hotels in Lisbon. What we didnâ€™t know is that it is way better than what we see from the outside and what we expected from reading other reviews. The hotel seems very nice from the outside. In â€œthe first rowâ€ to the river, it has a small impact from the thousands of people that walk, cycle and do their jogging. Inside you will find a fine piece of architecture, nice lobby and great bars and restaurant (one of the best in Lisbon). The SPA is also incredible and our room was breathtaking!!! Wow! You are right on top of the river. Speaking of top, thereâ€™s this incredible rooftop with a very nice pool, not big but big enough to cool from the very hot temperature and also to swim a bit. If you want to swim, the SPA is the place to be. A very nice swimming pool, with some relaxing cascades and all the facilities to be one of the best SPAâ€™s Iâ€™ve ever been. Last but not the least, the service! All the staff was incredible but I need to highlight Teresa Dâ€™Orey and Nuno Soeiro. They were there for us all the time! Loved all the experience and will come back for sure!",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,5
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,920georgef,13,920georgefwrote a review Dec 2005,"I stayed here in late Nov-05. Granted this was off-season, but the room rate of â‚¬35 per night was a terrific deal. The hotel is of a good standard and deserves it rating. Facilities are good & the breakfast buffet is good given that it was included in the â‚¬35 nightly rate.The rooms can be a bit noisy [I found I could hear quite a bit of noise from neighouring rooms] but otherwise fine and there was no exterior noise from traffic/ parties as has been described by other reviewers.The only other downside is the location of the hotel which is mediocre (on the outskirts of the town and beside a petrol station/ vacant lot). I would say that hiring a car is essential if you want to stay here. Parking within the hotels' underground car park is extra, but at â‚¬25 per week this is good value.That said, it is a great place from which to explore the Algarve or to stay if on a golf trip. I would recommend it, especially if you get a good deal on room rates, and mainly want to use the hotel as a base.",Dec,2005,Dec 2005,2005-12-01,2005,4
