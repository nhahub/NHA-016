Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Clemo242,15,Clemo242wrote a review Aug 2023,"We just got back from a week here with a 14 year old daughter and 11 year old son.We had a very positive stay, not without negatives as with most things but a very well ran lovely hotel.There were no issues getting sunbeds, I’d even bought some lightweight travel ones in anticipation but it was not an issue. The flumes were great, enough even for our adrenaline loving teen. There were plenty of daytime activities, a shame our 14 and 11 year old couldn’t join in the stuff we did like darts etc as was minimum age 15 and they were not interested in a teens club. But there was lots to do and whilst there were rep exercises and routine, there wasn’t that annoying repeated theme song of the holiday type thing pounding multiple times per day that you get in some places.The staff were fab. Hard working, constant removing used cups and plates in restaurant and bar etc. there was never a long wait at any of the bars and decent brand drinks.The food was fine. Not as plentiful in choice as appears as there are duplicates stations. But plenty of salads and desserts and them themes each night for mains. Sometimes some was like warm especially eggs and beans at breakfast, which is strange as was so busy they must have been constantly replenishing. We could even get Prosecco/cava at breakfast! As we were there a week we got 2 free vouchers for the other restaurants. We left it too late so onlyManaged to get in the Brazilian on our last night but wow it was worth it. Intimate, lovely decor and good service and loads of meat for our carnivorous family!The entertainment was not for us. In a kind of marquee and way too cheesy for us and our older kids, definitely aimed at younger. The main bar was reallyJust a lounge/lobby near reception which was fine but could have done with some atmosphere. Why there was the odd live performer in a tiny tent round the back of the pool where no one knew there was seating, I don’t know. It’s very windy at night and you wouldn’t want to sit outside. Would’ve been lovely to have had that kind of entertainment or light ambience in the lobby lounge.Family room was disappointing. It was a normal room with a sofa bed. Noisy and cramped and I’d say not appropriate for 2 adults and 14 and 11 year old girl and boy.  That is my only real criticism.I used the gym and it’s well equipped although no air con and one treadmill only worked. The lifts were useful so I don’t know why people are reviewing that badly. Put in your floor and it tells you which lift to get. Saves people stopping on every single floor, we were on the top floor, number 10 of 10 so were grateful for this!Overall a great hotel, lovely weather, nos mosquitoes which was such a relief when myself and the kids get eaten alive usually, and a great location away from the tacky strip and walkingDistance if you’re up for it, to the town and beach but a free shuttle if not. We would go back although would get 2 rooms I think.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4
Hotel Madeira,Danielhe,39,Danielhewrote a review Oct 2006,"Closest hotel to the centre of Funchal - everything is within walking distance (most hotels are set miles to the West of Funchal). Moden, very clean but above all one of the most helpful hotels I have ever stayed in. No request was too much trouble and the staff all genuinely care about the guests enjoyment - there's plenty of 5* hotels that could learn from this hidden gemDanielLondon",Oct,2006,Oct 2006,2006-10-01,2006,5

Maria Mar - Surf & Guest House,Yildau,0,Yildauwrote a review Sep 2015,"This hostel felt like home from the first moment. The guest house is cozy, there is a big garden (fruittrees! swing! hammock!) and there are many places to sit down and enjoy the silence, the atmosphere and the view on the fields. It's highly recommended to visit this place by car, so you can easily discover the area and go to the beach.Best thing about this place though, more then the hostel itself, are the people. A warm family, friendly, open, and always willing to make your visit as good as possible. Maria Mar is absolutely worth a visit!",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,5

Vila Gale Collection Braga,World Traveller,316,World Travellerwrote a review Mar 2022,"Rude and arrogant staff at check-in (the two guys are sitting, but they are not offering seats to guests at check-in. It's more like checking in to a prison), rooms are extremely dark, insufficient lights, small windows (and stupidly with dark interiors). Atmosphere at breakfast like a canteen, staff not really friendly. Quality of food at breakfast is okay, but very very limited choice. Definitely not to recommend.THE HOTEL HAS A SEVERE HYGIENE ISSUE:The slippers in the room are not changed (I went to the reception when I saw the used slippers in my room and they confirmed: yes, they are reused without getting cleaned, meaning you are wearing slippers other people used before. That's a disgrace, disgusting and unhygienic.My shower was dirty, covered by black mold everywhere. I went to the reception to let them know, luckily at least they tried to clean afterwards (unfortunately not successfully, because the mould obviously has been there for ages already).And imagine: even the amenities in my room have also been already used.When I went to the reception to complain about the problems in my room the guy showed me by his face expression that he doesn't care at all. There was no reaction from his side, just ignorance. I had to talk with someone from the management to get my room finally cleaned.I would never go there again. It's probably the most expensive hotel in Braga, but it's simply a tourist trap.",Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,1
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,KerrieAnne K,22,KerrieAnne Kwrote a review Apr 2025,"Having just returned from a stay I would say that we were disappointed with the hotel. This hot has many positives however it has negatives to go along with it.Positives. Hotel was absolutely spotlessly clean and all the communal and pool areas were very well maintained. Staff were all extremely welcoming and nothing too much trouble. It was serviced daily and maintained to a good standard. It's only a 5 minute walk to the start of the strip, which was quite convenient if you wanted to escape the hotel.Negatives. Having read many positive reviews about the food I must say I was very underwhelmed!Food was often lukewarm and like previous reviews mentioned, required the use of microwaves to get it hot. Maybe a contributing issue is that the main restaurant was open from breakfast till very late at night and a lot of the produce like meats and fish seemed to be cooked and then left stacked under hot lights for long periods of time. The pool snack bar opens 11am-6pm but only offers cold food like sandwiches and salads. The hot food snack bar next to the main buffet restaurant doesn’t open until 3.30pm but even when it did open none of the food was hot! This is so disappointing from a 5 star hotel! Due to this we decided to eat out for our meals most of our holiday! I was surprised to see the absence of any fresh cooked station, like an omelette station in a morning or BBQ in the evening, which I would expect to see in 5* accommodationI can't comment on the 2 onsite restaurants as we unfortunately didn’t use these!The entertainment tent is a silly set up, set up like a school assembly hall.The kids club kids over 3 aren’t allowed a parent to wait meaning my little girl didn’t want to stay on her own. There was no arcade or anything for the kids either. The indoor pool is part of the spa meaning you have to pay to use. This meant on the days the weather wasn’t great there was nothing to do apart from venture outside the hotel.The rooms were very clean but we felt they were a tad on the small side especially for families.This hotel has put me off staying 5 star again!",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,2
Saccharum,Raikeswood,55,Raikeswoodwrote a review Nov 2016,"The transfer from Funchal Airport to the Savoy Saccharum takes an hour.  The hotel is situated beside the ocean on the edge of the seaside resort of Calheta. High cliffs rise opposite the hotel which has been cleverly designed to provide ocean views from the balconies of all of the rooms that naturally face towards the cliffs.The local supermarket and a small number of shops are just a pleasant five minute walk away along the harbour front, which itself is worth visiting - at least four different businesses offer food and drink in the harbour complex. At their rear there are two other restaurants immediately beneath the cliffs and Calheta's second hotel is at the other side of the harbour facing the supermarket and shops.If you want a hotel out of the city, but which has nearly every modern facility then the Savoy Saccharum is well worth a visit. The entrance is roomy, kept beautifully clean and sits proudly facing towards the ocean. Inside the hotel is again spacious, cool and clean. Reception staff have a great range of languages and are smart, efficient and hospitable - couldn't fault them.Our room was on the sixth floor. As soon as we opened the door we loved the character of the room and the fact that it had a classy, modern appearance with a toilet and bidet, separate shower area and a sink/dressing area which opened into the bedroom. Our lovely balcony with table and two chairs was behind the glass patio doors that formed the room's exterior.The only disappointment was the terrible television reception. Although approx. 80 channels are theoretically available, frequently the signal failed and the picture froze - quite often for up to a minute or more. This makes it very hard to follow anything of interest be it the news, a film etc.A kettle, small fridge, plenty of wardrobe and drawer space, as well as a desk area, an easy chair, a hardback chair and a double bench were also available for our use. The room was spotlessly clean and remained so throughout, with the only disappointing service evident on the day our regular very kind female cleaner was replaced by a male (who forgot to leave soap, toilet rolls etc).Every effort is made in the main dining area to provide a variety of meals, both at breakfast and at night. A full range of continental offerings was provided every day, as was a choice of fried, scrambled, boiled eggs, with small sausages, bacon, tomato, mushrooms and beans. The bread offered by the hotel was always beautifully fresh - and very moorish!A lovely lady cooks omelettes and crepes to order every day - she works non stop, yet remains very graceful - you could say swan like. I never heard anyone complain about her crepes or omelettes and many of the same people came back day after day.In the evenings there are always at least two types of fish and two types of meat dishes - quite often three of each - to choose from. A chef is on station in the side (crepes) area at night cooking quick meals and always has chips on offer as well. Again a full array of cold meats, salads etc is also available and the sweets served each night are far too tempting and taste wonderful. The only downside of the evening meal was the fact that neither tea nor coffee is routinely dispensed.Generally the table service is very good. A number of members of staff are of a very high standard and could clearly get work at any good hotel they chose to apply for. Others struggle a little, but a good to high standard is maintained by the hotel's duty maitre d's who not only meet and greet guests, but also keep a wary eye on staff.For those wanting to eat a la carte and who are already paying for half board they can, providing they give at least 24 hours notice, opt to eat in the hotel's other restaurant where an allowance of 13 Euros will be given per guest towards the cost of their evening meal. I seem to recall that typically a main meal in this restaurant would be around 14 Euros, but you should check first.The hotel offers a number of bars, a choice of swimming pools and a gymnasium.Car hire can be arranged from the hotel or a few hundred yards along at the harbour. If you hire at the hotel you are able to park the hire vehicle in the hotel's crowded outdoor car park (6.50 Euros/night) or in the comfort of the underground garage (7.50 Euros/night). You can park out on the main road for nothing - dependent on times and parking restrictions, but our understanding was that only cars hired via the hotel would be allowed to park on the premises.There are probably cheaper car hire deals to be had in Funchal, but we liked the convenience of dealing with the Savoy's excellent reception staff and the lady from the Why Not car hire company who brought our vehicle to us.Madeira is a mountainous island with a number of challenging roads and tunnels. In some places the roads are narrow and hug cliff edges - those with a nervous disposition may be better considering a short break in Lincolnshire or the Vale of York!We were pleased that we had chosen the Savoy Saccharum, that we had travelled with Jet 2 (good outgoing and return flight times) and had spent a week on a very beautiful and fertile island.Once again we found the Portuguese people to be the most welcoming of hosts.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,4

Our flat was great with 50\" tellies in every room, a fully equipped kitchen with a dishwasher and a washing machine. Everywhere was spotlessly clean, and the staff were most pleasant. I read the reviews of a few people who ate at the hotel, but we did not do this, preferring to wander around the town and strip, sampling various foods available at a myriad of restaurants. The pool is pristine, complete with a bar, so you don't have to walk far for refreshments.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,5

Palacio Vila Flor,abacusman,218,abacusmanwrote a review Mar 2019,They say the most important part in any home/hotel is location and you can not fault this hotel for that. Close to the cathedral castle and centre of Alfama it’s also close to restaurants and the river.But.Breakfast is honestly the worst I have ever had in Portugal. Although the bread is good there is little other choice. A small plate of cheese and meat is begrudgingly handed out with 4 pats of butter and the look you get when you ask for more butter. I felt like Oliver! Please sir can I have some more.Room was compact and air conditioned but no TV or coffee making facilities.On suite was very compact. Luckily I had lost a bit of weight because of the lack of breakfast. Have I mentioned how bad the breakfast was! Go to the hotel Paris is Porto for a breakfast! And a half!Staff friendly apart from breakfast waitress.Nice courtyard to sit out in and breakfast terrace also good unlike the breakfast.No views from either but I would imagine they would be cool in the height of summer.It’s my last day in the hotel so I went round to the butchers yesterday evening to get some ham and salami to add to the morsal provided by the hotel. At lease I can make one decent breakfast.A,Mar,2019,Mar 2019,2019-03-01,2019,2

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",BlueSky411,62,BlueSky411wrote a review Sep 2018,"We came to Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites expecting a family friendly place. We expect kids and what kids do as neighbors. What made it a downer for us was the hotel's inability to do the small things to help. The doors close with a loud thud...and if your neighbor's kids are up at 7am.....or if they are up till late and running down the hall it would seem you have no doors at all. Again, this is the hotel's job to invest in. Small miss in a lovely environment – sure, but an important one if you came her to relax.The front desk staff are not well trained. We saw the difference having arrived here from Sheraton Lisboa where everyone was on the same page and the hand-offs were smooth. At Pine Cliffs one person tells us to go to the DJ show and the other person tells us there isn't one (or let me check and call you back....and then no call for 10-minutes....how long should it take?).My wife and I are both Platinum with Ambassador service. Our Ambassador told us breakfast is included in the room. When we checked in we were helped by two from desk team members. Katarina thought the breakfast is not included. And that she would check with her manager and let us know. For the \"Luxury Collection\" property, is it the training or the staff themselves? As team leaders and skill developers we often wonder about the source of incompetence. This needs to be looked at by Mr. Thomas Schoen, the GM if he truly wants to give his patrons the experience they are visiting for. We received an invite through the door to join him for welcome drinks on one of the weekdays, however, we had to be on the road by then. Had we stayed through it, we would have shared our notes with him in person.We had dinner at the Mare by the sea one of our nights. Bruno couldn't be more inviting, helpful, attentive and gets five stars from us. Now there is the kind of service and support everyone will appreciate. The food was so-so. And yet, we would say it was a fabulous experience. Great work Bruno.The beach:The Spa: it is inviting and we did go in. There were two couples ahead of us waiting to be checked in. The lady helping the couple ahead of us kept mentioning the price (“Euro 500 for two of you”) but not answering their questions in detail on what to expect. They walked out and we followed.P.S. We were finally able to figure out that the breakfast was included but there was a miscommunication there too. Overall, the experience wasn’t the Luxury Collection we were anticipating. The GM, Mr. Shoen, has a lot of work to do before Pine Cliffs will match what it claims to be. Look elsewhere until then.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,4

We were in Room 66 which was more of an apartment, we had our own terrace with table & chairs, coffee table & 2 x sunloungers - very private & had sun in afternoons.

Hotel even provides beach towels! Hotel in a good location from the old town square, approx 10min walk, BUT be warned, do not take high heels as walk is cobbly & steep. Also take a long sleeve top as evenings may be a bit chilly. There is a coffee shop opposite (Leo's) who does a lovely coffee & breakfast, there is also a lovely restaurant next door to the hotel which does a fantastic seafood pasta. Rooms have kettle, microwave, 2-ring hob & is well equipped with everything needed to cook including tea towels.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Michael O,54,Michael Owrote a review Aug 2018,"I am a Platinum Elite Level Marriot Customer and have therefore experienced Marriot Hotels all over the world. I can confirm without equivocation that this is the worst Marriot Hotel I have ever stayed in. From the check in process which included a longer than usual wait time even though we had checked in on the mobile app the day before and the hotel supposedly had a dedicated Elite Level Desk (which for some reason was used for everyone else. The check in staff didn't even bother to ask me if I was Elite Level before telling me to wait for another guest. Perhaps he assumed I could not be because I was of African descent!) to the air conditioners that made awful noises all through the day and night. A complaint about the long check in and lack of priority service was met with a bland and defensive response from the front desk manager. We asked for a connecting room as we had booked 2 rooms as we were travelling with our 3 children. This was not to be. We were given rooms though on the same floor but with the intercom in the other room not functioning until we begged for it to be fixed (after several visits down the hall). I had to go to the lobby at 3am to complain and what was worse, they already knew about the problem! The technician offered to switch off my air conditioning as a solution (which was obviously not acceptable in the Portuguese heat wave). It was our first visit to Lisbon and Portugal and this is not a place I would recommend for anyone for vacation or business. The hotel is in dire need of renovation and it is a shame that Marriot lends it's name to such a property. Never again.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,1
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,gregnjeanie,26,gregnjeaniewrote a review Mar 2006,"We stayed at the Marriott in Lisbon last week.  We really enjoyed it as we usually don't stay in such nice places.  The bed was really big.  We had an extra bed put in for our 2 children.  My parents treated us with their points for the room.  The taxi fares in Lisbon are so inexpensive! I couldn't believe it.  From downtown to our hotel it was barely 5 Euro! We did buy a pass for the metro but after seeing how cheap the taxi's are I think I would take a taxi to get around. Much faster and easier when travelling with a bigger group.Everyone was nice at the Marriott. Plus since we travelled with my parents we were able to use the Executive Lounge on the 17th floor.  They always had snacks and free internet and drinks.We did order room service one night for one of my sons.  The hamburger was 8 Euro but came with fries and it was a good hamburger.  Of course there was an extra fee of 2,50 for the service but that was okay.I would stay there again if I went back.",Mar,2006,Mar 2006,2006-03-01,2006,4

Its modern, comfortable, with a roof top bar and pleasant dining room . It lives up to its rating. However the staff are brilliant and they set the place apart from most others we have stayed at.

I understand there are cultural differences and COVID challenges, but a coffee and light breakfast should not take 1.5+ hours and six flag downs of a server (because otherwise you are completely ignored), EVERY DAY.  Throughout the hotel and room little petty things I would normally brush off just kept adding up.  The menus are almost identical at every restaurant on property, we deserted those pretty quickly in favor of several other fabulous restaurants within walking distance.  Beware the premium experience, almost none of the advertised amenities are actually available or worthwhile.

RECEPTION/CHECK-IN is excellent and deserves their 5 star reputation.I further expect a knowledgeable -helpful concierge- who assist with sightseeing suggestion, Dinner suggestion and reservations  off premise and other issue. I found this service lacking even as I added after gratuities. Even one gentleman  initially REFUSED assistance until .I commented that my mother had been there last year and raved about the place.Pool staff initially told us to \"do it our-self\" with the chairs and umbrella, 2 euros and insistence reluctantly changed his attitude.The staff in the breakfast room I will say was a EXCELLENT.I must say we tipped throughout Portugal and where in Lisbon and Porto SERVICE excitement to help foreigners (down to a public bus driver) and share their country was offered prior to gratuity, I found the certain individuals at the REID very very reluctant to do what I perceive was their JOB.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,2
Saccharum,BluBerrie,44,BluBerriewrote a review Mar 2017,"We were here for 5 nights in February on our first trip to Madeira and I am very pleased we decided to book this hotel. Its in a quiet location, ideal for the walking and relaxing we had planned. The hotel is dark with a sensual feel, and would say a sea view room is a must. I was interested to see what the bathroom situation would be like and would say I am glad I was with my husband rather than friends.We were half board and I enjoyed the breakfast and evening buffet, however from my experience of this calibre of hotel the food standard of some dishes was not great. The service in the restaurant was the best in the hotel, I felt the service in other areas of the hotel lacked the same authenticity. The housekeeping was another area that was great most of the time but questionable at other times. These were the niggles that led to 4 rather than five stars for this review, ultimately its a great hotel in a most beautiful location that I would recommend.I would also recommend a spa treatment (if that's your thing)  and making most of the use of the spa area for a few hours as its an amazing space but an extra cost without a treatment.Things I found useful - the hotel bus to Funchal, a supermarket a short walk away, just opposite the other savoy hotel (useful for getting our water), the sugar cane factory we found it on one of our walks, small but interesting. Flat shoes, most of the walking involved the steepest of hills in hot sunshine.",Mar,2017,Mar 2017,2017-03-01,2017,4

Polite staff at the front desk, also in the restaurant, the price was totally ok for that, the hotel offeres.But there is one little problem. The hotel is getting older and you can see it. You can hear the noise from the rooms around, especially by night, you hear the noise when neighbours shut their door, you hear the toilet flushing and the airconditioning is too loud. Perhaps in a different room it might be better .Summery: We lived in hotels that were much more expensive and there it was not more silence by night than it was here. We lived in this hotel surely for the 10th time and  may be, we will come back.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,3

Saccharum,Alexandra A,0,Alexandra Awrote a review May 2024,"This resort just doesn’t deliver. The staff are lovely and clearly trying very hard. However, there’s a lot of confusion amongst the team (for example, front desk said we didnt need a reservation for the one smart restaurant, then we rocked up and were summarily turned away). The service is painfully slow, which is charming in its way but wears thin after a while. The rooms are a bit of a shocker, with the toilet and shower out in the open, with only a bit of frosted glass around each leaving very little “to the imagination”. The website says there’s a shuttle to Funchal, but it only makes one round trip a day and we didn’t meet any other guests who were able to make it work for them. Taxis into the main town come to €120 round trip, so you’re a bit stranded here. It’s a good effort, but doesn’t add up in the end",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,2

It did get fixed and we left blind down rest of our stay.Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice.We did find soft drinks & alcohol very expensive in hotel couple of examples can of coke €3 but only €1 in most restaurants on marina, Somersby cider 1 pint €7 in hotel but down marina €3.50 - €4.50 tops.Breakfast staff & bar staff, door men and pool men very friendly, but found reception staff bar 1 lady  not so friendly or helpful, and maybe need to crack a smile. A few times we approached staff to ask about area and buses but ended up having to find out information ourselves, due to lack of information from staff and not very helpful. With no eye contact.This was commented to us by a few guests with same opinion.Location is lovely with lots of restaurants we stayed 11 nights and tried a different restaurant each night and never had a bad meal once.Would I stay here again? yes but would hope on my return reception staff could be a bit more happy give you eye contact and be a bit more helpful.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,4

Although we arrived much earlier than the standard check-in time, our rooms were ready which was a very good start.  A spacious room, well furnished and spotlessly clean. Beautiful bathroom. We asked the porter for some extra hangers and also cups and saucers with tea, coffee, milk.  These items were delivered straight away. Very comfy bed.The pool area and grounds are attractively furnished, comfortable and well kept with plenty of places to lounge around. Beach towels are plentiful and issued free on request from the front desk.Very pleasant, helpful staff.The restaurant is brilliant and has the most appetising buffet of any I have experienced. The staff are friendly and attentive.  At both breakfast and dinner there is a huge selection of hot and cold food, beautifully presented, fresh and delicious. At breakfast I particularly liked the freshly made omelettes available to order while you watch - very nice.  At dinner there are also freshly made pasta or rice dishes.White wine served well chilled and left on side in ice bucket.We were there on a half board basis and not once were we bored with the selection.A delightful place to stay and just a short walk from the marina where there are some lovely places to stop for a drink or snack and soak up the sunshine.All in all a very nice, relaxing holiday and we will definitely go back.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,5

We spoke to many residents and most return every year and not one had a bad word to say.We were delayed 48 hours and Thompson relocated us to one of their own, larger hotels in the New Town.

Breakfast was good lots of choice, can get very busy but staff always around.Good pool but not heated and it was freezing! Small but adequate gym.To access the beach you catch a ferry from the river â‚¬2 return per person, takes about 10 mins. The beach is lovely and large, sunlounget to rent â‚¬12 for 2 and a parasol.Bars and restaurants there as well.Well worth a visit to Barril beach we got a taxi there then walked across.Tavira is a beautiful town with old buildings and cobbled streets.

Greeted by Nick (later to discover he was our PT for our boot camp sessions), we were shown around and made to feel very welcome.Bura is located in a residential area in Lagos with a 15-20 minute walk to the nearest beach and about the same to the town centre; the townâ€™s supermarket is only a 5-10 minute walk (very handy!).We had a jam packed itinerary full of fun and laugher, met lots of lovely like-minded people and shared some great memories (laughs included!).Nick kicked off our boot camp in normal PT style in our roof top session â€“ it was awesome, he listened and took everyoneâ€™s ability into account and encouraged each of us to do a little better than we thought we could.  I loved our PT session on the beach â€“ It was a perfect location and Nick ensured an equal flexibility between fun and fitness.We hiked, shared local cheese and wine while watching the sunset, embraced surfing, we were coached to ensure we got the most from our day; we shared a picnic lunch and indulged in SUP Paddle boarding â€“ all very exciting activities bring with them individual challenges.  We were picked up and transported to each location, taking the hassle away from organising this for ourselves â€“ ideal.Our days were followed by relaxing evenings and candlelit yoga sessions with Miri, she was amazing, such a lovely soul, her energy oozed peace and tranquillity.Refuelling after our activity-filled days was so important and â€˜Team Buraâ€™ made sure we were well looked after, seriously amazing food, so yummy.Getting a good nightâ€™s sleep was also very important; the rooms were basic yet, welcoming, clean and comfortable.

With the number of tour buses that come in, the morning breakfast buffet was always crazy if you wanted to eat 7:00 a.m. to 8:00a.m.  Breakfast food was just okay. The bar prices were a bit high considering wine in Portugal is relatively cheap. Tomar is amazing and would definitely recommend this hotel.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,3
