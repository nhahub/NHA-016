Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,evitleavit2023,0,evitleavit2023wrote a review Oct 2023,"Ok for families, very busy, buffet was average. Location ok. Didn’t watch any entertainment shows. Just sat in bar. They had singers in bar in the evening. Maids didn’t replace toilet roll so we actually ran out. Not enough milk in room.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,3
Saccharum,Melissa M,10,Melissa Mwrote a review Aug 2015,"This hotel reminded me of one of those very well-presented dishes that, once you taste, there's no flavor and you wonder if it's only eatable through your eyesight. Beautifully conceived - its architecture and pool areas, common areas -, yet a lot more is needed if you intend an hotel to be a reference.Altough it's stylish and such, there is no functionality (I'll explain further in the following details):1) When we got there, the receptionists weren't nice or anything, just checked us in without even giving us any warning or a brief oral presentation of the hotel (as ALL of the hotels we've stayed in do). For instance, when we got to the lift with our luggage it wasn't going up though we had already pressed the floor...another client came in the elevator and only then we understood that you have to pass your room keycard on a sensor in order for the elevator to move. This, and other aspects of the hotel, were not transmitted prior.2) As soon as you get into the room, you're standing on the bathroom, this is not properly private if you have to answer the door as it happened with us. The toilet is a separate compartment , which is nice and handy, but the bathroom area is open, there's no door. For couples, showering may not be a problem, but if you're travelling with friends, colleagues or even family it can get awkward....It should be mentioned or at least pointed out that the hotel has couples as its target. When it comes to hygiene, privacy is recommendable. There's no bathroom fan...and now window in this area.3) The hotel interior was conceived by portuguese overrated interior designer Nini Andrade, who apparently not only doesn't know that some people like to shower and take care of their hygiene privately, but also fails to understand that good lightning is needed. Lights in the room are low (this can be an issue while shaving or doing your make-up), except for the ones next to the bed which are too strong on the eye....talk about finding a middle term. This is a huge interior design faux-pas.4) Morning breakfast is good, though not exceptional. There's no food identification, eg; you may have 5 different kinds of jam and not know which one is which.5) You can't get into the SPA and its pool area, unless you are a prestige client or you'll have to pay 20€ per person. Under-aged (16) are not allowed anyways.6) Staff weren't particularly nice or welcoming, except for the waiters in the pool areas. Maybe it's the sun and the view, I don't know.7) You don't have mobile connection inside your bedroom, only if your operator is portuguese telecommunications service MEO. If not (for instance, Vodafone), you'll have to go outside to make/answer a phone call or receive/send messages.There are, however, some good points to be fair:- Great pools and its relaxing view, with large areas for all clients, one if which is outside of the hotel on a small beach- The bedroom provides good amenities and a powerful hair dryer for the ladies, probably the best I've seen in any hotel- Beds are very comfy- Large and good-quality TV screen on each bedroom with alarm clock available- Outside bars with good range of products- The gym is nice, but the provided towels are the size of our face- You can walk around and eat well for a good price near the hotel, there's even a supermarket ('Pingo Doce')- Wi-fi is free and accessible in all hotel areas.To sum up: there's a lot more that builds up an hotel's prestige and reputation than architecture and design, excellence in its services and functionality are also needed...it's a nice stay but it could be a lot better or at least for what they're aiming for.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,3
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,fannyUk,33,fannyUkwrote a review May 2022,"We were lucky and had a lovely big room with a sea view for the 3 of us. We were all inclusive which meant plenty of free drinks, snacks, buffet, entertainment and kids club.Admittedly as it was the beginning of May the pools were on the chilly side so we spent more time lying in the sun. We tested out the slides (the 4yr old on our laps for the big ones) and they are fast!The 4yr old loved the kids club once we gave it a go and they had lots of different activities on each day to keep her entertained. They also organised kids things at 7pm as well.It's at the top of the hill from oura beach, away from the main strip which was prefect for us. There are a few restaurants near by so if you want a change of scenery you aren't having to traipse all the way down the hill.The front desk were very helpful in sorting out taxis for us when we needed them and they also have a free shuttle down to Albufeira Old Town.As others have said the the buffet food was a bit hit and miss. There was a kids buffet but full of generic kids fayre so we tried to encourage the 4yr old to pick something from the adult buffet. Some of it was really good, where it was clearly a localist dish, but other parts were bland.There were entertainments at 7am for kids like animal shows and some kids club events but as we were with a 4yr old we needed to get her fed and to bed which was a shame. It would have been nice if some of them had been at 6pm, before dinner started. There were also two cinema shows as well which did clash with the music coming from the bar below us but with the balcony window shut you couldn't hear them.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,ConnollyFamily,9,ConnollyFamilywrote a review Apr 2024,Unfortunately the weather was bad while we were here but the apartment was very comfortable. The steam room was not working during our visit so only the sauna was available and was crowded due to bad weather.

Montebelo Viseu Congress Hotel & Spa,Shankar V,77,Shankar Vwrote a review Sep 2017,"A big shoutout to the wonderful and friendly staff at Montebelo Viseu Congress. This was our first visit to Portugal itself, but right from the planning stage the hotel was very helpful in arranging for a pickup from Porto airport, giving us details about the weather etc.Sandra, Patricia, Hugo: Thank you guys for all your help.The stay was fantastic, the view was awesome and the food was divine. We were a big group attending a wedding and the hotel made us feel right at home. The bar area is beautiful, overlooking the scenic views Viseu has to offer. The rooms were decent sized and well maintained.Breakfast was elaborate and the staff very courteous as well. They were very patient with our demands for our toddler ( and him running riot around the restaurant!!)The city center is walkable if you are adventurous (weather permitting), else a cab is just a call away and takes about 5 minutes to reach the downtown area.If you are planning a trip to Viseu, i think it is a no brainer that this is one of the best places to stay. Even if you are planning to be in Porto, do plan a trip to Viseu, it is well worth the drive.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,5

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Travellingtwin,2,Travellingtwinwrote a review Sep 2023,"Now, I’m not usually one to write reviews - however, I felt compelled to write a review on here to perhaps help future holiday makers in their decisions on their next holiday. When booking this hotel, I read reviews on here and thought a couple of the negative ones were perhaps from typical moaning people, however I am easily pleased and wanted to give my honest view of this hotel.First off the positives:• the rooms are a fantastic size for a family of 4 with cots, prams, cases and everything else inbetween including a gigantic flamingo inflatable!•the hotel is clean and modern.•plenty sun beds, no need to get up super early unless you want to be right by the pool on the first row.•slides are great and our children loved these.Now unfortunately that’s where the positives start and end.Negatives:•WASPS - they are everywhere around the pool during the day! This is due to the cup disposal system, the bins are covered in wasps due to the sugary drinks. The wasps are pests and circulate your sun beds if you have drinks nearby. The hotel needs to do something to address this issue as we saw many guests being stung during our stay, including our children.•food is horrendous - the worst all inclusive food we have had, it is not 5* standard. I would say food is on par with 3* hotel standards. Variety is poor, with breakfast leftovers noticeable in both the lunch and dinner buffets. I would advise future holidaymakers to make use of their restaurant tokens - the Al a carte are lovely. We ended up eating out most nights, which is not something you expect when all inclusive! Also a side note - bring a chainsaw to eat the sandwiches from the snack bar near the slides, the bread is so hard and stale you could almost use the bread as a weapon. I threw some to one of the many seagulls and even that turned it’s nose up at it.• cocktails - these are postmix cocktails which are horrendously sweet and strong, when asking staff to make fresh cocktails you are met with a scowl and a no. There is also no waiter service in any of the bars, which is not what you would expect in a 5* resort. I found myself being stuck to drinking fizzy pop in the evenings as the drinks were foul. The only nice alcoholic drinks was the sangria.•staff - this is the most miserable looking staff I have ever come across in any resort we have stayed in. None of the staff say hello, good morning, goodbye - nothing. They just look at you and do not respond when you say hello or smile when entering the restaurant or ordering drinks at the bar.•entertainment - the entertainment team work tremendously hard and long hours and I admire them for that, however… the entertainment is poor and substandard for a 5* hotel. It seems very flat and is only aimed at very small children - older children and adults are easily bored. We made our own fun most evenings or went out as the tent of doom outside for entertainment was rubbish.•you have to pay for the trampoline and bouncy castle outside the entertainment tent. I found this insane considering the cost of the holiday!! I would’ve expected this to be included for the price we paid for this holiday.• pools - we saw the seagulls and birds swimming/bathing in the swimming pools during the early morning, I felt this was not particularly sanitary and that the hotel could do something to deter these birds from the pools. We also saw birds pooping in the pools when flying past (which I know cannot be helped, but it felt unclean). Also a child pooped in the baby pool and hotel just scooped out and used a water Hoover and reopened the pool straight away - I felt there should have been some time passing before hotel reopened pool to allow for it to be properly disinfected. Also the pools are FREEZING, so be prepared for this.•shuttle bus does not have a queuing system, so it is a free for all when the bus arrives. This is not fair on people who were waiting first and end up not getting a place on the bus due to people pushing in. I feel that the hotel should put a ticket system in place to prevent people pushing the queue to address this issue to prevent this.Overall, we did have a good holiday, but this was not down to the hotel. It was down to the surrounding areas, the fantasitic zoo marine park (which I would absolutely recommend!!), and the beautiful fisherman’s beach and old town. Without these, our holiday would not have been half as good.I would not return to this hotel. It advertises 5* hotel with 5* prices, when really what you get is 3* plus (low low 4* at a push) standards. It’s such a shame because this hotel has such amazing potential. If it improved the food and entertainment it could be much better.",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,ApNp8,79,ApNp8wrote a review Feb 2015,"The Belmar was a wonderful experience for my wife and I; we arrived after a long day of train trip from Lisbon and were greeted warmly by the hotel staff.  Our room was in the main complex with no view of the beach and no access to the pool (hence the advice below); but the room itself was well appointed.  It wasn't a hotel room at all, but an actual studio apartment (as advertised, but still surprising).  The kitchenette had everything you need for your stay, the wifi signal was good, and the shade controls at the bedside were a nice touch.  We chose the Belmar in part due to the gym and lap pool and were happy to exercise every day.  The gym is a good size, but could become crowded during high seasn (we went just before).The location was excellent, a 5 minute walk to Praia Porto do Mos and a few minute drive to the famous Praia Dona Ana.  Keep in mind that is is a $10-15 taxi to get to downtown Lagos to go out at night.  Being from NYC this seemed normal, but if you are used to driving this is something you should plan ahead for as it does add up over the course of a week.The staff was attentive and very helpful, even helping me retrieve a lost cellphone that i had left in a cab (huge thanks for that!)  The only negative was how loud the cleaning folks were; as our flat was the end of the hall it seemed they started there every morning and the banging was a bit harsh if you want to sleep in.  I'm sure the upper floors didn't have that issue.All told I would definitely reccomend the hotel for couples travelling alone, or with children, as well as for a more mature (late 20's to early 40's) crowd.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,4

The Boliqueime Inn Hotel,Rosie H,74,Rosie Hwrote a review May 2013,"Chose this place for an overnight driving the N125 to Lagos. Situated on the outskirts of town this looks every bit an English pub with attendant beer signs outside.  Other than that, there is no identifying sign. I parked at the health centre a few yards up the road but discovered ample, secure, parking via a steep twisty drive behind the Inn which has been the subject of extensive renovation and now boasts a pool.  All staff speak English (most are Brits) and couldn't be more friendly or helpful.Accessed via an extensive flight of shallow steps my room, overlooking the road, was airy and bright, with thin carpet on the floor (a luxury when getting out of bed in this part of the world!) and a small wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was spotless with older perfectly working fitments, a good shower and lots of hot water if you leave the tap to run a bit, but no hair dryer. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the bedding warm but felt like sleeping on a caravan bed.The bar caters extensively to British ex-pats with cheap drinks and very reasonably priced local wine.  There is a separate large dining room but the bar also has tables laid for meals.  A chalk board displays the menu, geared to British tastes - it's not often you see liver & onions alongside sausage & mash but again, the meals are very reasonably priced.  Don't wait at table to be served, meals are ordered at the bar.  Everything is freshly cooked so expect a delay but the food is worth waiting for.  My steak and chips was served on an attractive wooden platter with a small side salad and grain mustard.  The chips were golden brown, cooked to perfection!  Breakfast (optional €3 continental) is exactly what you would expect staying in an English pub - generous portions of hot toast, home-made jam and marmalade, barista coffee or tea, plus reconstituted juice. There is a cooked breakfast option at a slightly higher cost, but still good value.There is live entertainment Wednesdays to Saturdays.For the price this is excellent budget accommodation that I would recommend.",May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Karan Khurana,0,Karan Khuranawrote a review Jul 2019,"Silver Elite member (almost gold. Check in not smooth.No clear Check in / Check Out Lane. Drainage issues. As a Silver Elite member, you have the option of getting services on a mobile check-in hence I requested for a Toothbrush / Shaving Kit after a long flight from Toronto. Of course not done. Keys didn't work twice, Upon the second issue with the keys, Andres Mendes at reception was terribly patronizing. For a customer service resolution when it's happened twice, the staff needs to be trained to move on and solve the issue immediately instead of suggesting all the different ways the customer could be at fault and refused to back down.  Same level of disgruntled service at the bar. Don't know if its a hotel specific issue but probably one of the worst Marriott services globally experienced.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,2

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",David H,0,David Hwrote a review Oct 17,"A really special hotel that we hope to revisit again soon. We stayed 8 days in October 2025From the moment you arrive the staff are all friendly and helpful . The pool team, doormen, cleaners, turn down are all fabulous staff.Every area of the hotel is nice, with seating areas to enjoy each vista this hotel has to offer -Our balcony was a perfect spot to watch the sunrise before heading for a long and leisurely breakfast. We were so lucky with our room - 840You can order eggs and other bespoke options - the fruit at breakfast is delightful.We ate at the italian - villa cipriani - it was a bit expensive, but a lovely experience - we did it twice - but there are equally good eateries in town.We also had the reids afternoon tea - we have a few whinges about this…Not everybody engaged with the dress code- we had people in t shirts, shorts and baseball hats ( american).I think reids need to say “ would sir like a jacket”’.!This behaviour by so many guests who were clearly not staying at the hotel dramatically cheapened the experience.But so did the upsell in the afternoon tea experience - “would sir like champagne?” “No… its ok… we dont drink” was my reply… “well if you change your mind” was the answer…At what point am i likely to suddenly take up alcohol!I think reids needs to prioritise those paying $1000 a night over those paying $100 for afternoon tea…. Or have a separate area for guests.We did the Reids garden tour with Grace - which was brilliant - very knowledgeableYou can borrow kayaks and SUP for free from the pool teamSwim in the sea, dive from the high board at low tide, but watch for the current if you arent used to sea swimming.All in all - one of the best hotels we have stayed in, and we are super grateful to the team for an incredible room allocation which really made our stay!",Oct,2025,Oct 2025,2025-10-01,2025,5

The only downside I could find is that because the windows were facing the inner courtyard, it didn't have much natural lighting, it was quite dark. Otherwise, everything was perfect! Even the fact that we had a terrace where one could smoke if they needed.Perfect location, the breakfast was amazing served on a terrace with an amazing ocean view.The infinity pool as well as all the areas to sunbathe was amazing.The hotel also featured a Solarium where one could go and enjoy a day at the ocean as well as drinks, which was virtually just across the street.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Andy C,15,Andy Cwrote a review Nov 2016,"We stayed for four nights to soak up a bit of sun before the onset of the English winter. We had previously enjoyed afternoon tea at Reids, whilst staying in Funchal, but decided to sample the hotel itself. On arrival we were greeted as if we were long lost friends and had been upgraded to a superior deluxe room with a view that encompassed Funchal harbour and Porto Santo in the distance. On the first evening we were invited to the manager's cocktail party, where we were treated to copious glasses of complimentary sparkling wine and numerous tasty canapés. Breakfast was served in the Garden Room, with views across the gardens, pool and out to sea. The buffet choice was excellent , with an option to order bepoke omelettes and poached eggs, eggs Benedict etc. The loungers were upholstered with luxurious cushioned mattresses. There were plenty of loungers around the two pools, and also on platforms that bordered the sea, access to which was via a lift or an energetic walk down stone steps, where there was also a small sea water pool. The decor evokes 1950's Black and White movies and you half expect to bump into Humphrey Bogart. The staff throughout, from the reception, to the restaurants, bar and pool, were all totally professional and nothing was too much trouble. The views from the cocktail bar at night are amazing. Stay here and you will not be disapointed !",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,janisScotland,62,janisScotlandwrote a review Aug 2016,Just back from a 7 night stay and I must say I was very impressed with this Hotel. 98% of the staff were polite and helpful. Rooms clean and modern. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Food very good both breakfast and evening dinner. The presentation of the food in the restaurant  in the evening was lovely. Only a couple of points stopped me giving this a 5 star rating. No seats in the grassed area. I like to read and find it uncomfortable to read lying on a sun bed. That said there was always plenty of sun beds available with accompanying umbrellas. The other point is I got bitten by a ant in the dinning room when I picked up a plate which was covered by ants on the underside! I did mention the ants to a waitress however she didn't seem interested. It was however the only occasion I came across ants. So perhaps a one off.,Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

They do not care , we have emailed Hugo the hotel general manager numerous times he has ignored us. Marcios the customer service manager has directed us to our travel agent.

Super location, helpful bar staff and amazing breakfasts.It is simply impossible to overlook the serious hygiene issues at the hotel at present. The pool area is being tortured by flocks of marauding seagulls - as a result the area is covered in bird faeces and pieces of raw fish which the birds fight over. Our balcony was also covered in bird droppings and was not cleaned effectively.I expressed my grave concerns officially on two occasions  and was promised that s manager would get back to me- they didn't!When I got home I emailed to express my concerns and received a brusque and flippant reply.We are so annoyed - we paid a great deal of money for our week's stay but we were not able to use the outdoor pool area at all.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,grumpyjim,0,grumpyjimwrote a review Jul 2009,"A spacious modern hotel but low-rise and designed to be in keeping with its surroundings. In a good location;  just  a short walk to the town and the ferry to the Ilha da Tavira. A reasonably sized, clean and well-serviced room. The buffet breakfast is exceptional.We have visited this hotel every year for the past six years and have always enjoyed our stay.  On our first visit, we found that standard rooms can suffer from traffic noise and barking dogs but that paying a little extra for an inside pool view room provided peace and tranquility - until this year that is!This year we found that the hotel provides regular, and noisy, 'entertainment' in the pool area at weekends and has a 'relaxed' attitude about noisy children. If you like being disturbed by people using microphones and by noisy 'music' (not of your choice) this will be fine. If, like us, you go on holiday for peaceful relaxation, it will not.Our advice would be that this hotel provides excellent value during the week but, even then, pick a  room away from the paddling pool. Ground floor rooms are preferable but not if a family chooses to engage  in some sort of ball game.A small niggle: if you need to use the internet to print a boarding pass, for example, don't expect to do it at the Vila Gale. The available computers do not have a printer facility, are not operated by Vila Gale and can be quite expensive.What a shame to have to write this review. It would be so simple for the Vila Gale to return to its previous standards of providing a base for the quiet and peaceful enjoyment  of Tavira to each and every one of its guests.",Jul,2009,Jul 2009,2009-07-01,2009,3

Hotel is located close to shops, bars and restaurants.3. Two good sized swimming pools ideal for young children.4. Rooms and surrounding areas cleaned daily to a good standard.5. Good evening entertainment and a huge bouncy castle to keep the younger ones happy.CONS1. Hotel is close to a club venue so often loud music right through the night.2. Worst sofa bed mattress ever. Mattress was extremely lumpy, uncomfortable and squeaky.3. Not enough sun loungers so prepare to wake up early to bag any.4. Minor gripe really- breakfast is always the same, no changes to the menu.5. Snacks such as ice cream and soft drinks too expensive, over 2 euros.6. In room WiFi access points provides a really poor connection.Overall my family and I had a pleasant enough stay. However, the hotel could do with making some improvements to the rooms and pool areas given the amount they charge, in my opinion to really qualify as a four star hotel.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,3
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,cornwall-blue,124,cornwall-bluewrote a review Apr 2022,"My wife and I have holidayed here on and off for over twenty years having previously had a timeshare at CPO. Our last visit was five years ago for the wedding of our youngest daughter. Wow, what a change in five years! CPO was a friendly family oriented place to relax and enjoy the stunning beaches and weather. However, the place is now plagued by stag and hen parties. Two examples - On our second day, approximately 25 drunk, loud and rude men sat around the main pool area - shouting, swearing and generally being a real pain in the bum. They were there most of the day. We left early on and returned later and they were still at it. There were  a number of hen parties too. Generally loud, drunk and without a care for anyone around them. On one occasion a rather large Irish woman was having  a shouting â€˜conversationâ€™ at a friend  approx 50 yards away. If she had bothered to move closer not only would it have been a lot quieter but she would also have lost some much needed pounds off her stomach!Sadly the resort of Praia da Oura has gone the same way. Every bar seemed to have a load of drunk blokes or screaming girls. On the beach, we had some respite but that was when it wasnâ€™t cloudy or raining.Oh and donâ€™t be fooled by the â€˜Deluxeâ€™ label attached to some apartments. Ours was ok and had most amenities but the â€˜deluxeâ€™ label means  you have a sea or pool view. We had neither really, being stuck in the far corner of the complex. A bit of pool was viable through trees and shrubs and the sea was hardly visible.We were so looking forward to our holiday after two lockdowns but we left disappointed - we shall not be going back.",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,2

We returned this year and booked 3 nights for the end of our 5 day walk.  There is virtually no English spoken in the small villages in the first stages of the walk. Miguel (our host in Casa da Tita, however, has excellent English and helped us with taxis, dinner, and information about the area.   We always intended to spend our time here relaxing by the pool so we did not go out and about much.  The rooms in Casa da Tita all have kitchens or access to one so we stocked up for the 3 nights.  There is also a barbecue for use by the guests.  Breakfast is by far the best we had the entire week and Miguel's mum and Dad are some of the friendliest people you could meet.

On leaving th3 coach we were told check in wasnt until 4pm but we got our room at 2pm after about a 45 min wait. We were in block F with a fantastic sea view & a large balcony. It was a bit of a trek to find the room and we did have to backtrack a few times (i was already prepared for this after reading previous reviews) air con in rooms was not working so a maid gave us a air con machine to plug in. Room was big and clean. Only complaint was in 6 days we didnt see a maid at all, only the day before we left when a maid asked if we wanted our room done which we declined due to leaving at 8 the next morning. Not sure if it was a covid thing or not as nothing explained at recpetion when booking in, but wasnt a massive deal to us. We did have to phone recpetion to ask for more toilet roll.We only ate breakfast once in the hotel and food was reasonable. We ate out for breakfast & evening meal. Lots of resturants within easy walking distance and not bad prices. 5 min walk from the strip.Just watch the paths can be slippy if wearing flip flops or sandels, same in the hotel.

Even nicer when you can call down and have a bottle of wine brought up to your deckchair :-)Cons: Spa massages weren't very wow for the 100+ euros sadly and wish I didnt spend money on that for what I received, despite the nice facilities and pool. Rooms did not get topped up with fresh still water each day to keep us hydrated, the tea and coffee was part of the mini bar and not a complimentary part of the room that most hotels offer.

The check in was quick and smooth, the reception desk agent Dora was thorough and efficient. We had been upgraded to a junior suite with a balcony that looked onto the pool area and the ocean. Quite a spacious room with a good sized bathroom. It had a run and a shower stall, as well as two sinks.The beds were comfortable. The curtains block out light well.There is a safe in the room, but you need to give deposit to get a pin and they charge 2 euros a day. Our room didn't have a refrigerator initially. Apparently it was being repaired. They did bring it back the second day and the front desk in the meantime stored stuff for us that needed the cold.Breakfast is a busy affair. Buffet with enough variety- eggs made to order by a lady in the breakfast area. She also makes crepes. Very sweet and friendly woman who I thought worked really hard with a full crowd.They also have local cheeses, cold cuts, fruits, yoghurt, breads, cakes.. None of these are worth writing home about..Good pool with a poolside bar. They give you a towel per day for free at the front desk with a coupon system.The main inside bar we found was often not staffed, perhaps the bartender has other duties as well.Room was cleaned daily. The bed was made and the toiletries filled.. However if you used the wine glasses in the room, they would be left unwashed exactly as you left them. Wasn't sure why this wasn't part of housekeeping.Grounds are kept neat and you can walk to the beach. Parking is in front and though there aren't enough marked spaces, there is a lot of unmarked space available as well.In all a great stay.
