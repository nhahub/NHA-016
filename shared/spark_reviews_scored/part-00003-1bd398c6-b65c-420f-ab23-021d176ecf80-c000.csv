Mayer Apartments,cindy s,1,cindy swrote a review Jul 2012,"we have just stayed here in a two bed apartment for a week and are now planning a return visit. Jan,Adrain and Laura were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them. The apartment was spacious,clean and well equipped with views out over the beach and sea. They are right next to the beach,cafe's and bars. There is also a lovely pool area which is perfect for everyone. we would highly recommend these apartments and we are looking forward to staying there again very soon.",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,5

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,mcallistermark,1,mcallistermarkwrote a review Jul 2023,We arrived with a young child (14 months) and had a great 5 night stay. The place is so clean and the service from the staff is fantastic.The all inclusive buffet option was great for the kids however it wouldn’t be restaurant quality but it’s definitely eatable.Great atmosphere about the hotel so would definitely return.,Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,3

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,dazpark8265,0,dazpark8265wrote a review May 2023,"Great resort, very close to the beach. We have stayed here many times and keep coming back for a reason.  Very quiet, spacious rooms.  The only thing that needs to be improved is the spa area. Without fail, nothing seems to work properly when we have been there.  Jacuzzi not very warm, jets are not working, dry sauna was out for half our stay. The towel situation needs to be resolved. They only give you one towel per person for the stay. These don't even fully cover a lounge chair and they will not give you another. On checkout, you had better make sure you brought your towels back to the spa to get your towel cards back or you will be charged. Not sure why the towels get treated like they are made out of gold.  We travel around the world and have never had a nice resort do similar. Other than that, everything was great and we will be back.",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Perret Jeremy,0,Perret Jeremywrote a review Aug 2025,"I currently reside at Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun and am extremely disappointed. The hotel is overcrowded, crowded everywhere, making the stay stressful instead of pleasant.Even with the “Plus” formula, which is very expensive, not all drinks are included and some are still extra, which is really abusive.The common areas are in an unacceptable state: extremely dirty and poorly maintained. The staff is unpleasant and the organization is catastrophic: we had booked a restaurant the day before, but the reservation was not even recorded, and we were simply told the same day that there was no reservation. As for the rooms, they are not made when we leave around 11am, and you have to call around 5pm to claim the cleaning, which is totally unacceptable for a so-called 5-star hotel.In short, I am in the middle of my stay and I already regret my choice: exorbitant price, questionable cleanliness, non-existent organization, unkind staff and services very far from promises. This hotel has 5 stars, but it definitely does not deserve them.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,2

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Arnold L,115,Arnold Lwrote a review Sep 2017,"This Hotel is situation about 15 minutes from the airport by cab, a 15 Euro ride and is located on the edge of the old Red Light district. Its about a 15 minute walk from here to the main harbour area and 20 minute walk to the bus station for all of the main tour busses. In our view quite central. You do have to walk through the China District to get into downtown but we were happy to do that. Staff are wonderful, helpful, happy to assist in any way possible. The rooms look out on either the avenue or the small piazza as the hotel is on a corner. we had a third floor room, quite small but quiet, away from the lift and not at all noisy. The view of the Avenue was really nothing to look at but this was a walking weekend to see the city and we found the room and hotel location to be fine. The hotel provides air conditioned rooms with coffee making facilities, lovely showers and super bedding and beds so we were very comfortable. We booked through Secret Escapes and were happy with the price which included breakfast and was about 120 pounds per night for the room and breakfast. Included is free wi fi and a smart phone with apps to get you around the city and 30 minutes free calling time on it. A really useful bit of equipment with google maps etc etc. so in my view a perfect get away hotel and we will definitely be back to stay. One other tip if you are staying longer than 3/4 days I think it would be worth paying for a larger room and give a bit more space as there is not a lot of hanging area in the smaller rooms. we loved it.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,LaurieH22,21,LaurieH22wrote a review May 2018,"We stay at 5 star hotels often, and the Valverde Hotel is no 5 star hotel.  We travel often, and I always try to write reviews about our best and worst experiences to help others.  This hotel is in my worst column.  Look at my other reviews, and you can see I almost never give one star.These are some of the reasons this hotel is closer to a 3 or 4 star hotel:1.	The “king bed” is two twin lumpy mattresses pushed together. Our nights were horrible, because the mattresses and pillows were so uncomfortable.2.	No door / privacy for the toilet, which means only one person at a time can use the entire bathroom.3.	No fan for the toilet.  So, you better hope you don’t get sick during your stay.4.	One tiny sink with limited counter space.5.	No gym / fitness center:  We’ve never stayed in a 5 star hotel without a fitness center; so, it didn’t seem important to check that they had a gym. What they do have is a tiny wading pool.6.	Tiny pool:  The pool is closer to a wading pond located right outside the restaurant.  It isn’t large enough for an adult to swim for fitness.  The pictures are deceptive.7.	One tiny elevator.  If it breaks during your stay, yikes.8.	Lack of toilet paper:  We almost ran out twice. We ran out of facial tissue once.9.	Lack of towels:  We were only given 2.  Most 5 stars will at least give you an addition 2 in case you need them.10.	Super expensive for the size and lack of typical amenities.I could go on listing other things, but I will spare you more details.  Some of these items alone would knock this off a 5 star experience; in combination, it just made us feel more and more robbed.We booked this hotel and paid a fortune to stay here, because it was listed as a 5 star hotel and the reviews were so good.  There a ton of other 5 star hotels nearby.  When we return to Lisbon, we will definitely be booking at a name brand hotel.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,1

Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,T S,19,T Swrote a review Aug 2013,"We had a flight delay so missed the last train to Pinhao, only getting as far as Regua and taking an expensive taxi ride to the quinta.  The hotel had been concerned for us, were very welcoming at such a late hour, and had been communicating with another vendor we had reservations with during the week.  The room was beautiful and comfortable with wonderful views to wake up to, the grounds are stunning!  What a wonderful way to start a trip.The next day we had a nice tour of the wine making process and had tastings.  The wine was good, another couple from Neatherlands made for delightful company and the hotel allowed us a late checkout and drove us to the train station in order for us to continue our trip.Thank you for starting our trip off on the right foot after it seemed like it was going to go bad.",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,4

PortoBay Liberdade,Joyce M,10,Joyce Mwrote a review Oct 2016,"Another wonderful stay in a Porto Bay hotel.  Due to the hot weather the hotel provided a haven from the city break activities we would normally undertake.  We ventured out each morning (chose coffee etc in establshment recommended by hotel) followed by city break tourist hotpots, followed by afternoon sun lounging on our spacious balcony.  Perfect combination of citybreak and sun vacation.  Staff at hotel were most welcoming and helpful, particularly in light on ongoing taxi strike.  Also lovely cake, champagne and message delivered from hotel staff to mark my birthday.  Spent a lovely day on rooftop bar, use of jacuzzi and personal service from staff member, including lunch, could not fault his service.  We checked out price to return again before we left, such was our exprience.  Will definitely return soon.  Dinner in restaurant was wonderful experience.

My teen daughter and I loved our stay at this hotel. The elevator is very convenient as we were on the top floor. If you also happen to stay on the top floor, just keep in mind that the windows leak a bit when it rains.  I really liked the small kitchen, everything we needed was there (coffee maker, fridge, kettle, etc.) Outside can get a bit noisy during the day and at night. It is a busy area so if you're looking for a quiet place to stay - this one is not for you. Loved the cleaning lady, she was wonderful and very helpful.  Front desk lady was a bit unfriendly at times.  It seemed like she didn't really like us.

Hotel Covilha Dona Maria Affiliated by Meliá,Sónia Melo Dias,84,Sónia Melo Diaswrote a review Jul 2015,"Have you ever felt that you have made the wrong choice when picking a hotel? We know exactly the feeling…This one was most definitely one of the worst ones and people who classified this hotel as a 4 star hotel should have their heads checked… By our standards it´s hardly a 3 star hotel…The only thing good about it it´s the location, anything else is a nightmare and it didn´t take us long to realize that.When we were checking in, the employee warned us that we had to come down for breakfast before 8 a.m., or else, we would have to face waiting in line for more than 20 minutes. That just didn´t make any sense to us, but the next day we understood what he meant: half of the restaurant was closed, so there weren´t enough tables for breakfast and guests had to wait for other guests to finish so they could come in and have their own breakfast. Even though there were empty tables, there were still people waiting to get in the restaurant. That is just awful service, isn´t it?But it doesn´t end here…Can you imagine a swimming pool with no loungers or any other equipment where you can relax by the pool? Neither can we, but there wasn´t any. We had to sit on the floor!!! No, I´m not done yet and the worst is yet to come… The swimming pool smelled of urine, it was impossible to be in there. I was utterly disgusted.We couldn´t sleep all night because of the noise in the hall outside the bedroom. Lots of families with children and obviously no education…Never again!",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,1

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Vee942,19,Vee942wrote a review Jul 2015,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for a week between 21st-28th June. We booked a Junior Suite with sea view, which is what we got.  The room was spotless with a great big bed, lush bathroom with a walk in shower, no bath.  The seating area had a couch, chairs & coffee table but no extra TV, which you sometimes get, which gives you and idea of the size of the room because although the room had a seating area it was only partioned off by a curtain, but essentially it was just one standard size room. The balcony was small and we didn't get the sun at all because it was covered ( room 530) and for some reason it only has one seat.  The coffee machine is easy to use to get hot water. When you arrive put the water in the back, switch on and leave on all the time which keeps the water hot ready for coffee or tea which is provided. Breakfast had plenty of choice but although busy it's easy to get around, however omelettes take time to cook so you may have a little wait and you have to ask for coffee and tea the staff don't ask you like most hotels. We didn't have any problem with the staff they always brought anything we asked for promptly.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the lobby bar were we got great service from the bar staff.  The bar had our special vodkas and gins that we like and the drinks were very professionally made.  The prices are equivalent to an up market hotel but we always got a plate of mixed nuts which we loved.  The bad points about this hotel have been noted a lot by previous guests.  The first being the sunbed problem, were you have to get up very early for the sun beds around the pool which have the padded mattresses, if you don't get one of them, from about 9am upwards you can put your towels on the grass verge and get a cheap plastic sunbed or a bean bag.  The issue is the people who put towels on the sun beds but don't come down to sunbathe until late morning and go away and come back.  The second issue is the prices at the pool bar, we found that one day it was one price, but for the same drinks the next day they were more expensive.  And the prices seem to be the same as the indoor bar which was obviously better quality, served to your table and also you are given snacks to go with them.  Not sure what's going on, my husband concluded the staff were being a bit sneaky but we only went twice so I'm not sure, although he did challenge the pool bar staff and they weren't able to produce a price list.  All in all we enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much, the bed was amazingly comfortable, the room was very quite and the location was great for the Marina.  We are definately going to stay at this hotel again in the future.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,4
Hotel Albergaria Dias,Deb095,10,Deb095wrote a review Sep 2010,"Just returned from a week at this hotel.  It is in a very peaceful location (not a slum area!).Everything is within easy walking distance (restaurants, shops, cablecar, marina).We chose the Albergaria Dias for a relaxing break, and that is what we got.  The hotel is clean and the staff very friendly, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, it was our fist visit to Madeira and we would definately stay here again.",Sep,2010,Sep 2010,2010-09-01,2010,2
Estalagem de MarvÃ£o - Casa de Campo,John R,38,John Rwrote a review Feb 2018,We made our first visit to Marvao on the 8 January we were booked into the Estalagem de Marvao. Prior to our arrival the hotel sent us a very helpful email covering a range of useful items including exactly how to get to the hotel once you are inside the walls of the village.The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was very good. There is an excellent restaurant two minutes walk from the hotel. The fortified village is on the top of a very high hill and is worth exploring. The views from the castle are outstanding.We will be returning on a future visit.,Feb,2018,Feb 2018,2018-02-01,2018,5

Hotel Albergaria Dias,AFC_Andy,19,AFC_Andywrote a review Jul 2011,"This is a massive TripAdvisor favourite - an award-winner in fact. Therefore we made sure to fit in a couple of nights there. However, we are left not entirely knowing what all the fuss was about. The service is entirely deserving of top marks - at the checkout and bar the staff could not be more friendly and helpful. The location is great too - very close to the old town and promenade and a world away from the isolated and drab area in which most of the big hotels reside.However, none of this changes the simple sad fact that the room is nowhere close to 4* (although ours had a great view). It was small, a little old-fashioned, with hard beds (twin when double had been requested), broken safe and air-con that can't be altered by occupants.So, to conclude - it's not a bland 3* rating. It's just that some things are great and others significantly less so!",Jul,2011,Jul 2011,2011-07-01,2011,3
Riversuites,Caroline171,108,Caroline171wrote a review Jun 2024,"The location is good; just across the river from Coimbra, so it was a short walk up the main street. The hotel rooms are in two side-by-side buildings filled with interior staircases and odd little spaces. Our room looked like (from the map on the door) it was one of the bigger ones, but it also has two Murphy beds beside the one double bed. The bathroom is small, and the sink is tiny with no stopper. And there’s really no place to put anything in the bathroom. I can’t imagine four people sharing that bathroom. Other people in our group complained about having small rooms, so there was clearly lots of variation. Everything was very clean and the staff were very nice. There is a small patio behind the basement-level breakfast room, but no one was using it during our stay.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,3
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Killamarshian,10,Killamarshianwrote a review Sep 2016,"We spent an enjoyable week at the Vila Gale Tavira. The room we had was cool in the daytime and was well fitted with a fridge, TV, bath and shower. There was always lots of hot water available instantly which is always a blessing in hot climates.The breakfast was excellent. All tastes were catered for, including English, a chef was available to cook your eggs and omelettes just how you desire. The drinks are on the expensive side but this is a hotel so par for the course. The bar meals were good value and available all day.The atmosphere around the pool was excellent, relaxed but not too quiet. The piped music did not intrude into the atmosphere. The staff were attentive and polite.The hotel is in a quite part of Tavira but only a few minutesâ€™ walk from the man area for restaurants.All in all, we had an excellent holiday. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would be happy to return.For the price we paid for the holiday it was excellent value.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

Hotel do Parque,nudgermanchester,93,nudgermanchesterwrote a review Jul 2014,"This hotel is in a very scenic and attractive location with some limited local facilities partly dedicated to religious themes but is a distance from central Barga. There are some empty and run down old hotels in the vicinity along with a convent and church accommodation The hotel has been newly refurbished in an interesting style that gives the impression that a talented interior designer has been given a free hand. We stayed for 4 days in a party of 22. Our room was small, quiet, very comfortable and tasteful. We had an adequate breakfast in a small dining room, the hotel bar was not really up and running, Dinner (so-so standard) was served in a near by co-owned hotel which provided spectacular views from the dining area. Nearby is a fairly basic terrace bar again with panoramic views were we had  pre and after dinner drinks. All the staff in every establishment were super and very anxious to help. This hotel and its staff deserve future success.",Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,4
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Hugo Rosado,23,Hugo Rosadowrote a review Aug 2017,"Rooms: Very good room, clean, a bit old style, I'm guessing it need a restyle in 5-10 years time. No problem with sound issues.Common areas: Wide main lobby, very quiet, it seems not to be a children hotel. Sometimes this is organic with hotel environment and this is not the case, which is good for me.Pool: One pool for kids and another for adults. Good area and a good place to relax.Food: Breakfast is ok, Typical choices, nothing extraordinary. Tried a Salad in the bar, not so good.Location: Very good location, walking distance from Tavira center.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Hotel Principe Lisboa,Heddastarbright,1,Heddastarbrightwrote a review Jan 2017,"We are a family of 4 so are somewhat limited in finding quad or family hotel rooms in the city. We needed to stay one night in Lisbon before flying home. This hotel was just a couple of subway stops from the sete rios train station where we arrived from the Agarve and right across the street from a subway station that took us easily to the airport the next morning. There are many restaurants in the area, the hotel staff was friendly and efficient, and the room itself was clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!",Jan,2017,Jan 2017,2017-01-01,2017,4
HF Fenix Lisboa,flipnEG,59,flipnEGwrote a review Mar 2019,"Centrally located and walking distance to museums, shopping, restaurants and sightseeing.Clean and modern furniture and comfortable bedding. However, rooms are somewhat compact or small...tight fit. Bathrooms are even more compact!  One person at a time!  Towel racks are located in the shower itself so you have to be very careful when turning on the water to the handheld shower head...it may be aimed at the towels!!!Electrical outlets are not conveniently located and could not be reached easily.  In our room, they were located just above the baseboards under the fixed night stands.  Required I get on my knees to try to plug in my electrical adapter and for my cellphone and iPad chargers.Buffet Breakfast is included with your stay.  Variety of foods and drinks (including sparking wine!!!).  However, the menu is the same every morning.No gym or swimming pool just outdoor garden and sitting area.",Mar,2019,Mar 2019,2019-03-01,2019,3
Myriad By Sana,Alin M,3,Alin Mwrote a review Jul 2019,"We were here for our honey moon and we stayed for 5 nights. We were offered complementary sparkling wine and chocolate dipped strawberries (excellent!). I liked everything about it: free wi-fi, very good selection of TV channels, the full mini bar (not cheap, but one would expect that), the service (everybody was nice, smiling and joking), the big room., the gym, spa and pool. And of course the view. While it is not in the center of Lisbon, we preferred the stunning view to the location. And it paid off for us, as we wanted to see the Oceanarium as well, the train station and airport were very close. We had one dinner at their restaurant. The food was exceptional, but I would have liked more choices. All in all, a wonderful experience, I recommend it.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4

Myriad By Sana,HuggieSRL,195,HuggieSRLwrote a review May 2016,"The hotel is really well appointed and has a feeling of luxury.  It might not be everyone's taste, but it has everything and everything works well.  We really enjoyed our two night stay.  The sun deck of the dining room is great place when the sun shines and the rooms are bright and modern.  The drawbacks of the hotel are (i) the service in the restaurant is bad for a top hotel, (ii) the toilet and bathroom are integrated into the rooms and this provides very little privacy for the toilet (a frosted glass door only) which is not ideal and (iii) the location is on the edge of Lisbon.  This is fine for the airport (10 minutes) and the MEO Arena (5 minutes walk) but not good for downtown. Having said all this I would definitely recommend this hotel if you don't need to be in the city center and I would go back if I had the opportunity",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4
White Exclusive Suites & Villas,Leslie W,0,Leslie Wwrote a review Sep 2022,"This is an extra special gem of a hotel. The thoughtful attention to every detail is matched by excellent service. Guests are greeted with a delicious welcome drink (we could hear the cocktail shaker as we arrived) and a lovely fruit and cheese platter brought to the room. The grounds are spacious for a small hotel, with multiple levels and spaces offering different vantage points of the spectacular ocean view. We enjoyed the fire pit for after dinner star gazing and plane spotting, and especially relished the outdoor dining area (never leaving that view!). Every item on the menu is top notch, including the made-to-order breakfasts from an à la carte menu. Many of the ingredients come from the owners' farm, so it everything is deliciously fresh. We will miss the Pico wines. We also appreciated the artisanship of the furnishings, including the ceramic bowls and pendant light fixtures, and delicate rattan chairs. In summary, this hotel is perfection and the perfect place to relax and recharge after exploring this amazing island. We highly recommend and would definitely return if we venture back to the Azores.",Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,5

Nice large rooms and great security with the drawer lockers and padlocks provided, think would have been good for a pub crawl but as we were there in the week nights it wasn't that busy. Enjoyed the room had its own bathroom and there were plenty more available close by. Staff were very friendly and helpful when it came to asking questions about how to get around the city, would definitely recommend this hostel.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,5

A little bit out of the real tourist area but close to metro and mini mercado. Maccas across the road if desperate. Kitchen was missing a few things but apart from that it was good. Iron and board available on request ad were other items. A bit dated but spacious.

Pestana Bahia Praia,Gerberra,26,Gerberrawrote a review Oct 2015,"Just come back from a week away staying at the Hotel Bahia Palace. Overall if you have booked here you will enjoy it. It is very central to the island - but you will need transport as about 25km outside of Ponta Delgada.  Although there is a pleasant walk into Vila Franca which we did on our first day and can highly recommend. The hotel is dated, but I understand is to be refurbished shortly. This did not spoil the holiday at all. Rooms were big and clean with stunning views over the Atlantic, and hopefully when refurbished they will keep as much of the wood within the hotel as possible.Staff were lovely and friendly and could not be more helpful, providing recommendations and booking taxis when needed.The hotel itself offers a shuttle bus into Ponta Delgada daily, which needs to be booked. It would be good if they offered to other places as well, and maybe an evening option so that restaurants in Ponta could be easily tried on an evening too.  For daytrips we used Greenzone Azores Jeep Trips which I can also recommend.The hotel food reminded me of trips to France / Spain in the late 70s / early 80s. Buffet breakfast was invariably cold. And I think (although could be wrong) the scrambled eggs were made from powdered eggs - consequently tried them once. Hopefully when refurbished they will have a cooking station, with someone cooking fresh eggs / omelettes / pancakes to order like in other European countries. It will taste better and be warm.  And the bread needs to be baked fresh not bought in.But considering the price paid, and everything else this is a small consideration.One final comment to the hotel (and to all tourist places in the Azores) - if you want to attract the British and American markets you need to stop the smoking in public places - e.g. restaurant / bar terraces. We all want to enjoy the outside when the weather allows, but smoking at tables when there is food is horrid and I know talking to other British and Americans on our trips we all found it very unpleasant and could stop us returning to the islands.",Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,3
Hotel Principe Lisboa,franklinduo,7,franklinduowrote a review Jun 2004,"We stayed at the Hotel Comfort Principe May 29th through June 1st.  Our first night in Lisbon was in a TINY hotel room, so we really appreciated the size of the Comfort Principe's room.  We even had a couch to relax on, as well as a balcony.  When we first arrived we were given a room on the second floor with a view of the roofs, so we asked to be moved.  They quickly showed us a room on the 6th floor (smoking room) to see if we liked it.  We loved it, and there was no odor of cigarettes at all.The room was clean and nicely decorated.  The bathroom was large and all tiled in marble. They were remodeling the check in area while we were there, but it did not interfere with our stay.  The breakfast room was large and the food adequate.The hotel is a short walk to the Metro station inside a large department store.  It was very convenient, there was a supermarket and food court right there.  I recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind using public transportation for a five minute ride to the downtown sections of Lisbon.",Jun,2004,Jun 2004,2004-06-01,2004,4
Myriad By Sana,Terence_Hill,121,Terence_Hillwrote a review Jun 2013,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during a business event. I had a room on the 4th floor with a great view to the river and the bridge. The room was very well equipped and comfortable with all you can expect for a 5 star hotel: minifridge (1 bottle of water for free), flat screen TV, AC, Wireless Internet, and the possibility to connect your IPod via Bluetooth to an audio system, however, I did not try it out. The window in the room can be opened only partially, but that’s not a big problem.The provided breakfast is great, as well as the view of the breakfast-area to the river.The hotel is located on a promenade that runs along the river, which makes it great for running.If you arrive in Lisbon via the airport, the hotel is located only 3 stops away at the station “Oriente”. If you take a taxi, it should be relatively cheap to get there. But the hotel is relatively new, so make sure the driver knows how to get there.Location wise, it is a bit far from downtown, but it is located next to a shopping mall. A taxi to downtown shouldn’t cost more than 10 Euro however. With the metro, it will be less than 2 Euro, but it will take longer, and, depending on your final destination, you might have to change to another line at least once.Overall, it is a great stay if you plan to relax only and if you don’t mind the taxi drive to downtown. If you want to experience Lisbon at best, I would suggest you stay as close to downtown as possible.",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,4

There is access to the kitchen which makes this very comfortable if you want to prepare some food. I wouldn't really count on breakfast, because it was made from the cheapest brand in Madeira. but the bread was lovely. I also think that lady that looks after the guests should be a bit more nicer, especially that she works in hospitality business, so you either like people or not.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4
