Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,michellehatton82,1,michellehatton82wrote a review May 2023,"We booked our stay at Jupiter directly with them, from our initial contact they were great.Upon arrival they gave us access to a dressing room to change, as our room wasn’t quiet ready - we did arrive around 11am but we did feel welcome.The hotel was fantastic for both couples and families. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable. We paid extra for the mini bar (€25) which a one off fee but was topped up every day with the things we had used.The main pool/slides area is perfect for families and provides plenty of activities for children of all ages (inc adults). The entertainment staff are very helpful and will keep the children entertained.We spent most of our time at the quieter pool and this was very nice.The restaurants and bars were great and the staff were very helpful/friendly.We would definitely return to this resort and would also recommend to anyone who wants a hotel in this area.",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Laura A,0,Laura Awrote a review Jul 2024,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. We have just returned from a truly amazing holiday. From the second we arrived the staff were amazing, the hotel is immaculate, food amazing, rooms big with lovely touches such as tent in the family rooms. Our children were ill on the first night (nothing to do with the hotel) and housekeeping couldn't do enough to help. We were given spare bedding and water without asking. The pools and flumes were more than enough to keep us entertained for a week. Tip for anyone travelling with dietary requirements - if you want dairy free ice cream or cheese/pizza go to the Pizzeria and ask for it. It took us a while to find out where to get it from. The food for the main buffet doesn't have food labels for each dish but if you ask at the restaurant reception they are more than willing to help.We had an amazing holiday and will be returning!",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,2

Hotel Madeira,Sunscreen30,29,Sunscreen30wrote a review Jul 2017,"This was my first time in Madeira. I would stay in an AirBnB the next time I come.Positives:-Close to the marina, shops and the promenade.-Comfortable room and a walkable hotel-close to shops and a grocery store (bottom floor of La Vie)-Quiet-Cute patio and great views. Their bottle of rose is cheap at their bar.Negatives:-You have to pay to use the in room safe-The breakfast and coffee is nothing to be desired. I went to get coffee afterwards. They also have a sign that says you can't take food out of the breakfast room or else you'll be charged.-The concierge didn't know about the bus system and couldn't answer touristy questions.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

Hotel Madeira,aacm87,47,aacm87wrote a review Sep 2022,"Can't fault this hotel for its location and staff both excellent. I would like to give special credit to the reception staff who were very kind, genuine people, and went the extra mile. There was a mix up with the room (a genuine mistake) which was quickly rectified and the lady on the reception couldn't have been more apologetic. The room was nice and spacious and air con worked well. Breakfast was fairly basic but understandable as they have limited space so a bigger spread wouldn't be practical. Overall a very good stay, in the heart of Funchal. Location couldn't be better. Finally a massive thank you to all the staff, you do a great job.",Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,5
Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,Samcath,58,Samcathwrote a review Apr 2017,"I stayed two nights in the Quinta in April and also had dinner there two consecutive nights.The Quinta is one located on top of a hill, roughly 25 minutes drive away from Pinhao. Given its location, you actually have no real choice for dinner but to have it at the Quinta (unless you feel like driving at night on narrow mountain winding  roads!) but this is okay because the restaurant is really nice and food is very tasty. Menu is a bit pricy (42 euros) but it is worth it. Wines are obviously Quinta's wines and very affordable. Waitress at the restaurant for dinner was very nice and extremely professional. Breakfast was good, fantastic juice, coffee not great but there is also a coffee machine, waiter was nice but a bit stressed and nervous when too many people arrived at the same time and had to re-fill the buffet but okay. Fresh products at breakfast, variety was okay but not so impressive. Bedroom was nice, bed mattresses and pillows are amazingly comfy, bathroom was good, there is air conditioning in the bedroom too. TV signal was not great but you don't go there to watch tv for hours. Wifi only in the common area, but that's okay.The property is quite big and there are walking trails too to visit vineyard. We had a tour and a tasting session with a guide who was really nice and very professional.One regret that I have however is on the consistency of the service and communication: this stay in the Douro was supposed to be the highlight of our trip across Portugal but when we arrived we were a bit disappointed as they're building a wine museum and there is a crane in the middle of the property and works going on that are quite noisy as you can imagine. I was told these works will be finished for this summer. The pool was also closed as they were refurbishing the pavement, which was also a pity since it was quite hot when we were there and we would have loved to use it, especially since it is a really nice pool overlooking the Douro. No big deal but I really regret not being informed upfront about these works and the inconvenience caused. How difficult was it to send an email to customers informing them about this? It costs nothing to do this. Are they afraid people will cancel? For a \"luxury\" establishment and given the price, it is really a fault in my opinion. Finally, all the staff we met were very friendly and professional in general. Staff at reception could have been more friendly and less cold...I even had to show the email they had sent to me to claim our tour and wine tasting as the man at reception wanted to charge us for this while the offer said it was included ! All quintas now charged tours and wine tasting, which I find a pity but charging your hotel guests for this is not the right thing to do in my opinion. We had our tour and tasting session organized as planned eventually...I hope the owners will take in consideration the above remarks if they want to maintain and improve their so-called \"luxury\" status as this is the kind of details that make your stay memorable or not. This is why I give it this average mark. If i had been informed about the works and if I did not have to claim what was included in the offer, I would have probably given a much better mark.",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,3
Hotel Madeira,AnnaGwen,129,AnnaGwenwrote a review Aug 2021,"We made a last minute booking for a fortnight in the Hotel Madeira and it was definitely a great choice. The hotel is in an excellent, central location - close to lots of good restaurants, the waterfront, lots of attractions like Blandy’s, the cable car and boat trips. Also 5 mins walk to bus stops taking you anywhere on the island and a taxi rank.The staff are friendly, especially Pedro, Miguel and Sonia. The breakfast is basic but fine, though coffee could be improved. The rooftop terrace is lovely, with a pool and bar. The bar re-opened on our second day there, but only in the afternoons which was a shame as the roof is a lovely place to enjoy an evening drink.The room was well equipped and very clean. Unusually for 3*, the shower was good and WiFi excellent. My only quibble was the balcony which was tiny with barely room for the two chairs and very enclosed by slatted windows, only one of which opened. Perhaps it’s a health & safety thing, but…. Luckily as we were on the 4th floor, it was only a few steps to the roof terrace.We normally stay in self-catering so it was new to spend so long in a hotel, but we didn’t regret it and would happily stay here again.",Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,3
PortoBay Serra Golf,Pavel P,13,Pavel Pwrote a review Jan 2019,"This was my best stay in Madeira, and maybe in all the Portugal. The bulging from 1920's still bears the unique spirit of those days. The domestic ambiance of the hotel is accomplished with pleasant things like indoor pool and sauna. The building surrounded with kinda small botanic garden. But, wherever you go or drive from it- you encounter picturesque landscapes of this still, remote place.Come here if you're after cooling down your brains, tight sleeping, and the fresh air, and don't move anywhere far for a couple of days. We enjoyed it to the fullest extent!Thank you PortoBay for hosting us!We'll be back sooner or later",Jan,2019,Jan 2019,2019-01-01,2019,5

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,AnIrishView,43,AnIrishViewwrote a review Aug 2019,"This hotel has a beautiful setting built into the cliffs of Ponto do Sol, with great views from all areas, the rooms, the pool and the restaurant. It has clearly been thoughtfully designed to fit into its surroundings and the simplicity of this design creates a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The breakfast is ok, the dinner was very good (though more expensive than other restaurants in the town - to be expected given the superior food & great views on offer). The hotel provide free return shuttles to the Levada walks each day which we found to be a huge bonus. Highly recommend this hotel.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,5
Hotel Madeira,Maurice A P,9,Maurice A Pwrote a review Jun 2018,"This is one of the worst hotels my wife and I have ever experienced and was so bad that we refused to eat breakfast after the first morning and abandoned the last night of our three night stay. When we arrived, we got no more than a glance from a very unpleasant and condescending receptionist who neither welcomed nor greeted us. Our room was little better than a jail cell, not least because of its cramped dimensions and its looking out onto an internal light well across from other guests passing corridor windows. To reach the room, we had to negotiate flights of stairs after leaving the lift. It took over an hour's persistence before we were moved to another room, which was better but nothing like the images on the hotel's web site. Breakfast the next morning was appalling. The canteen staff were rude and astonishing unhelpful and the choice of food was woeful. There was no proper coffee, which is inexcusable these days. A daily fee is levied to use the safe box in a room. The hotel bears little resemblance to its presentation on its web site, which is misleading in the extreme, and we would advise anyone asking us to avoid it. The cost of a room in this hotel are excessive compared to its lack of quality. There are far better hotels in Funchal that are pleasant to stay in and far better value than this one. Our access to the formal complaints book that all hotels must have on Madeira and that are regularly inspected by the authorities was denied.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,1

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Jackie S.,0,Jackie S.wrote a review Aug 2025,"Very disappointing stay. From check-in there was no welcome, only rude demands. Staff show no interest in guests — they just do the bare minimum, with no sense of hospitality. If you’re unlucky enough to stay in an end-of-corridor apartment, you’ll have to deal with maids resting all afternoon, speaking loudly, and laughing as if they were in a bar. Pool towels are a particular embarrassment: if you need a fresh one, you practically have to beg for it.The restaurant was also frustrating: although we were told it wasn’t necessary to book with half board, we were treated poorly when we didn’t reserve, even though we had already paid. They claimed there might not be enough food for us.Our advice: give proper professional training to your staff, or close the doors! The location is great, but that alone doesn’t make up for everything else.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,2

We made a reservation through our travel agent and ask for a suite with quite location in the hotel. When we arrived, we saw the constraction in front of the hotel, very noisy. When we got our suite we notised that all our windows facing the constraction and its very noisy in the room. We asked to change it to different suite but we was told that all the suites are on the same (2nd) floor and facing the constraction. I called our travel agent to complain and I was told that they are surprised also and nobody notify them about the constraction. We had to put up with noise all three days we stayed in the hotel. It was very annoying when you come to the room during the day to relax for a few hours and had to listen to all the constraction noises.Except that the hotel is nice and the personnel is friendly and proffesional.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,2

Comfortable beds and a powerful shower. The breakfast is fine, although the quality of the coffee and pastries could be higher given the star rating of the hotel. The staff are all very very helpful and friendly.We had room service and the food was also fairly low quality.I had family staying in another nearby hotel that cost less and had lovely amenities, so that may be worth considering.

Tivoli Kopke Porto Gaia Hotel,The_Dentist_7,28,The_Dentist_7wrote a review Aug 2025,"Amazing overall experience of this beautiful hotel, situated on the tip of Gaia with stunning panoramic views over the Rio Duoro. Walking in to the hustle and bustle of the touristy areas of Porto is approx 20 min walk (or approx €5 in a taxi).The hotel has a stunning spa, which my wife didn't hesitate to book treatments in (!!) and both outdoor and indoor swimming pools (the indoor needs to be booked to guarantee a slot which we liked as they only ever allowed 8 people to use maximum, and we often had the whole pool, steam room and sauna all to ourselves). The hotel breakfast I would give a 3 out of 5. I've had better and the service was super slow when waiting on drinks and menu ordered eggs. We only had the breakfast once but it's easy just to go out of breakfast or brunch.Immediately to the back of the hotel within a couple of minutes walk are markets, bars, and a lovely port cave tour. Access to the cable cars and the Jardim do Morro for stunning sunset views are within easy walking distance.In summary, as a family we do appreciate the finer things in life and I'd say this hotel is up there and would stay here again very happily when visiting beautiful Porto again!",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,4

Royal Savoy Hotel,hebridesferryman,80,hebridesferrymanwrote a review May 2015,"Back again for a week's visit at the end of April for the first time in 18 months, and pleased to see that standards are being maintained in all departments.We noted that the hotel corridors and public areas had been re-carpeted (excellent quality job), and that restaurant and poolside area menus were updated since our last visit too. Food and drink prices seemed more than reasonable when taking advantage of any of the available packages on offer.The pool and garden areas are in good order - lots of bedding plants in evidence in the flowered areas, but, as on our last few visits, we noted streaking and discolouration below many of the balconies, which is a pity and not in keeping with the rest of the hotel.Other than that, it's fair to say the Royal Savoy is deserving of it's 5 stars - the staff are all lovely, the ambience charming, and we will return soon no doubt.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4

The room cleaners were very good too.I will now list the negatives:There were no staff on the door greeting guests when arrived in their cars at certain times.The breakfast was  very dissapointing, the poached eggs were under cooked, no english tea.The outdoor pool is very cold.Not enough sunbeds  around the pool, had to go to the beach on two of the days as couldn’t get a sunbed. Expected the hotel to have sunbeds on part of the beach that we could use with the beach being so close but unfortunately not.  There were no private beds to hire either on the beach as they were all reserved, so had to lay on a towel on the sand (not what you expect when paying 5 star prices. The towel attendants very unhelpful. Getting a drink around the pool was near impossible unless you went to the bar yourself. Long wait to get any drinks or food in pool bar and outdoor bar area. All staff in hotel seemed miserable and unhelpful.Decided to visit the indoor spa area, jacuzzi closed and the indoor pool was freezing we left after 10mins. We asked if we could change our english money to euros in the hotel, was told no and no help trying to locate somewhere to change our money.In other hotels nothing is too much trouble, in this hotel you get the impression that everything is too much trouble.

Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,Helschip,33,Helschipwrote a review Nov 2018,"We stayed here for 9 nights in a suite. Staff is very welcoming and friendly. The suite was great, with a living room, a kitchen and a big bathroom. Hotel style is a modern: wood and concrete. During low season this gives the hotel a bit of a desolated feeling. On the other hand, it doesn’t overwhelm you and gives you a sense of being at peace in the middle of nowhere, which you are. Since you’re roughly in the middle of the island you can reach everything in 75 minutes maximum. Great location. We loved the ocean view as well. One of two five star hotels on the island. Highly recommended!",Nov,2018,Nov 2018,2018-11-01,2018,5

Hotel Gat Rossio,beautifulmatters,1337,beautifulmatterswrote a review Mar 2018,"I stayed here for 1 nights. I added one extra night in lisbon and I arrived late at night so I think to spend something cheaper just for a night.The room was small but with I payed for I think it was ok for europe. I got three windows there, so its quite a big room. However the shower is pack. But again its ok.Its a boutique budget hotel. They give you breakfast and I find it nice touch. I like orange and the sponge cake.Its not much to talk about, but It was ok. Near the train station and stores. And the staffs are nice and helpful. Very warm too. So I got nothing to complain about.What they can do better is to take out all the uneccesary nick nacks in the room and add a lil more water pressure in the shower.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,3

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Carole Z,1,Carole Zwrote a review Jan 2013,"We have stayed at the Vila Gale for the past five years for a week in March/ April and have never been disappointed. The staff from reception to cleaners are extremely helpful and friendly and ensure that your stay is a pleasurable one. I concede that some parts of the hotel's decor is beginning to look a little tired, but the cleanliness is beyond reproach. We always stay bed and breakfast and have found the selection and quality of the food to be superb. the only negative I would post is that the beds are a little on the hard side, but I understand that they have been refurbished lat year. We will be arriving on 11 th April for a week and as usual are really looking forward to our stay I the beautiful town of Tavira.",Jan,2013,Jan 2013,2013-01-01,2013,4
Luna Hotel Da Oura,Margaret H,11,Margaret Hwrote a review Jun 2017,"This is a pleasant hotel ideally situated with only a 5 minute walk to the strip, a 10 minute walk to the beach or 15 minute walk to the old town. Our room was spacious and well equipped for a self catering holiday, room was cleaned daily with towels changed. The type of guests that stayed here were mostly couples and European. The only down side of our stay was the hotel that is directly opposite and shared the pool, the guests that seem to occupy that hotel are mostly stag/hen party's and obviously can be quite loud especially between Thursday and Monday when they all seem to arrive, it's such a shame because it can put you off returning to our hotel.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4

Ok Reservation done!!! From the entrance a board with 3 regional and good quality cheese triangles and a splash of painful quality, I ordered a premium steak to my wife chocos, the follow-up was strictly the same for both dishes .... The steak  â‡  was very hard and tasteless the choco was not bad but the accompaniment of roasted potatoes and mango of chestnut and cabbage did not link with choco and tb bad with the steak.

Faro Airport is less than an hour. It's at the Western end of the Algarve, where the landscape is still green and unspoiled, the beaches golden and likewise unspoiled, the walks on cliffs and hills are fabulous, the towns and sights (castles, museums, churches) fascinating, and watch out for the storks and flamingoes.

Legendary Lisboa Suites,keenvisitor,210,keenvisitorwrote a review Aug 2010,"The cab driver had a hard time locating the hotel (I think he was new!) which is in a residential district close to Marques de Pombal Square.   The receprionist was very efficient and apologised for giving us a room other than the one we booked (for 1 night we just booked a standard double).   Not a problem as we were given the penthouse suite - 3 double bedrooms each with en-suite, powder room, hughe living/dining room, fully equipped eat-in kitchen and an enormous patio.  Very nice!   We walked to the center stopping for a snack on the way and returned on the metro - very easy.   On the way back we stopped in the grocery store and bought breakfast and supper items then stayed put enjoying our patio.   The pool was inviting and, since it was 40 degrees Hubby found it very refreshing.   Breakfast was not included in our rate si I cannot comment on it.We thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay and will return when we are next in Lisbon.   The quiet, comfort and pool make up for being a little out of town.  Of course we will probobly get a regular room next time although the penthouse would make sense if travelling with friends or family as each bedroom/bathroom was self contained.",Aug,2010,Aug 2010,2010-08-01,2010,4

It is convenient to go to the airport with only one line, no need to change train.  However you have to climb a lot of stairs to get out from the metro exit so you need to prepare if you have heavy luggages.  There is a big department store near the hotel.  There is also a clean and safe self service laundry service about 10 minutes walk from the hotel.  Breakfast at the hotel is excellent.  The staff at the breakfast room is also kind enough to let us eat breakfast early because we have an early flight to catch.  Room is clean and quiet.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,5

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Sam,1,Samwrote a review Jun 2025,"Just got back from a girls holiday, few positives of the hotel for us, the pool area was livley so good if thatâ€™s what your after and the Italian was lovely. However getting sun lounger if your not up early is basically impossible as all were reserved by 9:30am and no where near enough for the amount of people in the hotel.Our aircon wasnâ€™t working from the moment we got to our room, I asked reception to send maintenance and they did however it still didnâ€™t get fixed. This repeated 4 times and each time it did not get fixed. It was extremely hard to sleep in the heat and we could not open the windows due to the noise. On the last night we could not get ready due to the heat I went to reception who said yes we know the gas is broke so it canâ€™t be fixed. No one had told us this, I asked to move rooms and they said the hotel was full. They said they could send an air conditioning unit I said we need two as there were two bedrooms they only send one so we had to go to reception again. It was very tedious. The flush in both rooms was also broke and the rooms cleaned once during our 5 day stay and not really cleaned at all, we ran out of toilet roll and floors not cleaned. When we got to the room there was also things left from the people before us (dirty boxers being one).Okay if your just looking for a party holiday however we wanted to chill too, I also would have booked a different hotel if I knew we would have no air con for the whole time",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,1

Having never not gone when booked. When our flight to Porto was cancelled by Easyjet due to the Corvid-19 crisis we attempted to move this reservation to 2021. After a refusal via booking.com we attempted to contact the hotel direct. After Phoning the reception we obtained the E-mail address of the manager. Who after several attempts did not respond. I again phoned the hotel but the receptionist very politely informed us only the manager could do anything for us.  After a payment of 389 pounds the least he could do was to reply to us.
