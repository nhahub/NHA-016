Herdade Da Matinha,jorge,6,jorgewrote a review Sep 2020,This place looks like a hostel in the middle of nowhere with some containers pretending to be posh. No wifi or network connection and crazy expensive prices for a lousy accommodation. The place is ran by kids with no experience whatsoever. Looks lie they are on summer holidays. The place is dirty and was not well renovated with some weird paintings pretending to look like art. The food is a disaster. A guy cutting grass all day with terrible noise and kids in the pool with dippers shouting. Terrible experience. Place to avoid if you're looking to have some rest in a quality environment.,Sep,2020,Sep 2020,2020-09-01,2020,1
Quinta Mirabela,Paradise4831,12,Paradise4831wrote a review Nov 2005,"We (a couple) stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the end of October. Madeira was excellent, and we will definetly return there to see all the things we missed. The hotel though, will not be hearing or seeing any of us again so soon. I can't say that most of the staff was not helpfull and nice, because they were, but a 5 star hotel must pay attention to details in order to earn that classification, and that was not the case.In the bedroom there is no complimentary water to the guests, as happens in  most of the 5 star hotels in Portugal (continental) that I was used to; bathroom amenities are very poor; no bedroom slippers to match the bathrobes; no coffee and tea making facilities; no umbrella in the room (which would be quite handy for the sudden Madeira rain showers); Besides all this, we were supposed to have a fruit basket in the room on arrival, and that was simply \"forgotten\", as was my request to prepare the twin beds as a single bed (as there were no more king size bed rooms available).As I said before, by the second day of my stay I was already thinking that the hotel was not quite \"there\", but was willing to accept that they where probably still on the process of \"growing\" to become the quality hotel they claim to be.This totally changed the day before we left, and what happened then really made me forget any plans of ever coming back to this hotel. We had payed our stay, in full, one week before arriving, throuhg my homebanking service (the money was tranfered directly to the hotel's account), and the certificate of the payment was sent via fax o the hotel. The day before was left Madeira (10 days after the payment) we were asked, during breakfast, to present ourselves at the reception. We found this very odd and headed there right away, only to be informed that our money (that I knew was no longer in my account) had not yet reached the hotel's account. I was alarmed and immediatly asked if they had checked the certificate I sent, verifying if I had tranfered the money to the correct account. They said I had made no mistake, the account numver was right, but it simply was ot there yet, so they asked me very plitely if I did not mind to go to my bank agency in Funchal and check if there had been any problem tranfering the money.I did so immediatly, and honestly speaking, I was ready to make a complaint at the bank, because I was at this point, convinced that the money probably had been mistakingly placed at a different account that the one I ordered. To my surprise, when I got there they told me the money had already left their accounts, and had not been misplaced anywhere else. I went to another agency, this time a representative of the hotel's own bank, and they confirmed me thet the money was made available at the hotel's account 6 days before.So, as you can imagine, I lost an entire morning running around Funchal, only to discover that the hotel is not able to properly check their own bank account.This has never happened to me at ANY hotel, of ANY classification, let alone a 5 star. I find this unacceptable, and I am truly sorry that a hotel with such potential provides this kind of service.I hope this was an isolated case, because certainly if this happens to many guests they will end up with none, as I surely will never return to this facility ever again.",Nov,2005,Nov 2005,2005-11-01,2005,2

Saccharum,brankosabaric,7,brankosabaricwrote a review Feb 2017,"What an amazing hotel! We wanted to move from crowded streets of Funchal and headed for western part of Madeira. Even though the hotel was all that we wanted (indoor pool, great food, spacious rooms) it still managed to surprise us with little things. Helpful staff never failed to help or support us with our stay. And location is just perfect - just a minute away from a sandy beach and the same distance of hiking trails. While hidden from major roads. We would definitely consider it again!",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,James K,92,James Kwrote a review Jun 2015,"Just returned from a week in a 2 bed roof terrace apartment, huge space with great spec, air-con in all rooms, fully equipped kitchen that we actually used and even Skysports 1 to 5!Plenty of outdoor pool areas, great spa and just a short stroll to the brilliant beach.Food was good quality and value, even if a little short on choice.Only downside was the slightly remote location, however its a 6 euro taxi ride into Lagos Centro.Highly Recommended ....but worthwhile getting a car.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,3
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,nrewcastle,2,nrewcastlewrote a review Jun 2023,"Fine for basic family holiday for young children, but not at that price. Shouldn’t be 5*.Cold pools, bad food. Lift waits too long. Staff not friendly. Not good value for money overall.Kids club was fine, and it’s okay if you want to take young children for a loud, noisy, not relaxing holiday and just eat cold chips and nuggets.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,3
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Gillian,2,Gillianwrote a review Sep 2024,This hotel is in a stunning location. The view was the room was excellent.The service provided by the staff from check in to check out was second to none. The food at the Saturday night BBQ was fabulous.We had a deluxe room with sea view. The seaview was great. The room was a little smaller than expected but had excellent storage. It was a little tired in places but I am sure the hotel has a continuous program for re decoration and maintenance.

Artbeat Rooms,Ellie C,0,Ellie Cwrote a review Oct 2016,"All of the previous reviews have covered everything, but I loved my stay at Artbeat room so much that I had to comment too.Gosia & Gosia were lovely - friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. We arrived at 1am in the morning and they met us at the hostel no problem.We stayed in the Basquiat room and it really was beautiful. The only thing I'd say is that the street outside can be noisy, however I thought this added to the atmosphere and it's nothing a pair of earplugs can't solve.The location is amazing, right in the centre of Lisbon in a lovely area. Overall, Artbeat Rooms was a fabulous place to stay and great value and we will definitely return!",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,4
Hotel Madeira,Lauren S,0,Lauren Swrote a review Jul 2024,"Me and my friend booked this hotel as we just wanted a clean room to sleep in as we wouldn’t be in the room very often with doing activities most of the day, however we got much more! Very warm welcome as soon as we arrived at the hotel by receptionist who gave us all the information we needed. Hotel is in the centre of Funchal in a nice area, not loud at all for a good nights sleep and the balcony rooms have a shutter to stop light, not sure about the other rooms. The room was very clean with comfy beds and lots of storage space for clothes. Towels provided for sunbeds and bathroom. Bathroom decent size to put toiletries out on the side of the sink and in shower. The rooftop has great views of Funchal and good spot to sunbathe with a small pool. Also has a restaurant, which we only tried once but couldn’t fault from what we had. Many options for breakfast with hot food, pastries, cereals, fruit and more which was served from 7:30-10:30. Staff always topping up any food that had ran out straight away. Overall, a great place to stay with friendly staff and clean rooms.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,5
PortoBay Serra Golf,LondonMiked,7,LondonMikedwrote a review Apr 2013,"Serra Golf is, as the name suggests, close to one of the major golf courses in Madeira and it is obviously a great hotel for golfers but we found it an ideal spot for walkers. The village is over 600 meters above sea level on a volcanic plateau so there are walks close at hand either directly from the hotel or a short taxi ride away. The hotel keeps a file of suggested walks and walkers are generous in sharing their experiences.The Sera Golf is a small (22rooms) recently refurbished hotel with good well appointed rooms, a lounge and small indoor pool. We used the suite which opens directly onto the gaden but other rooms have small balconies for a quiet read after an active day. The garden is quite small but we found that this meant that guests talked to each other. This was also the case in the restaurant which was friendly, light and comfortable.The staff at Serra Golf were also friendly and helpful. Because the hotel is small they share the jobs that need to be done which means we felt we got to know them because they were serving at table, helping with directions, switching on the sauna, or booking a taxi or dealing with any problem.If you want a quiet hotel in the country in Madeira we recommend Serra Golf and if you must have the shops it is not that far to Funchal!",Apr,2013,Apr 2013,2013-04-01,2013,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Grace L,3,Grace Lwrote a review Sep 2015,"We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon to find our room wasn't ready. Hotel staff suggested we go to the pool - when we asked where we could get changed they told us there wasn't anywhere - how utterly ridiculous.We stayed in one of the older rooms which was adequate but we had paid slightly extra for a sea view - the view turned out to be a roof with air on units on with the sea in the very very far distance - upon approaching staff about this matter they told us they only had partial sea view rooms - this was at no point made clear during the booking process !!!!!!!The service round the pool was appalling, as was the cleanliness. When we went out for dinner on an evening the pool area was a disgrace empty bowls, plates, glasses and dirty towels were littered around the pool area.There was only one day during our week stay where we managed to get a sun lounger by the pool - many had towels on with no owner in site. The towel staff were also incredibly unhelpful.The pool had no room to swim in, as it was filled with inflatables, and screaming kids. On one occasion I moved numerous inflatables out the way to get into the pool when a staff member came and put them back in the pool so I couldn't get in.We spoke to staff about the disappointed with our stay and they didn't seem surprised.I certainly WILL NOT back - they are charging 5 star prices for what is a 2/3 star hotel.The only bright note was that there was a trainee member of staff - pedro. He was helpful and friendly and actually appeared to be doing some work unlike the majority of his colleagues.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,2

The bed was the most comfortable we selp in through out our tripStaff couldn't do enough to help you out. So friendly. Free drink at bar at arrival bathroom was gorgeous.

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Jennifer W,2,Jennifer Wwrote a review Nov 2022,"Staff was incredibly kind and helpful.   Almost every dish served was either without flavor or poorly made.  The soup was just spinach and water, served luke warm and the Cesar dressing was just mayonnaise as two examples.  Rooms were topically clean but very dark, beds were comfortable,  closet space was very awkward.  The lovely people working here made the stay nice but otherwise it was just average.

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,7will7,80,7will7wrote a review Mar 2015,A group of friends and I returned to see the hotel and eat in the restaurant after it had been refurbished.It is still very friendly but I did not like the decor.The bar has lost its cosy atmosphere. There are no longer littler alcoves to sit and chat with friends. No more sofas to sit on and have a pre dinner drink. It has a bright sparkly look about it but I prefer what was there before.The restaurant is still serving good quality food but I did not feel the service was as good a level as my previous visits. I think they had young waiters still learning their skills and were not yet up to speed.,Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,3

Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,OwenCC,3,OwenCCwrote a review Apr 2017,"This is a fantastic hotel in the most beautiful setting.We decided to treat ourselves by booking Quinta Nova for a one night stay during a week long road trip around northern Portugal and are really pleased we did.After checking in and being shown to our stunning room with a view (overlooking the gorgeous valley) we decided to attend the complimentary wine tour.  Our guide Sandra was great. We are both novice wine enthusiasts and Sandra provided the most informative and enjoyable tour from start to  finish. The wine tasting at the end isn't free but is well worth it (definitely get the cheese board as well).The attention to detail throughout the hotel is immaculate & the staff couldn't do anymore to assist but the real highlight is without doubt the views into the valley and  endless vines. Sitting outside with a bottle of wine surrounded by such beauty was breathtaking.Whilst the hotel did have some construction work being undertaken, it didn't interfere with our stay. The only small negative was that we weren't allowed to use the pool (we didn't know that it's not open all year round). Otherwise we couldn't recommend a stay at Quinta Nova any more.",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,4
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Cats41Nottingham,84,Cats41Nottinghamwrote a review Dec 2024,"We have just returned home from another wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel.  This was our third visit.  Our welcome was warm and friendly and we were shown to our room with views over the gardens to the harbour and sea.  Very comfortable with everything you would need for your stay.  The whole hotel is extremely relaxing with lots of lovely sitting areas, and a small boutique.  Outside are two pools and sitting area. All of the staff are most welcoming, efficient, helpful and friendly.  Breakfasts are fantastic to begin your day with an array of delicious fresh foods to choose from.  There is also a menu for other cooked items you may like.  Afternoon tea is a delight served on the balcony overlooking the gardens and the sea.  We booked dinner in the Italian restaurant a few steps from the main hotel but in the same grounds.  The food there is delicious. It is just a wonderful relaxing hotel to stay in while in Madeira.  We enjoyed every minute of it, and, all being well, we hope to return again in 2025.  Thank you very much to all the lovely staff. xx",Dec,2024,Dec 2024,2024-12-01,2024,5
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Richard S,44,Richard Swrote a review Mar 2018,"My son and I had been traveling in Portugal and wisely spent our final day at the Marriott.  It was close to the airport, had an excellent Executive Lounge, was very clean and the staff were excellent.  One of the door men helped us multiple times including an intervention with our cab driver to ensure we received the correct change.  On multiple occasions, he asked us how were doing and the other hotel staff were friendly and helpful as well. Our major regret is that we didn’t spend more time in Lisbon at the Marriott. Great stay.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,4
Porto Cinema Apartments,SFjoe,338,SFjoewrote a review Sep 2019,Pros:  In the heart of a busy street that does not allow cars and has many shops and restaurants close by.Newly remodeled apartment and everything is in working order and decent supplies in the small kitchen plus a microwave and dishwasher.Large LED TV with many English channels including The Family Guy which is great at 3am when I could not sleep.Small bedroom but ample light with the two large windows.Living room has two large windows as well.New bathroom so the plumbing worked well.Subway and train lines close by and within walking distance.No noise from the other apartments in the building and the AC unit worked well and was quiet.Cons: staff except the lovely maid who cleaned the apartment had zero customer service skills. We buzzed the intercom one hour before the 4pm check in time and were barked at to go away and that the apartment would not be available before 4pm.  Almost rude.There is a very long set of stairs to climb before you have access to the elevator so if you are carrying luggage get ready.The mattress was not big enough for two adult people even though it was advertised as a double.  One of us wound up on the couch so we could sleep without being on top of each other.   Also the mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable.  No extra blankets were provided just the one comforter for the bed.Because of the location and pedestrian walkway the noise from the street was a constant roar 7/24.   We closed the windows and metal shutters which helped but because it is a very old building the noise proofing is pretty poor.  So bring ear plugs if you hope to sleep.But what bothered us the most was the updated instruction email we received two days before our arrival was filled with warnings about the owners are not responsible for any thefts and that guests are required to protect their belongings and valuables in the safe.  We were instructed to lock all windows to the unit and the metal shutters when not there.  So clearly they had some level of break ins for the units. The safe was really small so I could not fit my iPad in it and had to carry it around during our stay.  The email made us wary of,Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

Breakfast was excellent. Great bed, lots of pillows. Fitness center and pool in the basement: Nice!We had breakfast in the room one morning, which the staff botched up. Food enough for at least 5 persons (we were only two) but no coffee. When the coffee finally arrived it was old and stale and undrinkable. The Nespresso machine in the room was okay, but why does a hotel in this price range charge 2,50 EUR pr capsule? Quite unnecessary and very irritating. We were there for five nights.

Hyatt Regency Lisbon,BMILLER,0,BMILLERwrote a review Jun 2023,"What can I say about the Hyatt Regency in Lisbon, Portugal, except that our stay there was excellent?  The staff was always available to take care of our needs, and their hospitality was exceptional.  This hotel is by far one of the best places we've stayed where the staff truly puts their customers first with their pleasant and professional care.  The restaurant staff and culinary delights were outstanding.  The GM of the restaurant/hotel was always there to accommodate our wishes.   Lastly, the Health SPA (Serenity) staff and their amenities were fabulous.  The staff at the Health SPA went way above and beyond our expectations to perform the \"Art of Wellbeing\"  for us after our daily tours.  Relaxing in their Thermal Oasis, getting massages, and receiving pedicures were exhilarating, to say the least.  So, if you plan a trip to Lisbon, Portugal, and you don't want to be in the hustle and bustle of the City and want to branch out to other areas Portugal has to offer, I highly recommend staying at the  Hyatt Regency.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,5

We were given a map of the city and the staff orientated us to the city and things to do and see. Our 5th floor room was a Jr. Suite which accommodated my family of 3 perfectly.  Hotel Valverde has top-notch service.  Late one evening as we were returning to the hotel after a long day of site seeing, my son and I were craving an original custard tart from Pasteis de Nata located in Belem.  These tarts are delicious, but it is a cab ride away.  Fernando greeted us at the door as we were returning and heard us talking about the tarts.  We went to the hotel bar for a glass of vino and shortly after Fernando walked in with three tarts!!  He went to Belem specifically for us!  Fernando also arranged a private site seeing tour for us of the Palaces.  The staff in the restaurant was equally as wonderful and attentive.

Villas D. Dinis Charming Residence Adults Only,Terri Parent,0,Terri Parentwrote a review Nov 2019,"We were excited about this place when we booked it, and it turned out to be better than expected! We stayed for 4 nights in late October (which was delightfully quiet and peaceful, yet with flowers still in bloom) in room #10 on the second floor, in the main villa property. First impressions: our room was beautiful and spacious. We were delighted by the tasteful decor, gorgeous wood furnishings, and balcony with a fantastic view, which made for a great place to enjoy the complimentary and nicely-chilled bottle of wine. Walking to and from our room was a delight in and of itself, with the property's meandering walking paths, pool/lounge areas, foliage, and singing birds. The breakfast was a great way to start the day, with plenty of local foods (and pastries, omg) and good coffee in a relaxing setting. Best of all, the location of this property was perfectly situated for us, as we planned to do a lot of walking and hiking around the area. We chose not to rent a car, which may not be the right call for some but worked out perfectly for us. As long as you're up for a decent amount of walking, you can get to a ton of beaches, trails, restaurants and the downtown area from this villa, and you can call an Uber anytime if needed. The streets around the villa aren't equally lit up at night, but it never felt unsafe to me. We absolutely loved this place and we would recommend it in a heartbeat -- and definitely plan to come back!",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,5
Saccharum,Walter K,4,Walter Kwrote a review Nov 2017,"It was a great disappointment that some hotels get away with murder.....calling itself a resort hotel, is a complete no go. I worked as executive Chef in Resorts of Hilton, Intercontinental and Sheraton hotels, this was a joke.Wikipadia resort: A resort (North American English) is an isolated place,self-contained commercial establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such as food, drink, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the premises. The term resort may be used for a hotel property that provides an array of amenities, typically including entertainment and recreational activities.This was a very dark place like you feel in the lobby, entering a morgue, dark and uninviting, the corridors to the rooms a so dark, you feel frustrated straight away. We booked a week via jet2holidays to get away from the grey days of UK. But on arrival of this so called 5star Savoy hotel in the middle of nowhere, 50 km away from Funchal, where the life of the capital should bei, there was a friendly staff member who checked us into our room, facing a wall, with no sumlight at all, my wife who booked our holiday started crying.....we went to reception to explain our concerns about the room, and after a while \"given that we are full, I have another option for you\" we had a long walk and made it to room 546 at the end of all corridors, we had a balcony and a side view to the sea. Thank you, we obviously agreed to the room with at least some natural sun light.The design leaves a lot to desire, given that your room has a hand wash basin at the entrance of the room, then a walk in shower with glass panels, frosted glass to the height of 4 foot without door, overlooking your wife or partner on the bed. Not any rooms are suitable for colleagues who do not want to share that views. No door available. The toilet room is further down with a sliding glass door again frosted glass to just 4 foot. with a toilet and opposite 3 meter away a Pidet.The only mirror for your wife to put some make up on is the one at the entrance about 70 cm away behind the sink. The sink is one of these new modern very shallow ones, every thing swims behind it after you washed your face.There is no entertainment what so ever in the hotel, no shops or anything else that reminds you on a a resort hotel. They paid more attention to the architect maintains his original idea of trying to maintain the charme of the old sugarcane mill, which doesn't mean that the paying customers are going to enjoy the comfort of the hotel. The rooms where serviced by around 5.30 pm given that this was for us the very first time in our 40 years of hospitality experience in resort and city hotels, that the rooms where serviced that late.Given that you are situated in the middle of no where, there is a daily bus service provided by the hotel for the amount of 20 euro per person to the capital of Funchal. This is needless to say found by most the customers a rip off. There a a marina with a few restaurants near the hotel and a supermarket to by some stuff you assumed is available at the resort shops.....sun lotion or any souvenirs or anything else.The restaurants: if I would have served the Luke warm food at any of our resort hotels I would have been fired. The breakfast selection was good nothing wrong with it, but given that in the EU we have certain health and safety standards, ( Madeira is part of Portugal, and therefor these rules should apply as to all European countries,) I am positive that a Nora virus is never far away from it.The swimming pools are beautiful with only one back draw none of the pools a more then 3.4 ft deep, which make swimming more difficult for tall people, the images of the hotel have been massaged to give a wow effect.If I want to have something about the history of the place I go to a museum or look at some pictures of the property.The reply comments to this will be a very typical Standart one, as to all other previous customers, \" we aim at the highest Standart and customer satisfaction and we feel sorry that we did not meet your requirement......this is just not good enaugh given that our holiday was not cheap. And be rest assured that many more customers will complain. The owning company will need to take serious action to fulfil future Savoy customers needs,",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,2

Royal Savoy Hotel,BuckyBantam,7,BuckyBantamwrote a review Sep 2021,"This is one of the more established hotels in Funchal, full of returning visitors and experienced, friendly staff. The construction of the new Savoy Palace - a Dubai-style behemoth across the road - has thankfully not had a negative impact. Indeed, it’s added to the drinking and dining options (Royal Savoy residents can access the hotel by walking across the sky bridge and using their keycards at the gate). You can also use their more extensive spa.However, for our tastes, the Royal Savoy is infinitely better. The pool area is its star attraction: two irregularly shaped and sizeable heated pools, with recliners both poolside and sequestered away in little private areas. There’s also easy and direct access to the sea for a more bracing swim if you fancy it. Poolside snacks are tasty if a little on the expensive side.The food is perhaps the one area where the quality dips slightly - the evening a la carte meals we had at both the Armada and Neptunus restaurants were disappointing for the price. Also, the breakfast buffet has great variety but the hot food was never very hot. The pastries were delicious though.The communal areas have been updated recently (not the rooms, which remain charming and comfortable) and there’s a new piano bar by reception called Thatchers. Any ambiguity about the name is soon put to rest by the cocktail menu, featuring such belters as ‘The Conservative’ and ‘The Falklands’. She came here on her holidays, apparently, and while I’m sure the hotel thought this was just a bit of fun (and indeed it’s probably a source of great pride for many of the English regulars) it put this adoptive Scot off his drink somewhat…Staff are universally lovely and helpful. The cleaning staff are excellent and our room was frequently and consistently tidied and turned down.There were some lift issues while we were here - two of the four main elevators were out of order - and this was problematic given we were encouraged to limit occupancy to two at a time due to COVID-19. These things happen, I suppose, but I was surprised the issue wasn’t resolved as a matter of urgency.But overall this was a very pleasant stay and we look forward to returning soon.",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,FairCritique4U,253,FairCritique4Uwrote a review Jun 2019,"This hotel has been completely refurbished to a high standard. As you walk in, the white paint everywhere draws you in through nice features of Long corridors, and unique design. It is extremely stylishly thought out and bar area most comfortable.The views are simply stunning of the cliff line and sea.Staff were very sweet, and whilst we only had a quick drink I have to say it had a real luxury feel to it. You could see from the clientele that it is arguably more suited to people of a high financial disposition as drinks were also on the pricey side. But with a view like this, at times you get what you pay for indeed.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,5
Royal Savoy Hotel,SpainJpr,110,SpainJprwrote a review Jun 2015,"We loved our stay at the Royal Savoy. We had a suite on the third floor with an enormous balcony overlooking the pool area and the sea beyond. With six adults and a baby, we had more than enough space. The suite is nicely furnished with a well equipped kitchen and beautiful big bathrooms.The staff are pleasant, especially the bar staff who couldn't be friendlier or more helpful.Food and drink may be more costly than elsewhere in Funchal but cheaper than the UK and of very high quality.We particularly loved the sea water pool and enjoyed the opportunity to swim in the sea from the rocks beyond the hotel pool.Try a buffet night at the restaurant and enjoy a Gin and Tonic in the Piano Bar.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Blot57,193,Blot57wrote a review May 2015,"Stayed for nearly a couple of weeks at Easter. We chose the hotel primarily for its location, half way between the strip and the old town. Checking in took a little longer than we expected, initially there was only one guy and a queue started to form, but then he was helped by another person. The information offered at check in wasn't the most extensive, and there wasn't the usual book or folder in the room telling about the hotel - you have to find things out yourself. There are A4 notices on reception and in the lift, but you have to ask a lot.Then it gets better. The one bed roomed apartment was very clean, had loads of room and has two TVs. The large beds were comfortable and the curtains can prevent all light getting in so its easy to sleep. Kitchen was well equipped, we went self catering and used the kitchen for breakfast. There is a small supermarket slightly down the hill and about 150 yards away. The lounge area has a couple of fairly comfortable wrap around chairs and sofa bed.There are four lifts for four floors so it was never necessary to wait very much. The bar was on the bottom floor and had no door. The open layout of the hotel, imagine the inside of the prison in Porridge, meant the noise from the entertainment spread throughout the hotel. Invariably it went quiet before midnight.Pool area was large and plenty of sun beds. There are two pools,Mobutu only one had water in. The larger one was being retiled throughout our stay. There was a pool bar, but in early season it was never open. The pool are couch have done with a sweep, surprising because everywhere else was spotless.Lastly the staff are wonderful. Overall great Time and we will come back.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Chris S,1,Chris Swrote a review Jul 2018,"Scenery beautiful. Food in general very good, both the breakfast buffet and a la carte restaurant. The sky bar is an amazing setting (although maybeeeee get a DJ who doesn’t play YMCA and ABBA). We had a nice spa treatment as well.On the slightly negative side the WiFi more or less just doesn’t work, and there’s minimal mobile service in rooms. So if you need to work or just want to check in then you’re a bit isolated.Would have been nice to see more pool side service.I assume not their fault given national park guidance but the walk down to the beach (hotel up on a cliff) is v dangerous. Broken fences, steps, handrails, etc. You need to be pretty athletic to do it.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,3

There’s a nice garden and patio to enjoy the sun, a cute outdoor pool and another area with an indoor pool and jacuzzi in which you can relax while still enjoying the view.We had dinner at the restaurant and the octopus and desert were delicious!

Breakfast was excellent,hot and cold buffet with many items to choose from. The only complaint that I have is that the blonde breakfast employee was beyond rude. Every morning she was moody, never once said good morning,obviously she didn't like her job very much and shouted to my wife who looked for a table saying 'Hey room number!!' You don't expect to be spoken to like that in a 5 star hotel. Would not stay here again.",Mar,2019,Mar 2019,2019-03-01,2019,2

They have cows, bulls, sheep, horses, etc in the estate.We had a 3 bedroom apartment which was very nicely done up. Minimalistic but nice. They haves preserved the exteriors from 100+ years.It is good to walk around the estate and just hang out. Good family time. They have an awesome spa and the therapists are really good too.Where they lack is in overall service and the food. I think since staff is not comfortable in English they tend not to respond well to queries especially when we were ordering for food etc in the room.Also, the food was a huge disappointment.  Apart from breakfast, all our meals were quite average. They have limited options and even within the options the food is not good. They need to improve this are.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,3

The rooms are spacious and we had a lovely balcony overlooking the pool which incidentally was wonderful - never too crowded even in august.  Tavira itself is a lovely relaxed town with good places to eat in the evening.  It's worth crossing the roman bridge to find some excellent restaurants on the other side. The beach (accessed by boat) is tranquil and if you're prepared to walk for 10 minutes from where you get off the boat you can find a little space all to yourself.  I'd recommend taking a few supplies with you ie. food and water as there's not really any places to buy stuff on the beach itself.  We would definitely reccommend Tavira and the Vila Gale Hotel!",Jan,2006,Jan 2006,2006-01-01,2006,5
Hotel Travel Park Lisboa,salsaqueen54,11,salsaqueen54wrote a review Feb 2012,Had read previous reviewer's opinion and decided to give it a go due to quality/price ratio and I was not disapointed.Went there as part of an Easyjet package holiday so very cheap (GBP 250 flight and hotel for 6 nights)  so was not expecting too much. However after an 8Euros taxi ride from the airport i got to a very pleasant hotel and reception.I had requested a double room but was told it would be a twin room for the 1st night and a change after that. my twin bed was hard but the room well appointed with a good batroom on the street side. Double room (both on 5th floor) was on terrace siDe and just as good even quieter with again a good bathroom.Used buffet breakfast twice good value for money too.

The breakfast has an incredible array of choices: meats, cheeses, fruit, breads, cereal.  Also included some atypical choices: tomatoes, cucumbers, champagne, pizza, pasteles de nata.  The espresso machines cranked out hundreds of cups each day.  The breakfast is on floor -1, but still gets natural light from an atrium through HF's middle.  Large breakfast room, looks like it seats 150-200.  The staff is outstanding!  I never saw anything run out, and there was always plenty of plates, cups, silverware, etc.  I commend HF management for investing in enough hard-working, friendly staff.
