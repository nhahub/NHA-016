Villas Barrocal,lorrainec2010,3,lorrainec2010wrote a review Aug 2012,"I booked a 2 bed apartment and actually got a 3 bed villa, The villa was great, had absolutely everything which we could have required for our stay, so many things that we didn't use :) The complex was great, very secure. Although there was a reasonably priced supermarket and a very cheap cafe round the corner unfortunately to get ant bars, restaurants etc we had to taxi to the closest town. Beach was also too far to walk to but pool area was great. Couldn't fault the accommodation but a car is more of a necessity than a luxury. would go again happily",Aug,2012,Aug 2012,2012-08-01,2012,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Holly J B,16,Holly J Bwrote a review Aug 2025,"We have just returned from a 10-day holiday with 3 generations including 70+, 12 and 15 year old and we have had the most amazing time.From the moment you arrive the staff are attentive and friendly.The room, for a family of 4 was substantial and the children's bed more or less full size. They did not have to share a sofa bed. Plenty storage and great view of the pool. The air con was a big plus. Very clean and was maintained daily. No issues at all.The hotel and grounds were spotless.  The staff constantly tidying, cleaning, nothing to complain about at all.The food and drinks was plentiful with different themes running throughout the week with other options like pizza and pasta available too. Snacks were available during pool hours, baguettes, ice cream etc. Couldn't fault it.The pool was fabulous and not cold. All pools are fine once acclimatised. The staff worked tirelessly to entertain the children and my two, even though older, joined in as they wished. The water bridge was a favourite and the foam party! Suncream stations were a handy thing to have.There were no sunbed wars..if you wanted poolside then yes head out early  but otherwise beds available.I cant really comment on the evening entertainment as the children are older, we preffered Uno in the lobby or going down to Erin's Isle pub across the way.Overall a fabulous holiday that we were sad to leave. We would recommend Slide and Splash,  Jeep Safari and Boat trips to caves. Erin's Isle good for older ones and lovely atmosphere. Thank you Jupiter Albufeira hopefully see you again!",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Gurdit s,0,Gurdit swrote a review Oct 2023,"Good food, average entertainment too late and too loud for kids aged 4 and under. Lifts were hard work probably worst ever. Would say its good not excellent. Kids club was good, pools quite cold but probably time of year. Feel the shuttle could of been more frequent rather than once a hour as it got full so should be round the clock so gives everyone an opportunity. There was so many wasps around the outdoor bar and near the bins on the grass which can be prone to stinging",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Tyla14,56,Tyla14wrote a review Apr 2018,"My wife and I are in our 70’s and stayed for three weeks at one of the Belmar apartments.  We read all the Reviews before we made the booking, but quite clearly we felt we were not staying at the same HotelThe hotel is some 30mins walk to the main Town of Lagos. One has to walk up a very steep hill out of the Hotel to get on to the main road. The bus service is very good, every hour to Lagos but again you need to walk down to the bus stop, which takes 10 minutes and on arriving back up a steep hill to the Hotel.Our Apartment was very spacious, clean and modern, excellent balconies and roof terrace. Regrettably we were invaded every day by small brown ants in the kitchen. Despite informing the cleaning staff when they visited every two days they continued to appear throughout the three weeks we were there.We arrived at the Hotel with four suitcase, after booking in, we were informed that the Hotel did not have facilities for their staff to take our cases to our apartment. Being in our 70’s we are not strongest persons on this planet.  To get to our Apartment again up a steep hill through a underground carpark, through two heavy metal doors to a small lift. We were not happy !The kitchen  in the Apartment is well equipped however, on arrival there were no bottles of water, sugar, tea bags, milk not even pepper or salt in the pots. After travelling all day we were not happy.  However, we went the Bar  for Happy Hour which cheered us up !We were recommended to book our Breakfast throughout our stay, we are very glad we did not take this advice.  The breakfast was a standard Hotel arrangement at a cost of €16 each.  !  The quality of food was rubbish, eggs were over cooked  possibly two hours before placing on a serving tray, and the bacon was like burnt crisps.   Sausages,  well cardboard in a skin. There was no variety at all. During the day and evening the Resturant sold food we did not venture  to eat there, throughout our three weeks  stay we only saw two couples in the Resturant during the evening. However, one evening we did order  salad and a takeaway Pizza which was very niceThere is a small supermarket some 20 minutes  away which we used, again to get to it one had to walk up the steep hill.  To purchase  provisions for a dinner it took one hour, and quite tiring having  to bring back bottles of water and wine as well as the food !The staff were just fine and most helpful,  it is a great pity the location of the Hotel, Resturant, and Managerment does not come up to the standard they deserve.We will not stay here again",Apr,2018,Apr 2018,2018-04-01,2018,2
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,John W,4,John Wwrote a review Oct 2022,"We had a wonderful stay at Belmar! The staff from the bartenders, to the restaurant employees, and the front desk were incredibly helpful and accommodating. We did breakfast included and were really impressed with the quality of the meals. Our room was spacious and well equipped. We had a view that looked out onto the ocean, we couldn’t have asked for more.  Pools, massages, breakfast looking out to the ocean, walking distance to the beach; Belmar has everything we needed for a relaxing and rejuvenating time in Lagos. We will definitely be returning.

Quinta Mirabela,Sue L,52,Sue Lwrote a review Mar 2016,"My husband and I have just returned from a week's stay at the Quinta Mirabel Hotel.  From the start the service was excellent.  We were greeted with a glass of sparkling wine on arrival in reception.  When shown to our room (on the first floor) it was a little small so we asked in reception if they had any further rooms available and after a short time we were shown to a room on the 4th floor which was much larger and spacious.   Whilst unpacking we were presented with a bottle of sparkling wine and some chocolates.  This is a small hotel with just over 30 rooms and offers a service which is quite unique.  Breakfast is buffet style, but the evening meal (we were half board) was waiter service (3 courses), with a la carte on 5 of the nights.  There was a candlelit evening which was 10 euros extra each, but I would not recommend paying the extra, as there were also a la carte diners in the restaurant and the only difference was two extra courses and a tealight on the table (which all tables had).  We mentioned to the Manager that it would be nice to have a little bit of atmosphere for this special evening (maybe some music or a live musician).  There are 5 courses which we struggled with as the veal course turned out to be a rather large piece of steak (on top of the salmon we have eaten in the preceding course).  The Madeiran Evening is also 5 courses, but there is no extra charge.  Again a little bit of atmosphere would have been nice.   It may be because we were only at the start of the season.  I would like to say a big 'thank you' to the Restaurant staff of Daniel, Reuben and Marina who were 'excellent' (one of Reuben's favourite words!)  The hotel is spotlessly clean and the Spa facilities are excellent (a word of advice, ask in Reception if the facilities are turned on before venturing down to the steam room, sauna and jacuzzi).  As has been said the hotel is on a VERY steep road (at the bottom of the toboggan run) so this needs to be taken into consideration when booking.  We walked down to the town a couple of times (about 30 minutes) and did not find the roadway dangerous (as a previous reviewer had said).  The bus stop (for the 19) is only a short distance from the hotel and will take you down into the Marina area.  The hotel complimentary mini bus only makes two trips a day into the town (10.00am and 17.00am) and you need to book.  We were told that Cristiano Rinaldo booked out the hotel for his family for New Year in 2012, so you cannot get a higher recommendation than this.  Our thanks also go to the Hotel Manager who made sure we had umbrella cover to the car park on our departure in the rain.",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,4

Hotel Madeira,Andy C,29,Andy Cwrote a review Dec 2018,The hotel is ideally situated within Funchal a short walk from the main shopping streets and the waterfront. The room is clean and comfortable and offers a good nights sleep. A good breakfast of continental and cooked items is available though tea is served by the cup rather than in pots but this can be requested. There is a nice rooftop terrace offering views across the city and a small swimming pool. Several nice resturants including the Ritz can be found within 10mins walk from the property. All in all a good hotel for visiting Funchal and would recommend.,Dec,2018,Dec 2018,2018-12-01,2018,4
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Bardfish,5,Bardfishwrote a review Dec 2016,"We booked this hotel because of their Trip Advisor rating and I have to say we were thoroughly impressed. We arrived really early, following a red eye flight and were given a complimentary breakfast (the lady who runs the restaturant is fabulous) while they rushed to get the room ready. Our entire stay was flawless - the staff are exceptional, hotel and decor are beautiful, nothing was too much trouble & the location is great. We can't wait to go back and would definitely recommend",Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,5
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Fairhaven8,41,Fairhaven8wrote a review Apr 2017,"We had paid extra for a deluxe room as there were no classics available. The room allocated was overlooking the building work to replace the pool. We requested to move as the room would be noisy when people were working. The staff tried very hard to sort something out and we ended up in a junior suite for 4 nights and then one of the new renovated rooms for 3 nights. Although the rooms were nicer than that allocated we needed to move twice which was inconvenient and could have been avoided if more thought had been given to room allocation originally.Only 1 restaurant was open during our stay and for the first few nights some couples eating in the hotel were sat in the corridor. Luckily we were part of a larger group so were sat in the restaurant.Obviously there was no pool during our stay and this will be a problem for any family staying over Easter.Also there is a lot of renovation work taking place at the nearby restaurants, which although open are a little difficult to get to.We also found the two hotel buffets disappointing and certainly would not have liked to have paid the price stated for them. (They were part of our package). The gala dinner on the final night was excellent  and the daily breakfast is good.The service at the hotel is excellent and the staff are friendly and can't do enough for you. The golf course was in good condition.The upgraded room was very nice, with good lighting and comfortable. our only criticism would be that the room we were allocated was tight on wardrobe space and drawers.Once the renovations are complete then the hotel will be much better as the older rooms are very dated.",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,3
Lisbon Destination Hostel,ludek87,35,ludek87wrote a review Feb 2017,"I think when booking a hostel, there are several factors every traveller is looking for:- price / quality ratio- location of the property- cleanliness- staffI'd not hesitate and rank 10/10 in all of the factors here! The staff is amazing and makes you feel like you've been part of the family, the locations - it kind of speaks for itself - is most central that you can get, the hostel is being cleaned almost constantly, Wi-Fi works well, breakfast served is amazing even though I'd appreciate eggs or ham, but that's just a minor thing...We stayed 3 days and when we were leaving, it really felt like we had to say goodbye to an old and dear friend!Absolutely recommended!!!",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Sharon F,36,Sharon Fwrote a review Sep 2016,"Lovely, well equipped apartment however the view was of the car park which was full of rubbish (old mattresses, building rubble etc). Great air conditioning and very comfy beds.Food average, poor selection for all inclusive and constantly running out and not refilling dishes. Desserts lacked variety and there is a definite lack of staff resulting in poor service for drinks. I felt really sorry for them as they constantly had complaints and were run off their feet! Why not make soft drinks available in machines like the wine and tea/coffee?? Bizarre rule that tea and coffee only available in the restaurant not the bars (didn't really get to the bottom of why this was). I did complain to the restaurant manager about the food running out and he was very apologetic and things did improve briefly.Only a couple of sun umbrellas which resulted in people queuing to get these at 7.30am. Pool bar only open from 12 so no drinks available on site before then. Barman was very rude and arrogant we found.Gym is fab and so is the location. Decent pool but needs some attention too (broken tiles, dirty in part, not enough shade).Overall it's a lovely hotel and the accommodation is great however don't go all inclusive here. It's nowhere near a 5 star!",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4
Lisbon Happy Hostel,Sofya,0,Sofyawrote a review Mar 2019,Well it’s more like motel. We got our nice room with double bed. It was not new but pretty clean. Restroom is ok too. It’s cheap and in center so you don’t expect super high quality and super cozy place. The administrators are really nice girls from Nepal.Don’t expect any hostel life - there is no party place and the atmosphere is not about communicating with other guests.Overall this hostel is ok for stay. If I would be in Lisbon one more time I wouldn’t choose it but for our trip it was convenient.,Mar,2019,Mar 2019,2019-03-01,2019,3

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,synToronto,594,synTorontowrote a review Aug 2019,"Location:  As many most certainly have mentioned, this hotel is not close to any tourist areas that are mainly concentrated in the downtown area (baxia).  The only place this hotel is within walking distance of is the zoo, and it is fairly close to the airport.  You will be a 20 minute transit ride from downtown or about the same for taxi (cost about 12 euros).  You are about 15 minutes from the airport (about 8-12 euros).Amenities:  It has an outdoor pool area, but it is small for the size of the hotel.  It also closes at 8PM which is probably too early, but it respects the guest who face pool side who may want some quiet.  There is a lounge which was on the ground floor (not the higher floors as typical).  The lounge was small and not stocked as well as other properties that we have been to.  We did not try the bar or restaurant due to time constraints.Check-in and out:  Slow and maybe slower if they have rush, but still pleasant.Rooms:  Small but clean and functional.  Rooms have a supportive bed with good sheets, a desk, safe, a walk in shower with half glass, a balcony that is functional.Service:  Depends on who you get.  Service is somewhat inconsistent, but I can see that they try.Quiet or not:  The hall was thickly carpeted so we heard very little for which I was glad.What is useful?  If you have an early flight, breakfast is not served until 6AM, but you can request a breakfast bag to go which consists of a dry ham sandwich, a small croissant with cheese, a juice box, a chocolate milk box, a banana and a breakfast bar.  Better than nothing for sure and if you need it before 6AM they will have it at the front desk.Overall:  A solid average place to stay that met our needs. It was clean and functional and had enough amenities. Its only fault perhaps is that it is more of a business hotel or last night in the city hotel, rather than a tourist hotel.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,4
Vila Galé Albacora,Veggiebird,20,Veggiebirdwrote a review Apr 2012,"We returned last week after 2 weeks at this hotel. Haven't been to Portugal since 2008, but had stayed at the Albacora for a few days then and were enchanted by it's location.Both us needed a quiet relaxing place to stay, we live in seaside resort and in the last few years have had trips to more resorty types places and wanted to avoid them, and we considered this hotel would suit us.It did the trick, the neck ache has gone, my shoulders have come down from my ears!! We had a river view room and found we were constantly looking out of the window to see what birds were out on the river. We aren't proper birdwatchers, but had our binoculars, and even without them the sight of flamingos, avocets and lots of assorted wading birds put a smile on our faces.The room was a good size, and the beds comfy (contrary to an earlier poster I like a firm bed).We sat out on the terrace after our trips out, 5-6 pm and the sun and peace washed over us.Breakfast delivered plenty of choice, and the staff were attentive, friendly and efficient in all areas. We met all types, nationalities and ages of travellers with a range of holiday needs and everyone was more than happy with the hotel.The saltpan smell which another poster mentioned, is NOT drains, we have it here when seaweed dries in the sun when the tide goes out, so I guess this also happens on the Ria Formosa natural park which is where the hotel is sited. We found some of the trees around the hotel had the most marvellous scent which was there all the time.If you want a busy vibrant resort, even in high season this ain't the place for you,if you like walking, cycling, swimming or just 'being' this is for you. Tavira is a lovely town and much more a Portuguese town that happens to have some hotels/tourists rather than a purpose built resort.Th",Apr,2012,Apr 2012,2012-04-01,2012,2
Luna Clube Oceano,Jibber08,47,Jibber08wrote a review Aug 2017,"Second time here after a week last September. This 2 week holiday didn't fill us with enthusiasm on returning.  Apartment was OK, large and plenty room.  Decent sized beds (2) which were comfy enough. Shower was terrible and had no force at all. The water in the apartment actually stopped working on two occasions during the 2 weeks we were there. Reception and communal areas were OK but the pool and the quiet zone next too the hot tubs were a disgrace.  Nothing got cleaned, sunbeds, tables or the walkways and the hot tubs were filthy.Food was poor.  Really simple choices that were overpriced.  Took the breakfast option for the 1st week but passed on the 2nd week.  Cold food and not a lot on offer. Happy hour at the bar is at an odd time (5:30pm) meaning when you went downstairs it was more than likely over and the booze isn't that cheap at the bar.Not a lot close by, few bars and mid range cafe's plus a couple of shops.  15 minute walk away from some very nice places like Splendid St and a fantastic Indian called the Great Indian Tandoori - worth a walk up.Wont return here but will come back to Albufeira, just try a different hotel the next time nearer the old town.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,2

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Jim R,4,Jim Rwrote a review Oct 2008,"This hotel is sited virtually in the middle of  a motorway junction. It is remote from the centre of Lisbon, the nearest metro station [Zoological Gardens - Blue Line] being more than 15 minutes walk away, across a scary bridge. It is not convenient as a tourist hotel, unless you want to spend a fortune on taxi fares, as we did. Some of those taxis will take you on a long ride about town, instead of taking the direct route. Avoid taxis on football match days too.This is really a business persons' hotel, or one for millionaires with chauffeur driven limousines.We thought breakfast didn't have much choice, until one day they opened the sideroom, which had extra choices.Internet services at €20 per 24 hours are overpriced.I personally can't stand having commissionaires in poncy uniforms opening taxi doors for you when I am perfectly capable of doing it myself.Drinks at the bar in the lobby OK.

Quite a bit of refurbishment had been carried out during lockdown. We had hoped that the little fridge in our studio apartment would have been swopped for a bigger one (rather than a bigger TV). Also we were a bit annoyed at lack of control of 'sunbed claiming', also children running around the pool area and children commandeering the jacuzzi.

SANA Capitol Hotel,JMPFF,105,JMPFFwrote a review May 2013,"This hotel is small, modern, well located in a small (and quiet) street nearby Marquês de Pombal metro station.Room was clean, quiet enough, with 2 confy and clean beds.Nice tv with wide selection of channels.Wifi was included.Buffet breakfast was very good, with fresh and good quality products, served in a maybe not big enough room.Very very friendly and helpfull staff.The only drawback for me was the smell in the bathroom, probably from the plumbing. Fortunately, the bathroom door was thick enough to prevent the smell to invade the bedroom, when it was closed, but anytime I used the bathroom I felt bad.Anyway, this hotel is a very good option in Lisbon.",May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,4
Pateo Lisbon Lounge Suites,Liv C,94,Liv Cwrote a review Jun 2023,"Service 10/10: the provided by the hotel staff was friendly and accommodating, creating a welcoming atmosphere throughout my visit.Location 10/10: The hotel's central location made it convenient for exploring the city's attractions within walking distance. The walk up to the castle was 10 minutes give or take!Rooms 8/10: Impeccably clean and spacious but soundproofing was nonexistent during St Antonio's public holiday celebrations. At no fault of hotel of course, they couldn't have predicted the speakers/DJ to set up right outside the hotel (underneath our room window!)The bad:Soundproofing 3/10: Soundproofing in the rooms was disappointing, as noise from outside the hotel (a narrow alleyway) echoed directly through the window and into the room. We were also unfortunate enough to have stayed during St Antonio's public holiday celebrations so there was extremely loud music and crowds outside until early hours of the morning!Facilities 3/10: the gym facilities was sparse with subpar cleanliness, pool was narrow and small unlike pictured.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,3
Hotel Gat Rossio,justin00,27,justin00wrote a review Jun 2018,"Gat Rossio is a moderate hotel.The location is great and that's it's strong point.  It's very central and 3-4 nice restaurants literally just outside (if you have just arrived late evening and don't know the city, that's really helpful).  Rossio train station is 2 minutes walk and the Aerobus stop is less than that.  All the city centre sites are in walking distance.Staff were a mixed bag.  On arrival I was asked to tick a box saying I agreed the terms and conditions.  I asked to see the Ts and Cs and was told they were on the email from when I booked.  I was then told 'if you don't accept then you can sleep on the street'.  Not sure if it was a joke which was lost in translation, but after travelling for 8 hours, I wasn't laughing.Staff in the breakfast room were efficient but clearly under instructions not to make eye contact or have any interaction whatsoever with guests, which was a shame.  The breakfast itself was disappointing with the usual selection of processed foods and a few apples and pears as the 'healthy' option.  There were no tomatoes or prepared fruits (there is a lovely fruit shop just round the corner selling water melon, peaches, figs etc. so it makes the breakfast selection even more disappointing) but there is a fresh orange juice machine.  Breakfast also has to be taken on long tables with stools and on busy days you just have to muck in and sit with others.  TIP:  take your breakfast outside on the terrace.The bedroom was badly designed, or as a 'design' hotel would describe it, 'quirky'.  The television was not visible from the bed and it was virtually impossible to open the bathroom door from the inside without standing on the toilet.  I wouldn't recommend the rooms for any one is not able bodied or to the elderly.On the plus side the place is clean and quiet, the terraces are quite nice and the location is very good.  Overall it's not bad, however, I would be very surprised if there are not better options in central Lisbon.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,3

We had a lovely, very spacious, one bedroom apartment with a pool view which was very clean on arrival and kept this way by our lovely maid throughout our stay. Although a little dated, it had everything we needed. The air con worked a treat and the shutters made it secure and dark, so no early morning wake ups!There were plenty of sun beds so no panic to rush out and get one.....always a bonus on holiday.

You need a car to go anywhere unless you are intent to stay in the hotel/spa which is very nice but there is a limit to how much I can stay inside.  Taxi is not cheap.  The gym is very small, hardly enough room for a mat to do stretches.  The restaurant is fine (though expensive and limited menu).  The rooms are not sound proof.  We could hear other people in their rooms talking on the phone or watching TV.  Worst of all is the lack of privacy in the bathroom area, which is separated from the bedroom by a glass wall and a see-through curtain.  It is horrible.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,2

The hotel is fantastic, loads of space, stunning pool and very modern. We stayed half board, the food is amazing, I have been to quite a few hotels all around the world, but the food at the Crowne Plaza really is right up there with the best!!The hotel really has a relaxed peaceful vibe! Even though England football was on and quite a few groups of golfers at the hotel, the atmosphere was pretty chilled!The best bit in my view was the staff, in the restaurant they were so friendly and couldn't do enough for you! Always smiling and cheerful. The reception staff also brilliant, nothing was to much trouble. We will definitely go back !!As said just had a week there and I know this is just a snapshot but our experience really was fab, same for Vilamoura lovely place.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4
Luna Hotel Da Oura,smythy53,15,smythy53wrote a review Jul 2017,"Stayed here for 6 days. We had a 2bedroom duplex apt which was really big and spacious. Downfall about the apartment was that we had 2 balconies and only one table and one chair yet the apartment sleeps up to 6 pple. Nowhere to sit and enjoy the evening sun on the balcony. Location was close to the strip and a further distance from the old town, although taxis are very cheap. This hotel does accept large groups as we had a stag party staying in the 2apts next to us. Chanting strange noises at 11:30pm before they went out and banging on doors in the early hours. This particular group where extremely intimidating one morning early at the pool. This would make me reluctant to return again in the future.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

Hotel Albergaria Dias,TiptreeJams,57,TiptreeJamswrote a review Aug 2011,"An excellent small friendly hotel in the old part of Funchal. We were welcomed by the staff and the owner on arrival and had a free welcome drink.Our room with a sea view across the old town was lovely and had a balcony with chairs / table. Air conditioning was in the room which you could switch on and off as you liked. Large bathroom and large bedroom with a chair and table and a dresser with stool.  The dresser contained a small fridge which you could use to keep drinks, fruit  cold. I had emailed them directly in advance (via their website) requesting fresh fruit and a bottle of wine and it was all ready in the room with glasses.The hotel has small gym, a sauna, a book library (various languages), and a computer you can use. There is free WiFi as well in the main hotel which I did pick up on the balcony of our room (Floor 3).Breakfasts were excellent with fresh fruit salad, cheeses, hams, rolls, bread, salad items, cakes, croissants, home made jams (including banana), omelets, eggs etc and copious amounts of tea, coffee, and juices. You can eat inside or outside near the pool.There is a lovely swimming pool and sun beds which did not get too crowded like some of the larger hotels. There is also a well kept garden with gorgeous flowers.Most people use the bottom exit to access the town. We only used the top exit when we were picked up by minibus for the airport and trips around the island. Re-entry to both exit gates is via your room card which releases the lock or you can buzz them at the gate and they let you in.The hotel does do tasty snacks (sandwiches, salads, cakes) from 11.30am  to 3.00pm and the bar serving tea, coffee, cocktails, wine etc is open  most of the day.The restaurants in the town are only a couple of minutes walk away. We tried many and they all served tasty food at reasonable prices. Many do a set tourist menu or you can pick various courses. The cable car up to the tropical gardens etc is close by as well.We had a lovely 2 week stay at the hotel and wished we could have stayed longer.  The owner and staff came to see us off and shook our hands.",Aug,2011,Aug 2011,2011-08-01,2011,5
Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Sheharyar A,143,Sheharyar Awrote a review Aug 2017,"I've been to probably over a few dozen 5 star hotels but I tell you nothing comes close to this hotel when it comes to service. Whether you ask them to get you cigarettes when all the shops are closed or you need more suitcases and are too tired they will go to the market and buy them for you. I can't say enough about the level of service these guys provide......it's shockingly good and I can clearly say I've never come across a hotel that offered this level of service. They make you feel welcome from the second you enter their property catering to any wish you might have.The location is excellent with great views, a lot of historic sites within walking distance. The rooms are big, modern and clean with great housekeeping.I'm simply in love with this hotel and can't thank them enough for making our stay a memorable one.Thank you Altis Belem.

Hotel Albergaria Dias,DianeBrooks,16,DianeBrookswrote a review Jan 2009,"We have just returned home after spending a week at Albergaria Dias. We were recommended by some friends of ours, they had been the year before and loved the place, they told us all about the hotel and about the owners and they were spot on with everything.From the moment we walked in reception we were met by Mr. Dias and members of staff who throughout  all of our holiday were smiling and very helpful.The breakfast was absolutely  wonderful, more than anyone could eat and the fresh fruit salad was made fresh everyday.We took particular notice of all the crockery on the tables, it was all gleaming like brand new and the table linen was crisp white and lovely and soft.From our room we had a lovely view  from balcony and there was a nice seating area., the room was nicely set out with plenty of wardrobe space.We had lunch round the pool sometimes which was very nicely served.The touts outside the restaurants were a bit of a pain but I superpose that is part and parcel of being abroad, we did find some very nice restaurants in what they call the old town but I suggest you keep away from the restaurants on the harbor on the boats we has a awful meal there.The cable car trip was well worth the money, going on a clear day helped because you can get  great pictures of Funchal, stay clear of the tour buses as they are a rip of and VERY EXPENSIVEHiring a car is well worth the money to see the other side of the Island.The Dias family should to extremely proud of all the work they put in to their hotel and well deserve all the comments about their fantastic hotel on tripadvisorWhy do they call it the hidden gem..............go and find out, book direct with them it will be a great benefit to you, AND they send a taxi to the airport to pick you up, what more can yo ask.Are we going back..............yes we are.",Jan,2009,Jan 2009,2009-01-01,2009,5

They were all incredibly friendly and made the whole stay a better one.The breakfast offered here was more substantial than in many hostels and actually included some hot food. Additionally the four course dinner offered for only ten euros was excellent.Additionally the hostel was in a prime location and had clean new facilities.

Casa de Sezim,Anfrist,433,Anfristwrote a review Oct 2019,"The estate is very beautiful, with red walls around it. It has very big rooms with elegant decorations and there are also few common areas pleasant to spend time in. The wall tapestry is one of the special things. A terrace offers a view towards gardens, beautiful to admire and relax. The check-in and check out were effective. The breakfast was only one type of cheese and ham, so nothing special, but then overall ok enough as there is yoghurt, milk, eggs, bacon and sweets. Tea and kettle in the room, very appreciated. We did not try the wines, but they won many awards, so probably they are good. The owner was nice, in a formal approach, but quite clear and helpful.None of these things are truly significant, to be fair, but they had small impact and there was also no clear differentiator. This is located slightly outside the city, 10 minutes by car in an area which is not attractive for walking. The room was just a bit cold on October, but we came from previous hotel where the heaters were burning for us. I would have liked to get more info , then I looked it up on the Internet and there is a nice story about it).",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,4

Free voucher for a drink at the bar (may have been because I was staying 3 nights). Lisbon is lovely and the people are welcoming and helpful.

She's a real asset for this hotel. Vitor at the Lobby Bar was also very nice and friendly and helpful. The sour puss who checked us in (I think his name started with a G) should not be in the hospitality industry.
