Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,nexus153,19,nexus153wrote a review Aug 2021,Bel mar is very nice looking hotel. It’s has nice outdoor and indoor pools.  The apartments are modern. Although we got one in a garage up a little stair. The hotel is about a 4 min walk to a very nice beach. And about a 5 min drive to incredible cliffs you can get a boat to tour you around. A must do. The town about 10 min drive is interesting and kind of funky. Plenty of tourists partying.But I have to leave a poor review because the attitude of the people at the desks are downright rude. It’s bizarre in this kind country. Maybe they think it’s so nice that they can be rude. But the service is quite bad and openly rude.Someone needs to fire all the staff and hire people who know how to be friendly.I would recommend somewhere else just for this reason.,Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Nata963,7,Nata963wrote a review Oct 2013,"We stayed for 4 nights on october (end of season). Hotel is really great : large modern apartments with kitchen, living room and spacey bedroom, private balcony with view at the ocean, pools, sauna, friendly english speaking staff and beach is two minutes walk away (there are two beach restaurants)... I recommend it to anyone who comes to visit portugal by car and wants unforgettable holiday !",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,5
Vila Gale Porto Ribeira,carposmrs,116,carposmrswrote a review Dec 2019,"My husband and I love Vila Gale hotels and we recommend them all the time, unfortunately we won't be able to recommend this hotel.The hotel is situated on the banks of the Douro river (a beautiful spot) about 15 to twenty minutes walk along the river from the Riberia district.That's great if you want to eat or cross the river, but if you want to visit the town , the Cathedral or the train station if you have to hike up all the hills Porto has to offer. From the train station (which is a must see) it's an hour round trip walking.A tram runs in front of the hotel or you can get the bus but they run on a limited schedule and to be fair it's still going to take you half an hour to get to the town.One of my pet hates is no tea and coffee in the rooms. There are no coffee shops near the hotel ( there are some bars and restaurants) so in my opinion there should be tea and coffee facilities in the rooms.There is some beautiful artwork in the rooms. Our room was called the Michelangelo room, it was small, well decorated however when I opened the curtains we were about 10 feet away from the next building and basically if anyone had been working in the building next door over the weekend it would have been as if they were in our room, that's how close it was!There is no actual seperate bathroom,  the toilet is in a cubicle which doesn't have a solid door so there is very little privacy. The shower which is large and luxurious is opposite the toilet cubicle. Very strange set up.The hotel is clean and well presented. However, as it's very small the check in area is in the middle of the dining/breakfast room.The location of this hotel really didn't suit us. We were only in Porto for a 3 day city break and  (even with the public transport available ) we had to trek every time we wanted to go anywhere.We will definitely stay in Vila Gale hotels again but definitely not in this one.",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,2

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,TravellingScarborian,81,TravellingScarborianwrote a review Oct 2023,"We booked this hotel for 7 nights for 2 adults and one 3 year old. Upon arrival we arrived around 1pm but wasn’t able to check in until 3pm so had to wait around and store luggage. Never had a warm feel and welcome to the hotel, just seemed “another number”. Large reception area to sit and wait for buses, taxis etc. they do a free transfer bus to the local town but it is always full and we had to end up paying for a taxi most of the time due to it been full- they should be more frequent transfers due to size of hotel. They were always off on their timings, would leave before the official pick up time.We felt the rooms were average, no baths, sheets always stained, didn’t clean the room twice, uncomfy beds, two singles pushed together. You can hear the lifts in your room beeping which is annoying. Put us on 10th floor next to rooftop bar with a 3 year old so could hear everyone leaving. Couldn’t go onto the balcony as it was dangerous to be up there with a 3 year old. She had to sleep on a sofa bed rather than a normal bed.No iron in rooms, had to request one.The pools were ok, just couldn’t understand why the children’s slide/water area was cold and the other small children’s pool was heated with the big pool also been cold. Sun loungers get taken fast so you tend to miss out if you’re not fast. Long queues around the pool bar, understaffed.We thought the entertainment was pretty poor, in a tent which fills up very fast meaning you have to stand if you’re not quick. Music far too loud for younger children. Had trampoline and bouncy castle, you have to pay and by card only!We used the spa for happy hour 6:30-7:30 for sauna, jacuzzi and steam but they allowed children in which we didn’t understand. We went in to relax but there were many children playing in there.Gym looked good although we didn’t use it.We took our little girl to the children’s group, staff friendly and she enjoyed it.The restaurant was a joke. Had to queue outside when it was busy, not big enough for the hotel, didn’t feel staff friendly in there. Buffet style food, always luke warm, tasteless and dry food. The buffet is tiny compared to the restaurant and hotel numbers- always queues for food. The desserts and fruit area was bigger than the food area!  There was a children’s area which was ok if they like dry fish fingers and cardboard like nuggets.Coffee machine was always dodgy. One toasting machine for the whole hotel.We were given 2 vouchers for 2 extra restaurants which were very good. Food much better quality and friendlier staff. One a rodizio, all you can eat meat and the other a normal restaurant where you get 3 course meal.We tried getting a drink at 11:30 and tried to charge us! Although bars don’t stop until 12pm.Plenty of good things to do in the area, new town, old town, villamoura, beaches, zoomarina - although we thought was poor for the price.Overall, it was an ok hotel would probably score it top end of 3 star low end of 4.Would recommend without all inclusive but all inclusive I think you can get better for your money.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,2
Saccharum,Bluefoxx672014,70,Bluefoxx672014wrote a review Feb 2017,"We booked this hotel as a honeymoon celebration which was unfortunately delayed due to my operation last year. We had got what we thought was already a great deal for a double courtyard room, but ...... Wow!! ......on arrival, we found that they had not only upgraded us to a truly amazing junior suite, with a sea view, but had thrown fresh rose petals all over the bed! It gets better as, when we returned to our suite, after taking a look around this spectacular hotel, we found a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolates on our pillow!! We were later invited to have a tour of the Kitchens with the hotel manager, where we were given samples of biscuits and Madeira wine! The kitchens were immaculate ( & my husband should know as he was a head chef in a previous life!) & we ended our first day with a superb meal in their a la carte restaurant. As if we hadn't been spoiled enough already, we came back to our suite to discover full turn down service, complete with a coconut macaroon!!! We have never experienced this level of luxury and after a rainy arrival, it is now a beautiful sunny day, so we couldn't be happier 😎",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Susanna S,29,Susanna Swrote a review Feb 2025,"We stayed at Tivoli Carvoeiro several times in 2024, the last being in December.  Check-in is always very friendly and staff are very helpful.  Our room was very comfortable on all visits.  Probably a little tired in places but overall very good.  The highlight of the hotel is the breakfast buffet and if seated by the window or outside balcony area you have a wonderful view of the sea.  The rooftop bar is wow factor and we have enjoyed many evenings there with lovely drinks and snacks.  The outside pool area and actual pool were a bit tired when there in the summer but we could see renovation work on them in December.The hotel is based a nice walk away from Carvoeiro and some lovely restaurants in this area too.All in all, lovely friendly hotel with wow factor views.",Feb,2025,Feb 2025,2025-02-01,2025,4
Lisbon Destination Hostel,KCostaE,0,KCostaEwrote a review Sep 2019,"After arriving to Lisbon from Porto, Portugal, I was somewhat disappointed in my inability to meet new people in hostels as a solo-traveler. I met  two cool people from England and Holland however. Reaching Lisbon Destination Hostel changed everything. The excursions the hostel does daily allowed me too meet and go out with a dozen people from the hostel throughout my stay. The excursions were easy to join, and the  kitchen and common-area were very easy to use, and had a nice friendly vibe to them. Best hostel I stood at in Portugal.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4
Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,Yolanda C,9,Yolanda Cwrote a review Jan 2018,"Christmas isn't the best time to travel to Portugal as most restaurants and wineries are closed for the holidays but Rui, Olivia and Barbara did their best to make sure we enjoyed this city.Casas do Porto is conveniently located near fabulous restaurants and a few blocks away from Intercontinental.  Our little apartment was clean and comfortable.   We were in Porto for 4 nights with our two kids (13 and 7) who loved sharing a single bathroom with us.   Fresh breads were delivered to our apartment daily which was a nice touch.We loved the tours Rui recommended ... particularly the walking food tour!     Rui and Olivia also started a touring company Experience D'ouro which provided exclusive tours, transfers and tours/ tastings at the different vineyards.   Must say our trip was perfectly planned so we didn't have to do all that research and organization.  Very happy!",Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,4

Pestana Vila Lido,Sara P,10,Sara Pwrote a review Sep 2025,"Just returned from a week spent at this hotel and we were delighted with our choice having been to Madeira several times and each time trying a new hotel. The location of the hotel is superb and the access to the sea was a plus for us. The pool area and all the staff that work in and around there are fabulous. The rooms are kept at a high standard of cleanliness so again great staff. Breakfast - the hotel caters for all nationality’s and the choice is a plentiful. They work had replenishing items and I assume it is the manager that is constantly wiping down and cleaning up to ensure all holiday makers get the best experience. We did not encounter anyone that was not welcoming or accommodating - well done to all the staff! The room had everything we needed, we had a couple of small issues which were reported and rectified promptly and yes there was a bit of paint peeling off in the bathroom but that was minor. The ceiling fan was a great addition to complement the air conditioning. Areas around the hotel were well maintained, rubbish bins had lids on - fantastic! Check in and out was simple and prompt, absolutely nothing negative to say only positives. We plan to return next year as for us it was everything we were looking for in beautiful Madeira. Well done to everyone in the team that contributes to guest experience.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,4
Pestana Vila Lido,jothra,5,jothrawrote a review Oct 2024,"Friendly and service-minded staff. The best rooms have a fantastic view of the sea and seaside. A good number of restaurants nearby, some quite high standard.The hotel does not quite live up to the five stars they claim. Some areas of improvement: Turndown service was often just chocolate delivery in the evening, breakfast was basic with long lines of people in front of only two coffee machines, several days of really cheap juice for breakfast, the sparkling wine offered for breakfast was also low quality, some days of missing replenishment of coffee in the room.Apart from this we enjoyed our stay and were also able to get an upgrade to one of the best rooms on the top floor. Great place to enjoy both sunrise and sunset!",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,AngieBabes,163,AngieBabeswrote a review Sep 2014,"We have been going to the Dona Filipa for many years because it has a fantastic location near the beach and right next to the heart of Vale do Lobo i.e. the Praca with all of the restaurants and bars and kids activities. My daughter insists we stay here because it is so handy! If it wasn't for the location we wouldn't have stayed here because the hotel rooms are a bit \"worn\" as it is an old hotel. However, the hotel is in the process of being refurbished following a change of ownership. The reception area looks more modern and welcoming following refurbishment (be warned if you are planning to stay here any time soon as the refurbishment is still in progress so be prepared for noise). If you have kids and you want a great location near the Praca, to keep them occupied at night, then this is a good place to stay. I would perhaps wait until next Summer and you can see the fully refurbished article.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,laura1961,99,laura1961wrote a review Jun 2016,"This was our 3rd stay here. The two previous stays were faultless.The good points are:Pleasant reception staff and clean attractive public areas inside the hotel.The apartments are large, very clean, great comfortable beds, good air con,free good wifi and well equipped with 2 large tv's, full size fridge freezer, dishwasher and washing machine.My husband had his birthday while on we were there and a bottle of sparkling wine was delivered to our room. Nice touch.However ............ 5star hotel and stag/hen parties do not go together!!!!Three large groups arrived during our stay and were noisy and untidy around the pool. This disturbed other guests.Also the pool area left a lot to be desired. For the first two days of our stay the pool and surrounding area were not cleaned , rubbishy blowing around where you sat. When cleaning did take place it was after guests were already around the pool in the morning , staff member hosing the dirt on the ground into the pool.There are only about 10 umbrellas around the pool area of which several are broken. Some of the remaining ones are dangerous as the base is too light and they blow over in the wind.Hotel needs to invest in pool area with new and more quality 5 star umbrellas and cleaning around the pool area needs to be vastly improved.Hotel is selling itself as 5 star, however currently only 3 star at best.They need to improve / change their policies as repeat customers will not be coming back and all they will be left with is their stag/hen parties.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,3

Luna Clube Oceano,JosieM76,1,JosieM76wrote a review Oct 2013,"Me and a friend are just back from a weeks stay here. We had paid for a studio apartment but when we opened the door to the room we were given discovered they had given us a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment! Perhaps it was quieter due to end of season and upgraded us, but we were delighted! Lovely place, staff extremely helpful, and the room was very clean, with maid service and clean towels etc every single day.Only a 5 minute walk to the beautiful beach, ten minute walk to the strip and a 15 minute walk to the old town, or you could hop on the little train to take you there for a couple of euro.All in all, I would recommend these apartments and I'd stay here again if I went back to Albufiera.And there was cutlery in the kitchen, just not where it should have been! We found it on day 2 under the sink underneath a dish towel!",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,5

Especially Catrina who was our favourite lady on reception. There were 5 of us and she remembered names, room numbers, she was amazing. Always smiling too. The rooftop top terrace was a great place for prosecco with friends. The sun was out but also lots of shade if you wanted it. So relaxing. The breakfast needs a mention. Everything you can think of on the buffet and all fresh and regularly topped up. Not a bad word to be said about this hotel.

They had immense local information, helped with my problems with a hire car, suppoted me with telephone calls in Portuguese, and all with a smile!

Beautiful, clean and peaceful....all that we wanted from holiday - 5 star attention. Only problem was that on the Wednesday night we received a letter on return from another marvellous dinner saying that the pools would be closed to guests from Thursday to Saturday due to a travel awards ceremony. We were so down hearted. We asked to see the manager and he met with us for coffee...he offered us a day trip around the island in a private limo on the Saturday (whilst all the setting up of a stage etc was happening) and a dinner in the grounds with a violinist. This was very kind and we did appreciate it, especially as we had a fab tour of Madeira with our wonderful guide, Ricardo. However, we returned to our room on Saturday night and all we could hear from our 'peaceful' balcony was the sycophantic awards people, who were very ignorant to the fee paying guests, despite them being Travel agents....really!! We phoned down and they agreed was very noisy,,,,stopped about 1130 and we left the following day. We went to pay our bill and it had been waved! Fantastic response by the hotel and we did appreciate it but we really just wanted our quiet holiday! We would love to come back to Reid's as it was one of the best hotels we have ever been to...we are very fussy!

Preceded by a walk in the gardens, lovely despite still being February, the staff are welcoming, friendly and solicitous ensuring that everything is just so albeit with no extravagant accompanying gestures. The selection of teas is bewildering (the four of us had four different ones which made for a protrusion of the Wedgwood teapots!), there is a perfect balance between savoury, sensible size scones held back so one received them warm after the sandwiches, and a huge variety of cakes reflecting Madeira classics as well as others.

Quinta do Mirante - ANC Resort,Kirstine1984,85,Kirstine1984wrote a review Jun 2021,"We stayed here for 5 nights and had a wonderful stay. The place is quietly located and with a nice pool area right at the coast with a wonderful view - and no noise! After 2 nights, we had a weird smell in our room, coming from the kitchen. The staff reacted by upgrading us to another room, very nice! In general, staff was super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good, rooms were spacious with good beds, and all very clean. We would definitively come back!",Jun,2021,Jun 2021,2021-06-01,2021,5
Royal Savoy Hotel,Delia P,317,Delia Pwrote a review Feb 2019,"Before I start, we Need to reinforce our love of this hotel.  The staff, the service and the accommodation here are outstanding though it is true to say the place is ready for the planned upgrades later this year.My one gripe and it’s a continual one is the food offering. For a five star hotel the choices here are so poor. The Al la Carte menu should be available every day and the buffets should be left to a three and four star facility or an all inclusive hotel. There is no place for it here.The menus are repetitive and almost the same as they were when we first came twenty years ago and to respond each time by saying the food is popular is simply not true.  Read the reviews - please.The discount given to RSVC members  still go nowhere to addressing the issue if the food is inferior, particularly when there are so many fantastic culinary delights on offer in other restaurants nearby at a lot less cost. Most residents of timeshare are driven into their rooms to dine or eat elsewhere having experienced this second rate food offering on previous occasions. We had lunch by the pool and it was woeful. The bread roll was stale, the hamburger costs a fortune and chips were extra and my chicken wrap was in a tortilla that was so old if it had been given another day it would have crumbled rather than rolled into a wrap. Absolutely dreadful. No amount of visual niceties could detract from how bad it was. I would like nothing more than to eat fantastic food in our hotel but at this standard no amount of discount can tempt me to eat here more than once.  The Royal Soiree is the only tempting food offering and at €115 per person it is almost as expensive as the Michelin restaurants and only just hits the mark to be considered an acceptable price.  It is purely our loyalty that makes us continue to try to eat in. Please please consider our comments and take them in the spirit they are intended. We have tried to resolve this matter last year with the food and beverage manager but alas it appears to have fallen on deaf ears. I understand it takes time to introduce change but a menu can be changed instantly if you have a chef who understands innovation and enjoys challenge. Send him to Armazém do Sal, Il Gallo d’Oro, the Beresford and Quinta Casa Branca then he can see what quality and five star food is all about.",Feb,2019,Feb 2019,2019-02-01,2019,2
Villas D. Dinis Charming Residence Adults Only,Jill,4,Jillwrote a review May 2014,"We stayed at Vilas D. Dinis in May 2014 to visit the Algarve region. We had an amazing experience and absolutely loved the place. It was so beautiful with all the flowers and plants. The front desk was very helpful and organized, they even gave us a packed lunch as we were checking out very early in the morning. The location is great, it is about a 10-15 minute walk to town, and only a 5 minute walk to Dona Ana beach (named #1 beach in the world in 2012). The rooms were also very nice and safe. They had a fridge enough to hold some beers, wine and some fruit. There was also a safe, iron, flat screen tv and AC. Overall the rooms were clean, spacious and enough for a couple. If you are planning a trip to Algarve and deciding between Albufeira and Lagos we would definitely choose Lagos. We are a couple who likes to go out and drink and have fun and be close to the beach but does not want the crazy loudness that Albufeira may have. We would highly highly recommend this place and definitely come again.",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,4

Natura Algarve Club,Mark R,0,Mark Rwrote a review Sep 2022,"We thoroughly enjoyed our weeks stay at the Natura. All of the staff were excellent and nothing was to much trouble. The appartment was very spacious with loads of room and storage. The gardens and pool area were immacuately kept and sunbeds were always avaiable. One or two people did reserve them but there was really no need. The main pool was divided in to four so it was safe for swimmers of all abilities. There is a smaller toddlers pool so everyone is catered for. We did have snacks from the bar and found them to be good quality and reasonably priced.The Natura is located on a quiet street although its only a couple of hundred metres to a great selection of bars, cafes and resteraunts. Special mention to the Royal Chinese restaurant and the Little Britain Cafe.There is a good bus service next to the toutist information centre again just a couple of hundred metres away. The explorer bus leaves from here and a 22 euro pass covers you for 2 days. The blue route goes to Villamaura and the red route to the Old Town and beyond. Taxis to the Old Town cost 7 euros each way. The strip is a ten minute walk however we either used the local bars or went in to the Old Town.",Sep,2022,Sep 2022,2022-09-01,2022,4

Was immaculately clean on arrival and made up to the same standard every day.Excellent selection for breakfast and lovely breakfast area - airy and cool. You could sit outside if you wanted to.We used the restaurant for a few lunches and dinners.

Ocean Gardens,DavidL952,20,DavidL952wrote a review Sep 2017,"Lovely hotel with large clean room, large bathroom with bidet and quiet for sleeping. The view of Funchal from the room balcony and the hotel restaurant  is outstanding both by day and at night. On our last morning we were up earlier to witness the full moon reflecting on the sea over the bay. Transport to the town could be made by hotel shuttle if pre booked or by no. 39 bus from just outside the hotel, takes about 10 minutes and a slightly precarious ride depending on the bus driver.The reception staff were helpful, the restaurant staff were friendly but the breakfast staff quiet.The hot food  at breakfast was limited to chopped frankfurters or bacon and sliced mushrooms, eggs , fried poached or boiled  and there was cereal, fruit, yogurts, cake and croissants. The food in the restaurant in the evening was well cooked and the portions on the large size.The view of Funchal  could be appreciated at breakfast at an outside table and at the restaurant in the evening.This is what makes the hotel so attractive.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4
Cidnay Santo Tirso - Charming Hotel & Executive Center,Serg_Christie,39,Serg_Christiewrote a review Jul 2014,"This hotel is located in the small town of Santo Tirso, about 30min from Porto. When we booked to stay here for 1 night we were not too sure what to expect, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. The hotel interior is very tasteful and modern, the layout is also interesting with the rooms on floors below reception. The views from the bar and restaurant are stunning, overlooking the mountains and vineyards. Our room was a \"mountain view\" room which was well worth the small extra cost. Nice touches included the complimentary port from the bar, the pillow selection as well as the tea and biscuits at bed time.Buffet breakfast was included in our rate and we were very happy with the selection. One negative point would be that several of the dishes were practically empty and when we requested a refill we were met with some reluctance. Perhaps this is because they do not want to over cater given a limited number of guests? We also did not have anyone remove our used plates which caused the table to become a bit messy.",Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,4

We come to Lisbon annually (from San Francisco) to visit my husband's elderly cousin--she turned 92 in December.  We love Hotel Travel Park for several reasons:  it is very clean, the Staff is awesomely great, breakfast is included and very good, free wifi and the location is excellent.I note that some reviewers have commented that the location is sketchy.  This is not a super ritzy area, but living in a big city--I know what a sketchy neighborhood is--and this one certainly is not! In eight years, we have never experienced the slightest  problem.  Further, the elderly cousin and several of her elderly fiends have lived in the neighborhood for years and love it.  All of the shops and restaurants are not fancy, but typical city places.Added hint: There is a new restaurant a couple of blocks away on Rua do Forno do Tijolo.

Plaza Ribera is right on the river and is the main meeting place for residents and tourists.  The plaza and riverfront walkway are filled with restaurants and bars and it is lively late into the evening.  The port houses are just a 15 minute walk away across the bridge and the main part of town is a 15 minute walk.

Turim Marques Hotel,beth1966,39,beth1966wrote a review Sep 2019,"This hotel is very close to a good subway line, buses are across the street and it’s right by a fashionable (expensive) neighborhood. But as a place to stay, it’s just ok.Our room was small and strange, with the sink outside the shower/toilet room and right near the bed. It wasn’t a great use of space and made it tough for one person to use the sink area quietly and let the other person sleep.The buffet breakfast was adequate: lukewarm eggs, bacon and cereals and yogurt with very good pastries. But the coffee was an embarrassment: it’s not fresh, it comes out of a cafeteria style machine (you press buttons for coffee, cappuccino or milk). My boyfriend got the staff to bring him an espresso.The staff were very nice. They recommended a nearby seafood restaurant they told us was very good but we found it overpriced and mediocre.

Breakfast is super. Our latest trip, a few days ago, was reassuring as well. Amid all the turmoil originated by the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the staff of Casa Vela has not disappointed us. Everything was thoroughly disinfected. The staff was totally covered with masks and gloves.  Services were at high top. We felt very safe and we will certainly go back in the future.

We were therefore expecting another great stay.  The hotel is clean although we did have an issue with our first room that had ants on the bathroom floor, when we notified the front desk, we were given an other room which was fine, but I would have appreciated some sort of apology for the inconvenience.  The service at the hotel was uneven, the staff friendliness is not consistant, it’s unfortunate.  The second room we got was clean but very dark, very little lighting, and a very small window, the room configuration was odd.  The bed was small and the mattress was hard, the pillows need to be changed, totally uncomfortable.  It wasn’t a bad hotel but definitely not great, there must be better options in Lisbon!",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,3

Situated about ten minutes walk from the town centre which is full of restaurants, cafes and bars - and of course the museums.It is about fifteen minutes walk from the train station which is handy for day trips to Lisbon. (Although I would highly recommend if you intend to arrive with your luggage by train that you get a taxi from the station as the route is hilly in places and the pavements are cobbled!) In the other direction are the Boca do Inferno cliffs, about fifteen minutes walk.The hotel itself is set in lush green landscaped gardens with two swimming pools and various water features. Our room (number 28) had a large private patio, a sofa and a kitchenette. The staff were very helpful and approachable; special thanks to Milene for her dedication to customer service. We opted for breakfast which was a continental style buffet, fresh and delicious that was constantly replenished.

Myriad By Sana,Denverreviewer2,11,Denverreviewer2wrote a review May 2017,"This spectacular hotel is located in an ideal location for travel through Lisbon using the plane (2 miles) or train (one mile).  It's only real flaw is that it is not really convenient (but still doable) to downtown Lisbon.The amenities are first class, particularly if you pay for a suite (very large size, we got a complimentary upgrade when we visited twice in two weeks).  I would guess all the rooms have the spectacular views both of ours did.  The numerous staff are always available and willing to do whatever you need to make your stay go well.The included breakfast was the best we had in Portugal.  The hotel accommodates a variety of travelers, the extensive choices are designed to ensure that every one of them has what they prefer.It's located in a park setting near the aquarium.  There are several restaurants within a block, more only slightly farther.  Nice opportunities for a pleasant walk, be it long or short.The only thing I would imagine someone being seriously uncomfortable with is that the bathrooms are somewhat open to the rest of the room.  The toilet is in a separate room, but it too may not be separate enough for some, the door is sliding, and both it and the walls are glass, with the bottom strategically frosted.None of my comments is enough for me to rate the hotel anything less than five stars.We were flying in and out of Lisbon, and traveling by train to other areas.  I can't imagine a hotel better suited to that.  The train station also has transportation downtown, of course.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4

Style over substance, as in a lot of these designer hotels. In the designer world, nobody ever gets old, and we wouldn't want anybody who wasn't perfect spoiling our vision, would we?
