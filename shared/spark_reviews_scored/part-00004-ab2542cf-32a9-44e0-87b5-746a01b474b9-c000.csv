Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,D4357,2,D4357wrote a review Jul 2023,"Hotel was very clean and well maintained please thanks all staff, food was out of this world chefs deserve massive amount of praise for the food they produce. The only issue is the elevators 10 people called an elevator we all had to wait for the same one yet there is 5 elevators, so when someone calls an elevator 1 should come for each call not wait for the same one in which means someone or some people won't fit on then will have to wait to call another one to come so maybe sort that out, also the house keeping team twice my fiancee was in the shower and they knocked there was no answer this was at 630pm as there was no answer they let themselves in surely at 630pm you would think people are getting ready for dinner and this maybe why they are not answering yes its nice they giving chocolates out but they could leave them after cleaning the room instead of coming back and walking in on someone in the shower but other than that the hotel was fantastic and would definitely come back",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,4
Herdade Da Matinha,W A,5,W Awrote a review Jul 2013,"This place is amazing!  We were sorry we had only booked two nights at Matinha as the area has so much to offer and the hotel itself was so lovely.  It is a very quiet area of the Alentejo, but a nice break from the hectic Algarve.  Perhaps overpriced for the area but you could easily make this up with the breakfast that is included :)  Breakfast had pretty much anything you could wish for, including eggs made to order.  We asked for recommendations to grab lunch to the beach and the hotel packed us sandwiches which too were terrific.  And we ended up liking the place so much, we stayed in for dinner one night.  There are endless options for lounging around the property, depending upon whether you want privacy or a more social environment.  The staff all speak English (and many other languages).  Other than summer, this place seems like it would be very cozy, pleasant in the autumn.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,5
Mayer Apartments,Patrice S,0,Patrice Swrote a review Oct 2016,"We stayed at this property and enjoyed 3 beautiful weeks in Portugal.  The location is perfect and the apartments are authentic, very clean and well maintained.Adrian and Jan are fantastic...friendly and very helpful. They made suggestions for excursions and then completed the bookings on our behalf.The pool is great and the bar area was a lovely place to have breakfast or lunch.  There are dozens of great restaurants to walk to and the beach is very picturesque with clear water and beautiful sandstone cliffs.We will look forward to returning.",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,5
Vila Gale Collection Braga,AMP2008London,130,AMP2008Londonwrote a review May 2022,"The building is full of character with stone walls and lovely courtyards in some areas.The location of the hotel is great for exploring Braga - nothing is too far except for the Bom Jesus do Monte which is a drive out of town anyway (or 45 min walk). The room we had was enormous, if a bit dark in decor, and was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable.The staff were all very pleasant. We were given a good recommendation for a meal in town, and when we pointed things running out/low at breakfast they sorted it quickly and found us to tell us they had been replenished.We felt it was over-priced.Considering the large size of the bedroom, the bathroom was small.Breakfast buffet OK but nothing stand out - e.g. jam selection poor, powdered scrambled egg, some of the fruit was tinned, not fresh.Wifi in the room was almost non-existent.It was a little dark in the room",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,LoveTravel594689,0,LoveTravel594689wrote a review Oct 2022,"Very nice hotel and facilities, pools were huge and always empty so had them to ourselves the whole time. We were sadly let down when the first day we went out and bought drink and food for our fridge and realised it was broken, and we were without hot water for 2 days as the boiler broke. Saying this though the staff were extremely friendly and helpful in trying to resolve these issues, and offered us a different apartment and free dinner for the rest of the time we were there. Even though it was very frustrating it was nobody’s fault and we appreciated how the staff dealt with it. I would stay here again for sure. Great value for money, the beach is walking distance and such a nice beach. We used our free dinner voucher and got steak and chips which was very nice! One thing we didn’t appreciate was on the second day the restaurant manager was questioning us about the vouchers as if we were lying about them, he should have just checked with the hotel staff as we had explained to him the situation, however his questioning and tone felt like he was accusing us of trying to steal a free meal.",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,cfmitchellumd,17,cfmitchellumdwrote a review Jul 2013,"Just came back from a 9 night stay at the Belmar Resort in Lagos, Portugal.  We had a 2 bedroom apartment with ample space and a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean.  We couldn't believe the size of our living space.  The rooftop terrace with lounge chairs, dining table, and view was spectacular.The entire resort was clean with 3 pools to choose from.  While the staff was very friendly and accommodating, I would say this was more of a hands off approach.  Felt as though this was an apartment we owned with a restaurant and spa on the property.  This is a good thing in my opinion.  The cleaners were excellent and came 2-3 times throughout our stay tidying up the apartment.  The restaurant was affordable and food was good.  I opted for a spa massage which I enjoyed.The resort was very comfortable, and there was always chairs available at the pool.  The pictures represented on trip advisor are accurate.  We were minutes from the local beach, as well as less than 5 minutes drive to some of the other beautiful beaches in Lagos.I would absolutely return to this resort, and think Lagos is a fantastic place to spend a holiday in the Algarve, but don't tell too many people.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,4

WIFI excellent.Food choice was brilliant and good quality.Staff friendly and the whole place was spotless.Only negative for us were the lifts, we were on the 9 floor, great views but the lifts are too small for the hotel, a few times I decided to walk and still beat my partner and son to the top!Overall I would recommend it.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Gayle E,0,Gayle Ewrote a review Oct 2023,"I truly think Valverde was the most gracious hotel I’ve ever stayed in.  I traveled from Colorado, and met two of my goddaughters from France there.  The entire staff treated us as though we were the most important guests they’d ever had.  This was the first time to Lisbon for all three of us and the location couldn’t be more perfect for our short, three-day reunion.  And it just couldn’t be more comfortable and glamorous!The High Tea and Fado night in the courtyard were just a couple of the highlights.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,5
Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,ap2472016,0,ap2472016wrote a review Jun 2017,"We stayed for four nights in early June and the apartment was fantastic. The location is ideal for exploring the city - easy walking distance to most landmarks (only a couple of minutes from the river) and close to transport if you need to travel further afield.The apartment itself was spacious and spotless, and the service from all the staff is amazing - super helpful with advice on where to go and answering any requests via Whatsapp during your stay.I've only visited Porto once but I can't believe there would be anywhere better to stay!",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,ewankay,46,ewankaywrote a review Jul 2016,"Stayed here for 4 nights in July and overall had a good time.The room we had was a deluxe twin on the second floor which consisted of a bedroom with twin beds (have Europeans never heard of double beds?), lots of hanging and drawer space. A large livingroom area with a bed settee and another TV with UK channels as well Spanish, German etc. A decent sized well equipped kitchen with cooker, microwave, full size fridge / freezer and washing machine and well stocked cupboards with cups, glasses and dishes. The bathroom had a bath with overhead shower from mixer taps which was strong enough but took a bit of fiddling to get the right temperature. Air conditioning was in the bedroom and livingroom. There was also a balcony with a table, chairs and dryer. There is free wi-fi in the rooms and public areas and the signal strength was decent enough although died a bit near the pool.The room was impressive in it's size but let down by the grubby shower curtain and grouting in the bathroom, loose fittings on the door handles and well worn couch in the livingroom. Even the supplied towels in the bathroom were threadbare with holes in them. Maid service was each day except a Sunday.We never ate in the hotel so cannot comment on the food although a buffet breakfast is 9 Euros and the all inclusive option is offered at 30 Euros pp/day.We did hire pool towels which came to 10 Euros each for the 4 days so if you can take your own.With regards to the pool people did reserve beds (which there are not a lot of) and still not turn up to use them till late afternoon, contrary to hotel policy which was never enforced.TOP TIP: the doors to the pool do not open until 8am exactly so don't bother going there before then if you fancy bagging a bed. The main pools are 1.43 metres deep and not heated and there is a small kids plunge pool for babies and toddlers. I would suggest keeping an eye on younger kids in the bigger pools.The back of the pool area up the steps and furthest away from the hotel has the sun all day and the kids area and area nearest the pool bar doesn't get it until around midday which may inform your choice of bed. The pool itself has seen better days, as have many of the beds but overall for lying in the sun and having a dip it wasn't too bad, just watch your feet on the broken tiles in the pool.It's probably worth mentioning there is no toilets on the pool level and you have to go down stairs to the lower ground floor. There is a disabled toilet near to reception on the same level as the pool but the last time I was in there the floor was soaking and paper towels were scattered all over the floor with the bin overflowing so they are obviously not checked regularly.The restaurant looked clean but was never very busy are there are so many places to eat out and there are two convienience stores within a 2 minute walk to stock up your fridge for meals or snacks.The hotel bar had entertainment some nights but we never stayed and was never very busy, almost 12 Euros for a vodka / coke and a pint of Magners, which they have on draft. The poolside bar was almost exactly the same price for two plastic cups of shandy and two tiny tubs of ice cream so 5 star prices at least.As I said at the beginning it was a decent holiday overall, the hotel is in a quiet area, staff were very friendly and helpful, it is located about 15 minutes from the Old Town and 10 minutes from the strip. The small train stops outside the hotel and during the day the hotel puts a free bus on to both areas running every 15 minutes so not all bad.The hotel could do with room upgrades to justify its 5 star status and prices but in the public areas it looked impressive enough.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4

Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,FJUDD,9,FJUDDwrote a review Sep 2017,"Upon booking the apartment we recived an email asking us if we needed breakfast provisions, tours booked or to be collected from the airport, and another nearer the date of our travel for the final arrangements.We arrived and were greeted by Barbara (one of the team) who talked us through all the things we could do and see during our stay.  She helpfully booked a tour of the Douro wine region which was terrific.  I has asked for some specific items for breakfast which was helpfully provided, and there was a linen bag of fresh bread & croissants delivered to the apartment door each morning - just lovely.  The team set up a WhatsApp group so that we could easily contact them during our stay if we needed anything.   We sent a message to ask if they could recommend and possibly make a reservation for dinner on Saturday night. They responded immediately asking what type of restaurant - casual, fancy, and then found us a booking at a local restaurant which was superb.  Checking out was easy and again more help in recommendations for what we might like to do on our last day.The location is very central and perfect for walking around to see everything.  Close to the river front but also not to far from the main shopping area,  The quality of the accommodation is also very high.  Beautifully decorated throughout and very powerful shower.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,5
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Michael M,29,Michael Mwrote a review Jan 2015,"My wife and I have stayed at the hotel many times and you are always welcomed back with open arms, it is like home from home. As always the staff were exceptional as was the service and the food. The Sea food buffet has to be the best in the Algarve. The hotel has had a partial refurbishment which has not yet fully been completed but has been very tastefully done. My wife and I stayed for 7 days taking in the New Year Eve Gala which did not let you down as much quality food as one could eat and as much free wine as one could drink. We have been to many hotels through out the world and the Dona Filipa is special and is without a doubt our favourite hotel in the world yes that is correct the world and we have visited Dubai,Las Vegas, Australia, Italy and Spain staying in some fantastic hotels but leaving all with a small well if they had done this or of they had improved here, but you leave the Dona Filipa with the question where was there a fault? and our answer is there was none, quality all round. Yes there were 2 large parties in during our visit all over 40 years old most over 60 years old and they all played golf and in our opinion they added to the atmosphere. You will be hard pressed to find a better hotel and if you do then please let me know",Jan,2015,Jan 2015,2015-01-01,2015,4

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",77kati72,49,77kati72wrote a review Jan 2024,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, the hotel is always good, but I have to point out a few negative points that other travelers have also felt:The carpets in the hallways urgently need to be replaced, the stains are not really 5 star like..More restaurants urgently need to be opened during peak times, people who pay €200-300 for suites and have to walk 1 km to the next restaurant for breakfast and then have to wait on the stairs - are angry and don't come back...If the O Grill at the Pine Cliffs Residence were open, a lot would be better...Small children and babies in strollers should no longer be allowed into the hotel bar in the evenings, where alcohol is served, and pool tables are not a playground for 3-year-old children!!If the hotel staff see something like this, the parents should be told that this is not allowed...It's also difficult for adults at Christmas who want a quiet restaurant to eat in!!!This is not meant as a complaint, but rather as a suggestion for improvement.Nevertheless, I felt comfortable and will come back.",Jan,2024,Jan 2024,2024-01-01,2024,3

Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,St_Regis_AD,2,St_Regis_ADwrote a review Jul 2012,"I've stayed at both the the Lagos and the Sagres camp and they are both excellent hostels. The staff makes you feel like family from day one. They are super helpful, polite and fun. The houses are clean and well taken care of. Lagos is bigger and presents more options when it comes to going out and nightlife. Sagres, on the other hand, is more laid-back. So it depends what you like.....I went for the first time in the summer 2011. I planned on staying a week and ended up staying three weeks long. I had never surfed before so I took  several classes and ended up with a pretty good basis. The surf lessons are of very  high quality and very professional. You get a lot of personal attention and the instructors are highly motivated to take you to that 'next level'. I went back this spring and i'm planning on going again in Oktober. All in all it's always been a very complete experience for me. Great hostel, staff, people, food, culture, beach, surf.... It's a no brainer.",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,5
Four Seasons Fairways,Gburns1,43,Gburns1wrote a review Apr 2015,"We visited the Four Seasons in April for a week family holiday, in a group of 10 people including all ages. Booking was straight forward with the sales staff in the office very helpful and accommodating with them advising us to the best accommodation to suit our needs / party. Straight from arrival we felt very comfortable, in a pleasant and safe environment-perfect for young families. The resort is in an upmarket location, with access to the beach and shops alike. Prices are fair, and the food is of a good standard also. For what we paid for a three bedroom villa we were very happy with our stay, and Fairways will definitely be on a shortlist for next years family holiday. Please note, if you don't play golf you will wish you did by the time you have seen the wonderful courses - superb aesthetically. Now let me go and find some golf lessons online....",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,rharris333,3,rharris333wrote a review Jul 2009,"My mother and I stayed at the Marriott in Lisbon on 20 July 2009.  We were lucky enough to find a parking spot in front of the hotel so didn't have to pay the 20 euro for the parking garage.  During check-in, we asked for a complimentary upgrade and were told they would be happy to give us one for 45 euro, and that would include breakfast and internet.  When I pointed out we already had breakfast included, so 45 euro for internet seemed a bit much, the representative huffed a little and basically said take it or leave it.  We left it.  When we asked about the subway, he told us he didn't know anything about the local area, so we would need to speak to the concierge, which was fine, but it was all about the attitude.  We stepped over to the concierge desk to inquire about hop on hop off tours, subway and local restaurants and he handed us a couple of maps and couldn't get rid of us soon enough.  I was really put off by the employee attitudes.  We got to our room, which was very nice, although the mini-fridge didn't work very well.  We looked at the room service menu which seemed to be reasonably priced for a hotel, and found a couple of things that looked really good.  We then went down to the restaurant and found similar items, but not the same.  When we asked if we could order the beef fillet listed in the room service menu, the waiter literally grabbed our menus (with a smile, at least), and told us they couldn't accomodate us, so we needed to go back to the room to order from there.  It was actually kind of funny at how quickly he ushered us out of the restaurant, all the while making sure we knew how to dial room service.  The food came quickly, which was nice, and it was o.k.  No free internet in the lobby for laptops which was kind of surprising.  Beds were comfy, though and the room was nice.  Breakfast was the best we had all week...omelette's made to order and all the other standards.  If the employees would have tried even a little to be more friendly, it would have been a great stay.",Jul,2009,Jul 2009,2009-07-01,2009,2

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,bento2744,50,bento2744wrote a review Oct 2011,"As a loyal Marriott Reward Member, I selected this property post-cruise for 3 days. I arrived at the hotel 0930, expecting to have access to my room around 3pm which is standard, but was checked into the room without delay. It was 10 euro from the dock to the hotel instead of 19 euro pp by cruise ship transfer. The hotel offered UG for 45 euro per day which included daily breakfast and access to Executive Lounge on the 17th floor, our room was on the 16th, so it suited us fine. Everyone was very accommodating, but I did not find the staff at concierge desk to be too personable, I think it was mentioned by several reviews, when I chose this property. I booked this hotel 3 months prior to our arrival, \"book and buy\" rate of 95 euro per night, which was a great rate. It is located far from the city center, but fortunately taxi is very reasonable and we used it often to navigate the city. In fact, hired a taxi for 4 hours  day trip up to Sintra , Cascais and Estoril for 100 euro. The breakfast buffet was great in all respect, but dinner menu was pricey, typical prices you see at major chains.",Oct,2011,Oct 2011,2011-10-01,2011,4
Quinta do Furão,Kate-B_Nottingham,29,Kate-B_Nottinghamwrote a review Oct 2017,"We stayed here for three nights in October while on a 7 day/night walking holiday.  It was definitely our favourite hotel of the three we stayed at and I'm so glad we had the longest stay here.  It's location is stunning, we had a view overlooking the cliffs and sea to one side and the mountains on the other.  The bedroom was clean and well equipped with a little balcony we could sit on in the mornings/evenings.  The breakfasts were super, never had a better one anywhere else I've stayed (and I have travelled extensively for work over the past 25 years so that's saying something!).  A choice of 3 or 4 freshly made fruit juices every morning with unusual, exotic ingredients (e.g. passion fruit and pear), a multitude of cold meats, cheeses, salads, home made breads, cakes, yoghurts, bacon, sausages .... I could go on and on!  Also, a lovely guy who stands outside every morning to cook up fresh omelettes or fried eggs for you.  We were on half board so had an included 3 course meal in the main restaurant each night.  The menu choice changed each evening and we had some well cooked and tasty meals each time.  Other facilties are a small swimming pool for cooling off after a hard day's walking, plus a Jacuzzi to ease the aching calf muscles!  The grounds are extensive and there is access to a wonderful walk along the coast to Sao Jorge straight from the front door.  All the staff we spoke to were lovely, very friendly.  Special mention to Jose in the restaurant (there are two of them and both lovely) and the lady in the breakfast room in the mornings.  I would definitely swing by this hotel again if I ever make it back to Madeira in the future.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,5

Saccharum,Amy W,47,Amy Wwrote a review Oct 2020,"This hotel was honestly amazing and one of the best we have stayed at. Clearly the design of the hotel has been very well throughout as everything was just perfect. We had a sea view room and the view was incredible. We could have sat there all day looking at the ocean! The rooms were very clean, comfortable and modern. They were also cleaned every day. It was also great to have a decent and powerful hairdryer in the room! The infinity pool was fantastic and also loads of sun beds available. We also used the spa and had the Alambique massage, again great. The food at breakfast was very good and the service was equally matched.In terms of improvements, the WiFi in our room was very poor. It cut out if we weren’t practically next to the door so we ended up on 4G most of the time. This needs to be improved as I felt it was the only negative point!There is also parking available. We used the underground car park which was very secure and a lift takes you up to directly to your floor.We were only b&b so ate out at restaurants in Calheta, there was plenty of choice. Found the location very accessible, drove most of the island on our week stay.We would 100% go back to this hotel and did not want to leave! It was a welcome escape. Everything also felt extremely Covid safe, there was plenty of sanitizer everywhere in the hotel and the changes they have implemented worked well.Thank you for a fabulous stay!!",Oct,2020,Oct 2020,2020-10-01,2020,5

Not only was this fulfilled, but they even made a point of putting us in the same room.As last time resort was spotless. Staff very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. Stayed in pool view 2 bed which was very well equipped and spacious. Plenty of good supermarkets nearby, but you will need a car. Also of note is a very good gym. Only negative criticism is that since last time happy hour has moved from pool bar to other bar.  Was much nicer before when in pool bar.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,TheBurgers,466,TheBurgerswrote a review Nov 2017,"We stayed here for long weekend (3 nights) in October and had a good time. We had stayed here back in 2011 and the hotel continues to generally achieve the same standards although there were a few exceptions.In summary, its well located for the marina - easy enough to walk there in less than 10mins but far enough away to be out of the hustle and bustle. Its also very convenient to exit the rear of the hotel and be on the beach in 2 - 3 mins. The pool area is lovely, it's a big pool and was never busy enough that we struggled to get a sun lounger. As others have mentioned, the loungers and cushions have seen better days and many need replacing.The rooms are very nice, spacious enough with a huge bed and well decorated bathroom (fab shower).There is a TV is that's your thing (but you should really be out in the sunshine !) and they show a couple of BBC channels.In my opinion, breakfast seems better organised than when we were here previously and there are plenty of choices of hot & cold food as well as omelettes cooked to order. A particular mention to Bruno who was fab at breakfast and made a point of getting boiling water for our teas rather than the lukewarm version that we were initially offered. We didn't have dinner in the hotel preferring to wander to the marina - I can recommend Akvavit & Don Alfonso (very good) and A Broa (good) for dinner.The hotel provides free access to WiFi and the signal is good throughout the hotel.On the downside, the service wasn't great on a couple of occasions when trying to get served around the pool (it was fine at reception / breakfast). We had to go and find someone and had to wait long periods. Equally, one day we ordered two milkshakes and I can honestly say they were the worse I have even had ...and we were charged £9 for the privilege ! This leads me to the cost of drinks from the bar. The cost of a G&T & Blood Mary (ordered during happy hour) as well as two coffees and ports came to £50 - its easy to see why the bar area was more or less empty on the three evenings we were staying. Finally, bizarrely there is a charge if you want to use the indoor pool - strangely enough I never saw anyone using it so it seems self-defeating.So, a nice hotel and whilst I would be happy to stay there again I would avoid drinking at the bar.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,4

We had a second floor room that was at the corner so pool and street view,the balcony was dirty on arrival with hairs and cobwebs and wasn't cleaned once throughout our stay,the kitchen was basic had what you needed but the fridge was dirty,rusted and had a bad smell coming from it, the bathroom was horrible with cracks in the tiles that were dirty and the cleaners seemed to just moved things about in the bathroom instead of cleaning it. The pool area was clean and there was always beds however different groups of people that were staying in the hotel made our experience uncomfortable by constantly splashing and taking over the pool.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Joe H,1,Joe Hwrote a review May 2024,"I've stayed in numerous 4* and 5* hotels, and this is not one of them.I went with 3 friends and we booked 2 rooms all inclusive. When we checked in, it seemed like the most dismal and tired hotel I've ever been in. To make matters worse, they have a picture of the MGM group's founder everywhere, I wasn't sure whether we'd just been inducted into to a cult.RoomsAnyway, it turned out we were put in K block, which is a good 5-10 minute walk away from the beach and pools. As you walk towards the block it states luxury block (or rooms, my memory fails me) but this must clearly be a joke as they are anything but.The rooms were gross. The bathroom was tiny, flush didn't work properly, barely any light in there and no windows to open? Beds were so uncomfortable and maids either wanted to do a quick clean at 8am or 6pm when we were in the room!Our room was outside a busy walkthrough to the 'strip' which was incredibly loud during the night.Food and drinkThis was incredibly disappointing. Breakfast lunch and dinner were all awful. The bars had terrible opening times and everything was served in tiny plastic cups. We only ate there the first night and ate out for every other meal as we couldn't stomach it.Constant queues for the bars, and the guy in the kebab stall was the slowest person I have ever watched working. It was painful and they were average at best. I had a pork taco ok the first day but this was just a pork FAT taco and inedible. Almost laughable how bad they were.FacilitiesOnly 2 pools but this hotel must have in excess of 500 rooms. Unless you were at the pool for 7am there was no chance of getting a sunbed.Hotel entertainment is never my thing so I couldn't possibly comment on this.LocationGreat location, so close to the beach and lots of nice restaurants and bars. Our favourite was the beach club just outside the hotel, treat food and drink and a great atmosphere.VerdictThis screams of an over-starred 3* hotel that would need a significant investment to get anywhere near to a 4* hotelWould do everything in my power to never return to any hotel by this brand. So poor.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,1

The average - breakfast was more than acceptable. The rooms are small but modern. The bad - the air conditioning in 2 of the rooms did not work. According to the staff the air conditioning is inadequate in many of the rooms. This could be a nice hotel, but the inability to get the room cool enough to sleep in means that you should probably select another location.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,2

He picked us out a lovely local restaurant down in the town where we, meaning I, could watch my team lose at the football whilst we chowed down hearty plates of regional food surrounded by lots of locals.The building itself is an old wooden thing out of a fairy tale and the included breakfast did the job.A B&B place best suited for visitors with cars and stuck on a wooded road that leads up to many of the town's sights.Highly romantic and very recommend!",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,5

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Bea,19,Beawrote a review Jun 2025,"I will start with the positives. The hotel is in a great location for visiting Tavira, a few minutes walk from the bars, restaurants and shops. The river is nearby from where you can catch the ferry to the beach at Tavira Island for 2.50 euros return. The indoor market is close by along with the nature reserve and salt pans where you can see flamingos and other birds.The reception area is large and the staff are pleasant and helpful. We found the bar food and drinks reasonably priced for a hotel.The bed was comfortable.There are activities around the pool eg aqua aerobics, petanque, quiz ,bingo, table tennis etc it is not noisy around the pool and there are no sunbed wars which is a huge bonus.The negatives are low quality breakfast cereal and juice; the same breakfast every day there was never any variation. We were bed and breakfast so can't comment on the evening meal. Bar snacks were not offered with drinks.The bathroom had low quality toilet roll, the storage wasn't sufficient, instead of bedside tables, drawers would be better. We paid for a pool view room but the balcony was a solid wall so, when seated, we could only see the rooms opposite not the pool.A bottle of water was provided on arrival but was never replaced. Tea bags and milk were also never replenished and despite raising this on an almost daily basis it didn't change. The lead for the kettle wasn't long enough so we had to move it onto the floor.However, the biggest problem was pigeons. They are everywhere; we even had one nesting with eggs on our balcony. They use the swimming pool as a drinking station and are not phased by people in the pool. There is pigeon poo everywhere. The staff do try and keep on top of the cleaning but it seems like they are fighting a losing battle. I spoke to the manager and she acknowledged it is a big problem. They have tried various remedies to no avail.Despite all of this I probably would go back and I don't think it would take much to put some of the problems right but if you don't like pigeons it may not be for you.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,4

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Lisa D,2,Lisa Dwrote a review Jul 2024,"Just got back from a 4 day stay with my 2  children. Fantastic location and lovely hotel.The pool- was so quiet, and some mornings we practically had the pool to ourselves. Plenty of sun beds, no one reserved them. Which was so nice to see. The pool never really got busy until the afternoon.Restaurant - breakfast, the options  very plentiful and never once had to queue. Fresh pancakes every morning were a hit with my children. The restaurant was always pretty empty. My only complaint is it is a little dark and with no air con.Dinner - the staff were very friendly, the waiter always remembered our drinks order without even asking. There were plenty of options and we found plenty to eat every day.Rooms - were spot on, spacious, with a decent size bathroom with a good shower. Beds were quite comfy. Also cleaned daily. We stayed on the 3rd floor and I read a  lot of negative reviews about the pigeons, we had no problems what so ever. We could sit on the balcony no problem. I also donâ€™t think pigeons in general are a problem for the hotel. Yes there were some flying around but I barely noticed them.Entertainment - was pretty poor, not much going on in my the day and the evening entertainment was pretty non existent apart from a Portuguese show on a Monday night  and some singers on Friday/saturday night.  We arenâ€™t bothered by the entertainment as we prefer to go out in the evening.Pool side snack bar- although very slow to serve. The food was tasty, with burgers, toasties and sandwiches. The bar in the evening was dead and I think if there was better entertainment options then more people would use the bar in the evening. Also no air con. Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been away at the height of season and seen an empty bar every night. The outside seating area could be utilised more in the evening with better lighting.Location- was perfect, lots of restaurants and shops on your doorstep.Would definitely come back to Tavira and this hotel.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,4

I loved the room that I was assigned to, it was very spacious and even had a bath tub in the bathroom. Surrounding the hotel, there were many Turkish and Asian foods available.

Canto de Luz,LuggageWithWheels,33,LuggageWithWheelswrote a review Aug 2014,"We had the house to ourselves so we were able to spend lots of time with Brigitte and her assistant, Esther. Sadly, we were not able to meet Brigitteâ€™s husband, Andre, as he was traveling during our visit. If you appreciate modern architecture and building restoration, you will be fascinated with what the owners have created out of an old ruin of a building. It is ultra modern and comfortable with every convenience, including an elevator, which is extremely useful if you have lots of luggage, as the house has many floors. There is a beautiful patio off the kitchen on which to enjoy the sun. Brigitte and Esther served fabulous breakfasts consisting of homemade jams, cakes and breads, Portuguese pastries and fresh squeezed juice and fruit. Brigitte speaks French and Portuguese and a little bit of English. Andre speaks French, English and Portuguese.  Be aware that because it is such an old building, there is no air conditioning; however, even if it is hot during the day (it was in the mid-90s when we visited), it cools down significantly at night, so it was not a problem. Try to get a room facing west over the garden so you can open the sliding doors and feel the breeze while hearing nothing but birds singing.  As we were the only guests, we were able to see all of the rooms. They are each unique in design, but they are all beautifully new, spacious and immaculately clean. We highly recommend itâ€”especially if you speak French or Portuguese. We used the GPS to locate the house from the Porto airport and had no trouble finding it. We arrived on a Friday afternoon and were lucky to find a parking space right outside and were able to leave the car there (free!) for the weekend while we explored Porto.

It is near Marques Pombal roundabout, however knowing in advance I would have booked a place closer to downtown..BUT - the breakfast is dreadful! For a 4* hotel this is a big NO.The range is limited, and the QUALITY is very POOR.Coffee tastes just like water, same for the juice, it is not even a juice, just some syrup mixed with water.

Glad we did.  Only about 10 minutes away by taxi.This is a big hotel and very well maintained, both inside and outside. There were 3 tour buses parked outside when we arrived.  It has all the amenities that you would expect from a large resort style hotel and is able to absorb lots of people without feeling overwhelmed.A grand foyer and check in was very gracious and efficient.  We were allocated room 413.  There are 2 elevators which are fast.Our room was wonderful. It's large, comfortable, has a large balcony facing east I think, so no afternoon sun and the ensuite is large as well.  There is nothing else we need.  The bed is comfortable and the whole complex is very quiet.Wifi is free and fast.  It's nicely furnished, has a/c (not that we used it) and a mini bar as well as a TV.  Bottled water is not complementary.We decided to have dinner in the restaurant on the first night, and of course it was dearer than in town, but the food and service was excellent and worth the money.A laundry service is available.  It's a same day service, reasonable cost and the clothes were well presented.The breakfast is held in the dining room and the adjacent room and is served buffet style.   Good quality food and plenty of choice and it's regularly replenished.The location of the hotel is excellent. Bordering on the old town and surrounded on 2 sides by the river, so just a walk to discover the lovely alleyways and good small restaurants and also close to a take off point to walk up to Convento do Cristo.We enjoyed our 3 nights at Hotel dos Tempários and feel it is excellent value.

It lacks in friendliness and attitude.",May,2019,May 2019,2019-05-01,2019,3

Casa Pinha,SBCompeta,5,SBCompetawrote a review Oct 2012,"We stayed here just for one night in May 2012, having found the hotel on a pet friendly hotel website.The romm was very well fitted out with comfortable twin beds, a small kitchen area with fridge, and other amenities. The room was very clean and spacious.The bar and restaurant was spotless and the food was very good value.The setting is spectacular with magnificent views over the bay, and woodland walks just outside the gates.Excellent value and well worth a detour.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,5
