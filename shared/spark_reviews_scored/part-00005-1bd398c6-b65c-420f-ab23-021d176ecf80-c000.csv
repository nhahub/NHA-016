Saccharum,dunclivvy,15,dunclivvywrote a review Sep 2015,"Beautiful hotel, with fantastic rooms, amazing pools and calm atmosphere.When we arrived they offered us 'an inside view', The room was lovely, but the view was awful. We paid for an upgrade to a sea view room and it was excellent. We were able to watch the amazing sun set sitting out on the balcony. Rooms are well equipped, with a small fridge, safe, hairdryer and reasonably sized TV. Very little noise could be heard from outside the room despite only being a few metres from the lift.People (unfortunately are still 'reserving' sun beds, but there really is no need as there are so many spread out all over the different pool areas of the hotel.We were staying on a B&B basis, so didn't have any evening meals in the hotel, but we did have a few lunched at the pool bars, which were fine. Breakfast was fine, with plenty of choice, but it did get quite busy at times.There's not much to do in the resort of Calheta, but again, the resort has a relaxed atmosphere. Great place to chill out, but don't expect a lively place. A handful of places to eat on the marina, and a couple of other restaurants close by. 'Beach' at the hotel is stony, and can be difficult to get into the sea without some 'Croc' type footwear.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,KateManchester_12,6,KateManchester_12wrote a review Jun 2024,"We stayed 1 week at the Jupiter Albufeira in early June. There are lots of pros so I don't want to slate the hotel - it is super clean and friendly. Staff are always helpful and the rooms are big and comfortable. The pool areas are clean and there is plenty there for kids above 5. We travelled with our 5 year old and 1 year old. Our 5 year old son loved the pool, the water park, the football pitch, and just generally enjoyed being there. However, the hotel didn't have anything on offer for our 1 year old. Evening meal times were from 6.30 pm and our 1 year old sleeps at 7 so that meant our dinner times were quite rushed and both kids were pretty grumpy by that point. It also meant that we couldn't make use of the bookable restaurants as they also opened at 6.30 and because it would require ordering off a menu, there would be more of a wait. I understand kids could stay up later on holiday of course, but ours are just too young and just get too grouchy if they stay up too late. That also meant that we missed the evening entertainment - partly because it was a bit out of the way of the hotel. The kids club looked great but our 5 year old wasn't interested. We did notice that there was some soft play equipment in there - this would have been fantastic for our 1 year old! I think the hotel could benefit from a small play area for toddlers/under 3s. All this would require is a small space indoors/outdoors with some smaller play equipment and softer play equipment. There was just nothing at all for our toddler.Overall - we enjoyed our week. And I suspect the hotel is just better enjoyed if your kids are over 5 or so. But not for toddlers.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Sra. Ka,57,Sra. Kawrote a review Dec 2015,"Belmar Spa & Beach Resort was a lovely surprise close to the beach. We did not use the hotel facilities as we spent most of the time away during the day, visiting the gorgeous coast around. But we, indeed, enjoyed our spacious and comfortable two-bedroom townhouse with balcony room. Very nice kitchen and living room. We really felt like home. We did not rent a car - we used cab all the time, but I would recommend to rent a car as it is easy to drive around and it is very hot/dry during summer to walk long distances. The hotel has a central restaurant to have your meal or you can order to have it at your privacy/room. Nearby restaurants have delivery service as well if you need. In downtown Lagos you find several options and it is 5/10 minutes by taxi. Lagos is a very special place and I would recommend Belmar hotel to enjoy your vacation.",Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Sinek7,56,Sinek7wrote a review Apr 2025,"When I saw the pictures of the hotel online I could not unseen it. Had to book it and experience it...and it did not disappointed. We stayed at Tivoli for 8 nights. At the time of booking there was no ocean view room available for the whole stay so we decided to change rooms when the one we wanted was free. The move was very smooth.Both rooms where very good size and clean. The ocean view was amazing. From our room, restaurant and the roof top bar. Pool was clean and not too busy despite the high season. We were always able to find a sunbed. Breakfast buffet had a good selection of food to choose from. Food at the restaurants was delicious.  Can say anything bad... but what truly made our stay were the members of staff. Can't remember the last time we felt so comfortable in the hotelLovely and smiley men at the door always welcoming us with a smile. Absolutely fantastic team at the diner service. Massive thank you to you all.We would love to return to Tivoli Carvoeiro again.",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,ginle0,0,ginle0wrote a review Sep 2017,"We stayed at this spacious two bedroom apartment with a rooftop terrace for three nights. Ample parking is available. The grounds were lovely. The views from the pool were beautiful, but the temperature of the pool was extremely cold making swimming almost impossible. No poolside drink service, although there is an outdoor bar present.Our kitchen was well equipped to prepare meals. There was a lovely patio on the ground level with two chairs and a table in which to enjoy a drink outside. There was a washing machine and a drying rack outside on the patio. The roof top terrace had a table and chairs, but only two loungers for four people. No cushions for the loungers.Housekeeping came every day. The apartment was clean, although the staircase leading to the rooftop was never swept, and I know this because of the large dead insect that was there the entire time. Our shower did leak onto the washroom floor, requiring the use of extra towels to absorb the water.. Our apartment also had a problem with ants. Many ants! On the main level and in the bedrooms. Insecticide was applied three times before we were able to enjoy an insect fee apartment. We were told the whole area is having a problem with ants. It might be helpful to remove the shag carpets from the bedroom and living room areas.The beds were very comfortable. There were only two small pillows. Extra pillows would have been nice.The beach is a short walk away with a nice outdoor restaurant. There is also a bus stop at the beach. The main town area is a short drive away with cafes, street vendors, restaurants, and grocery stores.There is a great restaurant by the water in town with a great rooftop view and a delicious buffet. Be careful walking on the cobblestone sidewalks, as it can be a trip hazard. Wear comfortable shoes.The hotel restaurant is average. We ordered well done steaks which came to us rare, and had to be returned. The shrimp dish was delicious.The sangria was great. The music entertainment was not so good.The reception desk staff was very polite and helpful. We received immediate assistance when our A/C was not working.I would return to this resort.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,2
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Robert M,19,Robert Mwrote a review Apr 2023,"We stayed at the Jupiter Hotel Albufeira for a week in April (today is our final full day as of writing).I hope this is a comprehensive/balanced review of a fantastic hotel.Location:+ Situated in a primarily residential area with just an Irish pub adjacent - very quiet, well kept area.+ The entire hotel feels private and enclosed with tall bushes/walls.- The hotel is about a 35/40 minute walk from Albufeira Old Town (~2 mile) however there's a free shuttle bus (make sure to queue early for it!) that can take you here. Uber is widely available in Albufeira and costs about €4 to/from hotel to Old Town which is very cheap!Accommodation:+ Two days prior to arriving, I emailed to ask if we could have a room that was on a higher floor as our son is a very light sleeper - we received a reply almost immediately and were given a room on the top floor (room 1044) on arrival.+ The Classic Family room was very spacious with two single beds together and a double sofa bed for our son.+ The room was absolutely spotless and modern - zero complaints whatsoever.+ The rooms seem to be very sound insulated as we couldn't hear anything from the rooms either side of us.+ Our room was pool facing but with the balcony door closed and being on the top floor of the hotel, the sound is very low.- My only criticism of our particular room is that it was above the area where the kids disco and entertainment is which goes on to 10pm and the speakers are incredibly loud. Next time I would get a room on the top floor but the opposite side of the hotel.Atmosphere:+ The hotel has a very lively, uplifting atmosphere. The numerous kids' entertainers and general staff are very pleasant - haven't had any negative experiences with staff at all.+ During the day, there is music playing at the poolside and different activities such as aqua Zumba which seemed to be popular.+ Despite being very busy while we stayed, there was never a time where I felt overwhelmed or claustrophobic - even at peak meal times.+ As stated before, the location of the hotel in a residential area is great also as there's no loud music or noise from outside of the grounds.+ At the side of the hotel there is a quiet pool which has a very chill vibe.Service:+ The level of service at this hotel is incredible - from the reception staff to the waiting staff to the cleaners.+ At meal times, used plates and cutlery are cleared very quickly (but not in a pushy way). Staff are always available to ask for another drink.+ Bar staff at the pool bar are very friendly.+ We had an issue with a slight leak from the shower which, within 5 minutes of reporting, someone from maintenance had arrived and checked the issue. Housekeeping cleaned up while we had dinner and it was as if nothing happened!Food & Drink:+ The food quality and options available are fantastic - really diverse choice of food each day.+ Breakfast time usually had the same, large selection of cold foods and hot foods such as eggs, bacon, hash browns etc however lunch and dinner was more diverse with different options each day.+ Each evening there was a different food theme (Arabic, American, French, Surf & Turf, Portuguese etc) which was nice. Quality of the food was impressive.+ There is an Italian section where there's freshly baked pizza and a selection of different pastas. You can also get your own custom pasta plate made up with whatever ingredients you want.+ There's two other restaurants - one A La Carte (wasn't overly impressed with it) and an All You Can Eat meat one which was lovely. Depending on your package, you should get one free dinner in each of these.+ There is practically food available throughout the day - be it the main buffet area or the small snack shack that has sandwiches, crisps, ice cream etc.+ The drink selection is extensive and there are no limits to how much you can drink.- My only criticism of the food is that it's not the warmest at times - even if you arrive for the beginning of dinner time (7pm).Activities:+ This hotel is very much family focused and there are a lot of activities for kids such as a kids club where they do crafts, different games around the hotel during the day, two play parks (one that has water) and big water slides. There's also an artificial football pitch which is well maintained.+ In the evening, there is a kids disco in a marquee at the side of the hotel with music, popcorn, candy floss and even different birds of prey/tropical birds one evening!+ The hotel also offers access to different tours and attractions such as Zoomarine but we didn't go this time.- The pools are VERY cold so prepare yourself for this. Once you've got in the pool and used to it, it's fine.Value for Money:+ This hotel is the definition of value for money - the peace of mind of not having to worry about going somewhere else for lunch or drinks and everything at your disposal is fantastic.+ I've travelled around the world - Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, USA - this is the nicest, cleanest, friendliest hotel I've stayed in up to now.Comments in relation to points from other reviewers:+ The carpets in the halls are spotless and I seen them being cleaned on a couple of occasions - not sure what the issue is with these.+ The lifts are well organised and even with staying on the top floor, we never had to wait longer than a few minutes for one.Overall - this hotel is fantastic with a high quality finish, friendly staff, quality choice of food and drink and the perfect location for a family holiday.We have never stayed someone twice but will definitely be back here next year!!!",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,4
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Teeandtee,50,Teeandteewrote a review Oct 2018,"As a boutique city hotel, we can't praise Valverde enough. The location is great; the interiors are beautiful, as is the external courtyard space complete with feature pool; the food is very good - but most of all, the team there is absolutely amazing. From our initial enquiry facilitated by the highly professional Tomas, through to check in; recommendations on restaurants and sight seeing attractions (thank you to Tomas again, Reubin and others); delicious breakfasts; top notch bar service and every other element of our Valverde experience, our stay there could not have been bettered. The hotel is currently in the midst of an expansion - we wish them well and can't wait to see the newly remodelled version, but we do hope that the qualities that make Valverde so special will live on. Well done team and thank you all!",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,j2OLover,1,j2OLoverwrote a review Aug 2025,"Family of 12 staying here for our summer holiday. 4 apartments between us and they are great! Biggest apartment we have ever had in a hotel, all are massive and much bigger than the pictures suggest. Clean and tidy with all the facilities you need - even a washing machine in the kitchen although we aren’t doing any laundry on holiday but great for a back up. The pool is large and lovely, great temperature and salt water isn’t too salty you can hardly tell. Sunbeds are all comfy and the pool opens 9-8 so you have time to get up and get a bed without a mad dash at 6am with towels. The kids love the pool area, entertainment with volley ball in the pool, darts and ping pong is good. The bar serves actual decent beer not the usual watered down rubbish. We are self catering but facilities for all inclusive look good. Beach is close as are loads of lovely restaurants. The staff can’t do enough for you and the apartment is cleaned well once a day which is ample. Can’t fault it. Would come back again definitely. We are only one week in but it’s lovely and can’t wait for the next week! We were a bit dubious at first as the rooms look slightly dated but you can’t tell it’s all part of the Portuguese charm, comfy beds, good power shower, air con is almost too good we have to turn it up so we don’t freeze which is a good thing! Sofa bed is comfy, really can’t fault it at all. We will definitely return. Arcade for the children, gym is great and well stocked for all workouts, bars are good in the complex and the interior of the hotel is lovely with fountains and statuettes. Brilliant 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,5

Breakfast is pancakes, breads & spreads. You can pay 8 euros for dinner which is hot & cold starter, main and dessert - absolutely great quality and quantity of food. Once we'd done it once we didn't eat anywhere else (apart from at the linked hostel 'sunset destination hostel which has a roof terrace and a little pool!). Staff were brilliant, really friendly and ready to chat. We went on one of the free walking tours which was great, and also a paid one to Sintra, as well as going to jazz night.

Captain's Log House,Konrad_Osa,0,Konrad_Osawrote a review Jul 2013,"It was my second stay at Captain’s. this time with full house. despite of that it was not crowded or uncomfortable, on the contrary, I felt like visiting an old friend's house.I was picked up from Peniche bus station and straight away went  surfing a nearby secret spot.I could talk a lot but will try to focus on most important aspects: - free breakfast, served each day by supernice staff;  free fruits and little chocolates available for guests; surf storage place; bikes that you can rent free of charge and explore nearby villages or simply checkout waves each morning (do not forget to lock the bike ;) and interesting people from all over the world that you can meet and party with.I hooked up with surf camp from Slovakia, which uses Captain’s as their base; it was great as I could improve my surf skills with Ben and Peter- the instructors. We had one barbecue party with 2 guys playing guitars, one guy playing watering can as drums, and few others singingJack Johnson “Old train to breakdown” which was quite epic...Visit Captain’s and you will not regret it!

It's not the type of place that we would normally look for or stay at but we certainly will in the future.  It's a great old building with very quirky décor.  The hotel rooms are not full of sleek marble and chrome or up to the minute gadgets (although there was an espresso machine) but we had a perfectly adequate bathroom, with a lovely big modern shower, and a very comfortable bed.  We were not troubled by any of the noise issues that other reviewers have mentioned, although I can imagine that this might be a problem at the weekends, particularly in the summer.  The breakfasts were great with a good selection and the ability to have eggs freshly cooked for you if you wanted them.  The lady on the breakfast service was lovely.

Saccharum,Stefan J,0,Stefan Jwrote a review Aug 2023,"We were at the Saccharum at the beginning of August 2023. We were very impressed. A very great hotel. Very clean rooms, very friendly staff, delicious food and above all a lot of choice. We particularly liked the live cooking. The infinity pool on the roof was a real highlight. Children are also very welcome here. In the Fly Lounge you can enjoy live music from various artists every evening while enjoying delicious cocktails. The Fly Lounge offers a great ambience on the 8th floor of the hotel. The cocktails are also excellent, by the way. The massage in the SPA area was also very relaxing.The only drawback: The hotel is very far outside of Funchal (about 45 minutes away). But it is absolutely wonderful to relax and escape the stress of everyday life. You can really switch off here.A big thank you to the Saccharum team. We had a great vacation and would definitely recommend the Saccharum.Best wishes from Germany,The Jost family",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4

Breakfast service was atrocious which given the good quality of the breakfast items was disappointing. Over priced and underwhelming buffet dinner. Generally staff pressured, hotel management would be better running a car wash as clearly the rest is too much for them. The service ethic of the past which is omni-present in the staff has been lost. The recent renovation is aesthetically pleasing and appropriately stylish but a clear lack of functional management and backing infrastructure has reduced the hospitality to a disappointing level. Absolutely not a 5 star.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",CharoATX,88,CharoATXwrote a review Jun 2023,"Reid’s was everything we hoped for. It’s gorgeous - the pictures don’t do it justice. The staff is terrific: thoughtful and patient front desk staff, fantastic servers, professional housekeeping, and the transportation team who picked us up and dropped us off at the airport. It's a very historic hotel, and you felt like you'd stepped back in time.Here’s what we loved:- The views are incredible!- The hotel is impeccable - flowers and tropical plants everywhere. We had beautiful Calla Lilies in a vase in our bathroom- The food and drinks are reasonably priced for a 5-star hotel - I recommend a Negroni!- The beds and sheets are incredibly comfortable- The staff pays attention to everyone- The breakfast buffet was one of the biggest I've ever seen and had loads of fresh fruit like papaya, mango, passionfruit- We received an upgrade to a suite, and it was huge and felt very luxurious- No mysterious ambient electronic/mechanical sounds in the hotel you so often experience in large American hotels (usually the A/C or elevators)- No TVs in the lounge or bar areas! (they have public rooms with TVs that some guests used to watch a football/soccer match) It was so lovely not to be bombarded with news or sports- The only music was a live pianist - no easy-listening Spotify playlists to endure- The canapes and nuts we received each evening while having a Negroni on the terraceI could go on and on! We were there during a big storm in Madeira that caused loads of flight cancellations, and you could tell the hotel staff was stressed having to deal with canceled reservations, questions from guests (including us), and folks who left for the airport and then had to return (also us). They handled it like pros, and when our flight was inevitably canceled, they welcomed us back to the hotel to remain for the day until our rebooked flight ten hours later.The only negative was a group of guests who arrived a few days into our stay and proceeded to FaceTime their friends from the bar area (they'd all had a few drinks - no judgment,  but it made them a lot louder). The recent acceptance of having to endure someone’s loud FaceTime or phone call (or game or videos…) in a public place is a major pet peeve of mine, and while these paying guests had as much right to be there as I did, I would’ve loved it if a manager had politely asked them to take their call outside. It’s a historic 5-star hotel with a dress code for Afternoon Tea and dinner. Why not ban loud phone calls, too?All of the other guests were lovely and respectful. We can’t wait to go back!",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,4

Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,Geprig,7,Geprigwrote a review Jan 2018,At first I thought this hotel might be a bit out of the way but when I stood on the terrace looking out on a wonderful sunrise over the Atlantic I was happy I choose this hotel. There are plenty of great resturants within a 10 minute ride and there's a shuttle bus to Ponta Delgada. And that's much less important than the fact the hotel is very comfortable and the staff are endlessly helpful. A number of people have commented on the glass partition between the bathroom and the bedroom. All I can say is 'when the view is this good why miss out?' And I forgot to mention the  beach with natural swimming pools.,Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,5

Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,Mnmurphy1002,11,Mnmurphy1002wrote a review Jul 2019,"New modern hotel. Overall we were very happy with it. We liked where it is located on the north side of the island. Seemed centrally located to everything. It’s in the quiet country more then a busy city. You definitely need a car out here. Don’t rely on taxis. Large parking lot with plenty of spaces.The pool area is picturesque. Nice infinity pool overlooking the ocean. Although I would recommend more/better shade options. The huts they have are old and worn out. Barely provide any shade.The rooms are clean and modern. Beds are super comfy. They provide some drinks and a couple snacks in the mini fridge. We loved the robes they provided. They also provide toiletries. All you need to bring is a toothbrush and tooth paste. They provided body soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. A safe is provided for your valuables. We had a room facing the mountains, and at first I was bummed out we didn’t have an ocean view.  But in the end I was glad we had the Mountain View. It was quiet/more private  compared to the pool side. They do not have irons in the room which was strange to me. Every hotel I have been in had an iron and iron board. You think they would take into consideration that you just traveled here and your clothes may be wrinkly from the suitcase, but no big deal.The breakfast buffet in the morning was perfect for us as we traveled around the island all day. It was a good “get up and go” option. The food is basic but substantial for the purpose.Some negative aspects of the hotel and areas they needs improvement on are the bar and restaurant. Service is lacking. It seemed as though they all lacked experience and consideration of your time. They were best at not making eye contact and ignoring you. The only way we were served was by sitting at the bar. We came in for lunch one day and sat at the table with no menu for 15 minutes. We finally got up and sat at the bar. They seemed to always be in the weeds, and never had any structure. No one seems to work one specific area, they all just ran around to the outside, inside, bar, etc. drinks looked yummy, but took a lot of time and effort to make one.  To me they need a better manager and more help. The food is expensive and just ok. You can drive 4 minutes down the road and get way better food for a fraction of the price. I think we ate 3 times here at the hotel, and it was all out of desperation.In my opinion, the reason this is a four star hotel is because of the service/food at the bar and restaurant. Also, I believe this should be an adults only hotel. The pool area is so serene and quiet, but is ruined by a screaming/crying child. The acoustics in the restaurants and hallways are also not conducive to screaming children. We got a massage in the spa one morning and you could hear the kids screaming in the breakfast area and playroom which is located right across the hall from the spa.It is a very nice hotel, and we would stay here again. Staff is friendly and do try their best. I would just correct those few things that I mentioned, and then this actuallyMight be a 5 star hotel.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4

From the minute we arrived to the day we left all the staff were fantastic with a special mention for Telma and Valerie (reception) for whom no questions were too difficult or time consuming to answer, Juan (are you lost sir? private joke!) and Marcia in the pool bar. Also Miguel the hardworking and pleasant courtesy bus driver. In my opinion breakfast was first rate, plenty of choice with hot and cold options.The evening meals in the restaurant were excellent with both traditional and international food.We were lucky enough to have room 603 in the panoramic tower with fantastic views over the harbour and the city. The room itself was very spacious with lots of hanging space and storage. A fantastic bathroom with an excellent shower and plenty of hot water. The rooms were cleaned daily by the very professional housekeeping staff who were friendly and did a great job.

Eurostars Porto Douro,RJBHertfordshire,16,RJBHertfordshirewrote a review Sep 2017,We have just returned from a 3 night break in Porto.  The location of the hotel was perfect for us with sensational views over the river and especially from the newly opened roof terrace.  The terrace proved to be an additional bonus for viewing the Red Bull world air race over the river Douro.We were unaware that we had booked the weekend of the race which meant that road closures proved problematical at times.  However the Reception staff ( especially Fabio) dealt with all our queries in a very professional manner.  They volunteered to telephone all the tour operators and restaurants to re-arrange times or meeting places on our behalf. They even organised complimentary jugs of sangria on the roof terrace whilst we watched the aeroplanes racing.  The barman also gave us an impromptu tutorial on his preparation of all the different variations of gin!The rooms were comfortable and extremely clean with lovely soft pillows.  The restaurant provided an excellent breakfast to start the day.We had a really good city break in this delightful hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to Porto.,Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

The room was very creatively designed, with hidden cabinets and drawers, all in a very modern/clean style. The wall separating the bathroom from the bathroom was glass from floor to ceiling, which gave a nice cool impression. The hotel is located on the waterfront and next to no less than two busy roads and the train tracks, so it is not as calm as some may want. However, the sound insulation works well and allowed even a light sleeper like me to get a good night's rest. The great bed probably helped a lot in this regard, too.

Everything is high tech, fully automatic, light switches complicated to use, the tea/coffee maker as well. Curtains close only if you press the right button etc - all in all too modern for my personal taste. May be I am too \"old\" for a hotel which is full of technique from A to Z.
