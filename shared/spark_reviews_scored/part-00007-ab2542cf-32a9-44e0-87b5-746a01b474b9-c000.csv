Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,AJ A,41,AJ Awrote a review Sep 2017,"We had a great stay at this resort. We got a studio apartment room and were greeting by a nice bottle of sparkling wine, as it was our honeymoon. We could open our patio door and was right in front of one of the great pool areas that overlooked Praia De Porto De Mos (which is a 5 min walk away). It is a 5 minute drive/ 30 min walk to the main town of Lagos and the famous beach Praia Don Ana. The room itself was great. The bed was firm and comfortable. There is a non included breakfast buffet that has a nice selection of foods. Also the bar does a \"happy hour\" where cocktails are reduced in price. They have a spa that we did not utilize, but would have loved to if we had more time. Our room only had a shower/hair gel dispenser in their showers, so if you are looking for shampoo or conditioner, they weren't included. Overall a great stay! Would recommend highly!",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Flanagan S,12,Flanagan Swrote a review May 2015,"My wife and I stayed here mid May and had an amazing time. The people at the resort go out of their way to ensure you are looked after and in particular I have to thank Carlos as he really helped me book a fantastic surprise for my wife's birthday before we arrived, thank you. The resort literally has everything you would need and has an amazing beach on their door step that we missed as soon as we got home.The nearest supermarket is a 20 minute walk but on the beach there is a lovely bar / restaurant 'Campimar' where you can get a very reasonable snack / ice cream / coffee or meal any time of day.Would highly recommend Lagos & Belmar - definitely somewhere we will revisit in the future.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,5

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,PKS_Bos2n,30,PKS_Bos2nwrote a review Nov 2024,"We choose the Tivoli hotel for its beautiful location and I am very glad we did.  We had a sea view room which was simply amazing.  We fell asleep to the wonderful sound of the sea.The room was sizeable and well appointed.  The breakfast was absolutely delicious!i always read the negative reviews before booking and noticed comments that the room was too white (it was not, the decor really complemented the sea side location).  The other complaint was the food.  We did not have dinner, but found the breakfast, drinks and snacks at the bar to be very good.",Nov,2024,Nov 2024,2024-11-01,2024,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Johnny D,3,Johnny Dwrote a review Jun 2023,Excellent hotel and facilities. We went on a large family holiday in June 2023 and had a great time.The only downside is the evening’s entertainment for the kids. This can sometimes be a weak point.

PortoBay Serra Golf,expatinmadeira,101,expatinmadeirawrote a review Feb 2013,"escaped from Funchal for a night up in Santo da Serra for my wedding anniversary. first time staying at Serra Golf but it wont be the last. its a lovely country style little hotel with just 22 rooms and the staff are so so friendly and nice! it was the same girl who checked us in, took our food order, served us, got us drinks in the bar and its just such a friendly place.we only stayed one night, i wish it had been longer. we had dinner in the hotel itself. there are other options in the village and if we had stayed longer we might have ventured out. however the hotel restaurant was excellent and decently priced too. there is a set half board menu which i think was 21 euros, but i had the beef espetada and the wine list has some very nice wines and also some very well priced ones.breakfast was immense, much more than i imagined for a small hotel. we were embarrassed to walk in at 0950 when it finished at 10am but the minute we sat down everything was topped up again, good cooked breakfast and great fresh breads and fruit.rooms are recently refurbished, free wifi, large tv, mini bar, everything you need.didnt have time to play golf but its less than 10 minutes walk to the course, we went horse riding instead at quinta do riacho which was fantastic.we will definitely return, next time probably for two nights so we can play golf and go to the famous sunday market.",Feb,2013,Feb 2013,2013-02-01,2013,3
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Rebecca Page,2,Rebecca Pagewrote a review Aug 2019,"My partner and our 13 and 15 year old children have just returned from 9 days at this Hotel.I honestly cannot fault it. We used Yellow Fish transfers from the airport who were excellent. The Reception staff spoke English and were very polite and helpful at all times. Our apartment was large with twin bedroom with TV, Large living area with TV, bathroom with bath and shower and fully equipped kitchen including dishwasher and washing machine. It was clean and in good order. We faced the front of the hotel on the 3rd floor and had views to the sea and resort. Excellent location with 10 min walk to the new town or 15 to the old town. The nearest beach is less than a 10 min walk and is well worth a visit. There is also a train that stops outside the hotel. There is a children's game room with machines and ice hockey and pool table. Also a children's club room with supervised activities. The animation team were very good lots of activities arranged including table tennis, darts, water polo, yoga, water aerobics, boules, cocktail making and food demonstrations. Evening entertainment was inside the bar area and included dancers, magicians and a music quiz. If you are looking for full evening entertainment of children's disco etc then this Hotel isn't for you the entertainment is more traditional. This is the only hotel I have ever stayed at where you can still get beds around the pool after 10.30 in the morning. Guests don't tend to reserve beds at the crack of dawn. The pools are a lovely size and not too busy. The food and drinks are good but after 9 days can feel a bit the same but still good quality. The restaurant is very relaxed and we never had to queue for food.The hotel also has a Spa and large gym that hotel guests can use for free. Indoor pool (need a hat can buy there) hot tub,steam room and sauna. This is lovely when you want to chill out after a day sunbathing.All in all a fabulous experience and a hotel I would thoroughly recommend.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,5
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Will J,7,Will Jwrote a review Jul 2016,"My girlfriend and I have just come back from a 3 day break in Lisbon staying at Hotel Valverde. After a long visit to the UK seeing friends and family, this was a time for us to just relax and take in the sights and food of Lisbon.From the moment we arrived here we felt so welcome and were treated as though we were their most important guests. This set the tone for the rest of our stay here. We crashed on the first night after getting in at midnight and then the next day we had a delicious breakfast sitting in their courtyard. It was here that we started to ask questions about where to go and where to eat, and everyone could not have been more helpful. Giving their advice on what to do and not to do in such a way that it was like friends were helping you out. All the hotel stuff are so kind and friendly to us it really made such a huge difference to our short stay.They were happy to organise a tour for us that took us up to Sintra. We thought it was quite expensive, however, once we got up there it really made such a difference and allowed us to get to all the places without any stress whatsoever.As for the facilities, we stayed in the mini room and it was perfect for us! Little things like great air con and a great shower really made the difference.So overall we could not have been happier, and our stay was the perfect relaxing end to what was a hectic few weeks. Thank you again to everyone!",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5

Lisbon Destination Hostel,Davide L,15,Davide Lwrote a review Nov 2020,"This place is the perfect combination for who who want to be in a hostel atmosphere with the benefits of a hotel. The destination hostel is located in a central zone and everything inside is new, design is great, a minimalist one mixed with hipster choices. You can find ping pong tables, guitars, have your private space to chill and find shared space to connect and chat. The staff is friendly and helpful, they make you feel in a cool atmosphere. Especially Bruno and the Derrick. Me and my friend were there before the second covid lockdown but because of the hostel we enjoyed our experience a lot.",Nov,2020,Nov 2020,2020-11-01,2020,5
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Michael B,0,Michael Bwrote a review Dec 2016,Great location. The initial impression from the reception area and the corridors is that the hotel is a bit tired but the rooms themselves are very nicely furnished in quite a plush colourful style. We had two standard rooms which were fairly compact but very comfortable. The bathrooms were a good size if a little dark. The dining room despite being in a basement is a lovely room which looks on to a nice courtyard. The buffet breakfast was good although the milk jug was irritatingly small. We had dinner in the hotel over Christmas. The food was excellent. What sets this hotel apart however was the staff. They were wonderfully helpful and friendly. An illustration is that they had already collected our car and had parked it in front of the hotel on the morning we checked out  in anticipation of our departure.  I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Lisbon.,Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Deborah,1,Deborahwrote a review Jul 2022,"Third visit to this hotel, staff all cannot do enough for you. Good to see familiar faces as well as some new ones.  We stayed in the junior suite again, more expensive but we like the that it’s higher up with a balcony and away from the noise outside and at the pool. The space is great for the kids both in the apartment and lounge areas. There is a great play park just across the road for all ages. We always stay b&b as we like to get out to some of the local restaurants. Hope to be back either later this year or next!",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,4
Palacio Vila Flor,Ellen A,118,Ellen Awrote a review Feb 2015,"Perched on top of Alfama and hidden away in a small travessa you find this small courtyard collection of individual appartments. In the courtyard you have outdoor seating facilities perfect for a relaxed drink after exploring the city. Efficient and personal service, quirky decor with all the spice pots on the gate and decorative laundry lines. Very charming.Each appartment is vertical with internal stairs connecting the levels (we had three) with kitchen facilities at the entrance level.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,5
Palacio Vila Flor,kathleen m,25,kathleen mwrote a review Apr 2017,"My husband and i spent 4 nights in Palacio Vila Flor in the Alfama district of Lisbon.  It was very reasonably priced for a hotel in a very popular area of the city.   We had a clean room with a private bath that was very quiet.  The staff that we met, especially Triago, were friendly and very helpful.  There were 2 outside patio areas for relaxing and enjoying the weather.  Breakfast was included and provided juice,coffee, cereal, breads, pastries ect.  We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Lisbon and likes small hotels and a good nights sleep.",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,5

PortoBay Liberdade,1Brigitte1957,3,1Brigitte1957wrote a review Apr 2018,Booked a Classic room and possibly had the worst room location in the hotel.  Rooms are very small and we could barely find room to put our 2 suitcases.  Bathroom was cramped.  Woke up at 3:00 am with door banging shut because we were located by a staff only door. The view from our window was an apartment building where we stared at people hanging their laundry and smoking.  Four coffee pods are provided in your room but once you use them up you have to pay $2.50 Euros per pod.....really????  We used those up our first morning (given how small the cups are).  I do not feel that this hotel gave value for the money we spent.  On the plus side the buffet breakfast was excellent.  Didn’t care for the lounge at all.,Apr,2018,Apr 2018,2018-04-01,2018,2
Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,mleahy7,2,mleahy7wrote a review Jun 2013,"Stay here! You won't regret it. The place is really clean and has plenty of space, so you don't feel cramped. There are tons of things to do both in the hostel and around (the beaches and old town are not far). The staff is amazing- they definitely make sure you feel comfortable and have a good time. And the surf lessons were superb. Whether you're there to surf or not, you'll enjoy your stay! (But I highly recommend surfing!!)",Jun,2013,Jun 2013,2013-06-01,2013,5
Luna Clube Oceano,Alan D,6,Alan Dwrote a review Sep 2015,"Booked this trip through Thomas Cook self catering at a budget price, was not expecting great things for the price we paid. On arrival we were greeted at reception and shown to our apartment on the 2nd floor, what a lovely surprise the room was very spacious and the kitchen was very well equipped, 4 ring hob, micro wave, coffee percolator and much more. Large balcony with table & chairs and clothes dryer with a view over the pool area. the studio was spotless clean, beds made up every day and towels and sheets changed 3 times in our stay. We only eat in once but the standard and portion was as you would get from any local restaurant. Very quiet at nights, as this hotel is situated on a small one way side road off the main road into town, no problem with sleeping, and air con was not noisy at all. Hotel is situated between the old town and the \"Strip\" about 15 minutes walk in either direction. Walk to the old town is down hill, but beware on the way home as the hill seems to get steeper. but you can always catch the small land train that runs around Albuferia and stops just at the top of the road. The beach is approx 300 meters down hill and there are sun beds, toilets and 2 beach bars, if you want you can walk all along the beach to the old town,we did so several times. Pool area was great, only problem is towels are put on sunbeds early in the morning and people do not show up until later in the day, 2 hot tubs on the terrace above the bar and a small gym looking out over the pool. We had a great stay and still do not know way this is only rated as 3 star. We will definitely be returning again in the near future",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,3
Four Seasons Fairways,FUNCOACHVancouver_WA,4,FUNCOACHVancouver_WAwrote a review Jan 2009,"Parking was directly across the street from our Villa. Went through the white gate and was greeted by our own swimming pool...not large, yet one could get swim and certainly soak when the weather gets warm....all the chairs/tables were there. Oh yes, terry robes were hanging in the rooms.The villa was spacious with a complete, roomy kitchen with separate dining area. Living room comfortable with a view of the golf course.Bedroom spacious -- lots of closet space....Master bedroom was sort of a tower area and truly lacking for nothing.Place is well situated to explore. Car is needed. Not near the water, yet easy to navigate the roads that go by majestic homes.Staff was very pleasant...want to go back.",Jan,2009,Jan 2009,2009-01-01,2009,3
Casa Mitchell Apartments,MamaHevs,108,MamaHevswrote a review Oct 2010,"We stayed at the Casa Mitchell apartments from 23 to 30 September. We  arrived late due to having to avoid French Air space due to strikes. We were the last drop off and the receptionist had waited the extra two hours for us to arrive (the reception is in the pension on the opposite side of the road). Our apartment was room  n the ground floor in the corner and was nice and quiet. It looked out over a small garden and the pool of the apartment block next door (which was very quiet). The apartment was spacious and well furnished and well equipped (we had can openers, bottle openers and everything else we would need (but boy the beds are hard. Yes, the TV as a small portable on a bracket on the wall but I do not go on holiday to watch sky TV. Out apartment had a hallway off which was the bathroom and the bedroom which had aircon.The pool area was very quiet with just  3 or 4 couples around most days. We spent 2 afternoons out there and sun beds no problem. I can only assume that some keys are on different type fobsAs for location, it is in a side street just 5 minutes walk from the front down the side of the Rocamar Hotel. Leave the apartments and turn right and follow the pavement round until you reach some steps. go down th steps and cross the road, almost in front of you at the side of the Roamar Hotel are some more steps which take you onto the promenade. Turn left and walk towards the town centre or turn left and walk towards the lift down to the beach, or carry on and walk down to the harbour and the marina (15 - 20 minutes walk. To get to the old town centre square, turn left out of the hotel and at the end of the road cross over and go up the side street at the side of the garage and then go right. You will pass the church on your left and see Merlins bar in front of you. Head down past Merlins and you start to hit some of the bars. Eddy'ssports bar just after Merlins is great for the major sports fixtures and also sells Pear Cider - the only place I found that sold it. Carry on along this road and you come to the Sol E Mar hotel on your right and 2 flights of steps down to one of the main streets on your left. Steps bar has live acoustic music played by Martin John who is fabulous. On this road any of the turnings on the right will take yuu on to the square. The Rock Cafe is great for the live music but a bit pricey on the beer front. Carry on across the square and there is a road crammed full of bars and live music in many of them.We had a walk to the new town to the strip but much preferred the old town (although I did buy a very nice cotton sun dress for 12 euros on the strip).Will we go back - yes but probably not to the apartments, we may try the Rocamar of the Sol E Mar",Oct,2010,Oct 2010,2010-10-01,2010,4

Highly recommend.I just wish there was a common pool for all guests (and ages) to enjoy at the hotel... That would make this hotel a 6 star resort.,Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,4
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",657fiona,0,657fionawrote a review Sep 2025,"We loved our stay at Reid's, from the moment you arrived you are greeted warmly, the hotel has a traditional feel, but is well decorated and very comfortable. the bar terrace with a view looking over Funchal is spectacular . Our room was super luxurious, the beds you just sink into, free soft drinks in the mini bar and tea and coffee , bottle of Madeira too. I'm Gluten free  but all my food requirements were met easily and without fuss. Fantastic breakfast buffet on the pool terrace each morning.GF separate table for toast and other treats.  We had our special celebration at Villa Cipriani ,just wow .. the view is amazing, food delicious and service excellent. You'll need to book ahead and it's super popular. Loved the ice-cream parlour too, great way of being sustainable. Choice of 3 pools, salt, fresh water or sea water .Access to the sea for a dip too, free loan of kayaks or paddle boards.All in all you won't go wrong booking this hotel , it's our second time staying here and we would certainly go back.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,5

But be aware: w-ifi internet is available only at lobby, and room temperature can not be properly set by clients. There is some kind of preset adjust made by hotel that does nor allow you to cool the room. Ok, if you keep the windows opened it is colder, but is so much noisy as well specially if you are located sided to the road. Restaurant service and food quality for dinner exceeded our expectations. Breakfast service is average as well.",May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,3
Royal Savoy Hotel,Alan B,171,Alan Bwrote a review Jun 2009,"We stayed for our second year at the Royal Savoy. Guests are mainly of an age where gentile surroundings are appropriate and seek old fashioned courtesies and excellent service combined with the calm, relaxed, spacious accommodation that is on offer.This is a very good resort where the food is also of an exceptional standard but at a price although this year they have introduced a three or five day eat in ticket for breakfasy and dinner for about 37 euro per person per day. It is good value if you want to eat in.Eating out is a pleasure for the palate and the wallet.The area behind the resort has some splendid restaurants, Don Amelia. Casa Don Velha to name but two.It is a short stroll downhill yo the old town, you can get a bus back, the buses are regular and inexpensive, walk in the opposite  direction towards and past Reids and you pass other large hotels and restaurants arriving at the Lido, carry on walking along the main road and you come very soon to a lovely cafe/bar with a terrace overlooking the sea that is wholesome and inexpensive for Madeira It is called Casbah.Taxi transfer on arrival is 31 e and you may get a better deal prebooking.Currently Funchal seems less busy that on ourprevious visits and there are excellent deals on half day or full day trips and even in some restaurants.A truly relaxing place if that is what you want but with lots to do, walks, gardens to visit, cable car rides, sea trips if you like that but not a holiday place I would recommend for young families",Jun,2009,Jun 2009,2009-06-01,2009,4

Saccharum,Stephan H,0,Stephan Hwrote a review Nov 2023,"I’ve just completed my wonderful stay at Saccharum Resort and Spa in Madeira, Portugal. The property, the room, the restaurants, the staff, and the spa are all as good (if not better) than at any 5-Star property I’ve ever stayed. The resort is impeccably maintained, modern and beautiful!  My ocean view was room large, clean and well appointed with a very comfortable mattress and bedding, amazing rainfall shower, and a bidet!  My room attendant, Ana, did a fantastic job!  It’s so nice to still have twice daily (make up and turn down) service as a standard and not a request. The spa is world class!  I had one of the best massages I’ve ever had by Mary. I ate at the al fresco restaurant Trapiche every night. I had the seafood and fish “casserole” twice.  It’s not really a casserole, but more of a large platter of amazing fresh seafood (prawn, lobster, mussels, scallops and three types of local fish) cooked to perfection!  The strawberry, yogurt mousse, and basil ice cream dessert was incredible!  I had it three nights in a row!  I would also like to thank two Diogo’s. Diogo in reception was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and accommodating!  He went out of his way to offer assistance, make suggestions, reservations, and travel arrangements. And the other Diogo, in the Fly Lounge, was also very nice, attentive, and accommodating!  Overall, it was an amazing experience and I will definitely be returning!",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,5

It is extremely clean and tidy.  It has a fantastic pool area and even a gym which I did use.The quality of the food is also very good.  We opted for room and breakfast.  The breakfast had everything and was also fresh no matter what time you arrived at the buffet.  The food, whether in the restaurant or outside at the pool bar was always consistently good.There were also a few excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.Outside of the hotel a five minutes walk will take you to 3 excellent beaches.  A quick taxi or the “road train”. Will take you into the town of Armação de Pêra. We tended to walk in 30 min stroll and taxi back.Overall a first class experience",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,5

Natura Algarve Club,59stepstoheaven,52,59stepstoheavenwrote a review Jun 2016,"Good location, right in the centre for shops, restaurants, pubs.  Mainly occupied by groups of youngsters who were at times quite rowdy and had to be told in more than one occasion to turn their music down.  Apartments are at the bottom of a hill which some people may find steep so wouldn't be suitable for people with mobility problems.  We did have an issue with no running water in one day with no apology or explanation.  We found the cleaning to be sporadic, with some days only being left a toilet roll on the outside door handle.  My husband ended up sweeping the balcony on many occasions.The apartments are in lovely grounds, the pool area was nice, pool freezing but they always are in Portugal.  All in all we did enjoy our holiday but mainly down to the weather, would we return to the Natura - no.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4
Noah Surf House,Mr G,220,Mr Gwrote a review Sep 2019,"Just arrived home after a fantastic stay at Noah Surf House. Upon arrival, you feel comfortable as the place makes you relax being open plan, calm colours (lots of recycled wood) and full of people who are all calm :-). We've stayed at high-end resorts before, but Noah was actually much better than most places we've been to - I genuinely felt like I'd been away for weeks after only a few days!Check-in was efficient and after a short guided tour, we were in our room which was great. They are very simple with no AC (they have opening windows to let the sea breeze in), but they are perfect for a good nights sleep (bathrooms could do with a few extra shelves though).Breakfasts are a highlight - very fresh, nutritious and a great start to the day. Azeem takes great care with preparation and makes a wicked omelette of your choice. The healthy fruit bowls are delicious, especially the spinach, avocado and banana!!The staff around the bar and reception are really good as well - very friendly and helpful. They made my little boy very happy with the chocolate & banana milkshakes although we then had to content with an energy burst from him.If you want activity, there is everything from fitness classes, pool yoga, skateboarding and obviously surfing, but they also have things for younger ones - muffin making and helping in the sustainable garden which are really nice touches.My whole family really enjoyed our stay and big thanks to all the staff who made us feel incredibly welcome and at home.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,5

The room was kept very clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful.We did have a problem with a noisy group of lads in their 30s acting more like 13 in the four rooms next to us getting back at 5am so we complained to reception, but the reception must have told them who complained as they bumped into us threw balls at us when laying near the pool and trying to spoil our time.It is not the hotels fault that idiots book their rooms ! we were just unlucky.The highlight of our holiday was to find a gluten free restaurant (set back) on the strip called Frogs which is a coeliacs heaven. The owners daughter is a coeliac so your safe here.Gary the street rep recommended the pizza stating they get 5 stars and it will be the best gluten free pizza I have ever had, well not only was it the best gluten free pizza I have ever had (coeliac for 10 years) it was the best I have ever had.

Kids loved the kids area with pirate ship and kids paddling pool and as its all closed off it is a safe area for young kids also.

Nothing was too much trouble for the very friendly and attentive staff - airport transfers, restaurant recommendations and bookings, sightseeing recommendations, taxi bookings, securely storing luggage until the evening of departure day are just a few of the things they did for us.  It may be 'only' a B&B, but what a great B&B!  There are many restaurants and bars within easy walking distance of Canto de Luz and the nearest Metro station (Trindade) is 5 minutes away on foot.

Ocean Gardens,Ian C,2,Ian Cwrote a review Jun 2017,"We have had a lovely stay here. No complaints. The hotel is just a marketed. Breakfast is good, and will suit all. The hotel is a 5 to 10 minute drive from the city and will cost you 10 euro including the tip (8.6 euro plus tip) or you can take the bus which passes every hour right at the hotel. The bus is about 2 euros each. A bus time table will be given to you in reception. Importantly, when leaving the city you will need to catch bus 39 and this is one street back from the main bus stop. So, you will have the cable car, then the main bus stop (which you don't want) then behind the big white building another smaller bus stop point. This is where you need to be.The cost of this hotel was about£55 per night in early June, and we were well happy with that.We intent to come back next year and would book hete again.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,5

Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,vuepoint,190,vuepointwrote a review May 2016,"As with many guests we were not in this hotel by choice but because of flooding on the River Douro preventing our planned cruise. The location was good walking distance from the river the building was all glitter and glass and lacked that intimate feel of a traditional Portuguese hotel. Our bedroom was spacious with a well appointed bathroom. We dined in the hotel restaurant having a fairly ordinary meal of Vegetable Soup, Salmon with potato salad and Lemon Cheesecake for dessert. A bottle of Burmeste Red Wine completed the meal. We had no complaints regarding the quality of food or service, not special but adequate. Breakfast was buffet style healthy wake up options and the usual cooked fare. Hotel had a Health and Fitness Club",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,3

Philomena and her team went out of their way to provide excellent customer service.  Definitely recommend this B&B and when visiting the area would stay there again.  By the way, from my perspective, a day trip to Sintra is not enough time in this beautiful, historical town.  We stayed for 3 days and could have stayed longer.

Camping Villa Park Zambujeira do Mar,Colleen M,246,Colleen Mwrote a review Feb 2019,"We arrived here intending to stay for 3 weeks and ended up staying 3 months which is testament to what a brilliant site this is.We have a large Fifth Wheeler pulled by a Toyota Hilux but had no problem in finding a pitch big enough to accommodate our rig.All the staff were fabulous, from the girls in reception to Manuel in the shop, bar and restaurant and the cleaners. They were all so friendly and amenable and special thanks to Anna in reception who helped me no end with various admin needs.The site is clean, has a brilliant supermarket which stocks everything and a good bar and restaurant. My only negative feedback is that drinks are served in plastic cups and nowadays this is a definite no-no.The site is a short walk from the little town which has a stunning beach and lots of bars and restaurants and the big town of Vila Nova do Milfontes is only a 20 minute drive away and is one of the most loveliest towns in Portugal.One drawback was that there was no entertainment laid on at all over Xmas/New Year. I know of a lot of campers that moved off the site for this reason.Also, the campsite we are staying on at the moment has a Happy Hour. Admittedly, there is no bar here so everyone brings their own drinks to the decking area where there are plenty of table and chairs by the reception area. This is held twice a week and is such a good idea to bring people together.However, many thanks to all the staff at Camping Villa Park for making our stay so enjoyable. We will definitely be backWe had friends and family who came over to visit us and stayed in the bungalows on site.

Legendary Lisboa Suites,GordonT27,83,GordonT27wrote a review Dec 2013,"We stayed here for three nights. Having read other reviews I was a bit concerned, I need not have been. Arrival and check in could not have been easier. We stayed in a suite with a lounge/diner, double bed room and small kitchen. TV in both lounge and bedroom. Bathroom more than adequate. Rooms were to the front of the hotel and there have been reports of noise. OK there was the odd lorry and voices from the street but it is a working city nothing excessive or worth complaining about. Staff were fine the Lady on reception in the morning was excellent her male counter parts less so but not rude as reported. The issue with with fi is a bit annoying. To charge 10euros for one days access as the minimum you can have is a bit annoying. It is 2013 after all. I have read that the answer is to use the MacDonalds across the road. Fine if it's working which it wasn't when I tried. There is a supermarket down the road , turn left down to the main road and it's on the opposite corner. If you get this hotel for a good price and don't desperately need wi fi then it's a good hotel. There is a pool but not for me in November but it looked fine and not something you will always find in a city centre hotel.We had a small problem with a TV and the heating but a call to reception and a visit from the techies and all was repaired efficiently and professionally. Breakfast was buffet style and although small had everything you could look for including bacon that was not the usual stuff you get abroad but what we are familiar with. Good value on promotion for less than 8 euros.A three day travel pass cost 18.50 Euros and is well worth it. It covers buses, metro, trams, boats and elevators, buy at the airport metro station. Incidentally the metro to the centre of town only takes about 15 minutes. If you are heading to the Clarion suites change at San Sebastion ( or Portuguese version of it) then off at Marquese de Pombal, apologies for the spelling. It is an uphill walk so careful. If you are in town and after a busy day you don't want that walk, a taxi will run about six euros. All in all a good base to explore this beautiful city.",Dec,2013,Dec 2013,2013-12-01,2013,3
Hotel Principe Lisboa,Fabio N,2,Fabio Nwrote a review Jun 2018,"The hotel is a 3-star property with a great location and just across from the subway station. Impeccably clean, and yet my room was not exactly large, it was comfortable, as well, and answered my needs while in town given I spent the whole day out.The breakfast is very good, with a nice assortment of fruits, cold cuts, juice, breads cereals, tea, milk, coffee and Portuguese pastries. The bar/cafeteria is a nice quiet place for a late drink and a relaxing conversation with Pedro, the friendly bar tender. The check-in and check-out was fast and courteous. The whole hotel team was absolutely friendly and helpful.The neighborhood is nice, quiet and calm with a bar, a bakery, a rental bike store and a small grocery store at less than a block away, and a few restaurants and nice cafes at no more than 10-15 min walking distance. The Calouste-Gulbenkiam Foundation is at a short walking distance from the property and may well represent an option where to spend a bunch of hours in, as well.Yet the subway station is just across from the front door, walking to Largo dos Restauradores, the door to the old town, takes no more than relaxing 30 min.

Pousada Viseu,Kurantje,64,Kurantjewrote a review Jun 2019,"The hotel is a converted hospital, but unfortunately the renovation left little evidence of its history. They tell about it when checking in, otherwise you might not notice... One thing I found surprising: they have lots of pictures of the reconstruction, but none of the days the place was a hospital. Pity, as it would give the building more character.The room (we were on the 4th floor, added as part of the rebuild) was like most larger hotel rooms. Everything right where you expect it to be.The double bed medium firm like other Pestana Pousada, a standard bathroom. The balcony is nice, the view only nice when overlooking the old town, otherwise nothing special.The bar/lounge area is in the 'courtyard': the roofed over center part of the building. It's quite noise, all sounds echoing loudly in this large space. The need to bring a sound architect in there to find a solution.
