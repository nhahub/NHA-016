Herdade Da Matinha,cupjackson,57,cupjacksonwrote a review Jun 2018,"I found Herdade da Matinha on a cute Portuguese travel website. The photos were amazing and it looked perfect. So we booked. If you do book here, make sure you contact the nana gent before your stay. GPS/google will lead you VERY astray down many dirt roads... we almost got stuck in our rental car ( and we are well travelled and have done many back country drives but an Opal compact didn’t quite meet these roads standards). My comment to the hotel is to please send your directions to your guests more than day of. If we had received and email the say before while in our previous hotel we would have had directions.  As we didn’t have WiFi driving from Algarve the email sent to us same day/ while on the road was not at helpful.We finally made it without getting stuck. The reception is hard to find from the outside. The woman helping us was cold and seemed to not want to help us. She gave us a quick tour and gave us a room. Not at all like the website by the way. Room is dark and small and musty. The floor by door super bubbly and water damaged. The bathroom mildewed. The AC/fan unit was broken so it was warm at night and airless if you opened the door ( no windows in the room) all bugs  flew in because it’s the country. I’ve lived in the country. Yes there are bugs. But there are screens in windows in many places in the world as well. So a window would have been nice. Or a screen. Or a working fan.The room had a coffee maker and fridge with honesty bar but though a beer would have been nice ( or cooling the water we had) the fridge did not work.Bathroom musty. Hot water worked only sporadically. The solar powered hot water we had in an Eco lodge in Belize worked better.The website and hotels.com both said there was WiFi in the hotel and in the rooms. Not any in room. Barely working in hotel. We weren’t there to surf the web but as tourists without a phone we kind of needed the internet to look up beaches, road maps etc. It’s a good thing to know ahead of time if you need internet to plan... I had to spend a lot of time in common areas just to get directions or check our next booking etc, things I’d normally like to do in bed.All of these things would have been fine if I had known that’s what I was paying for. But as this was one of the more expensive hotels we booked and the web site so beautiful I expected more.The common areas were cute, thank goodness since our room was terrible. Nothing amazing but still cute.Breakfast was a high point. Lots of good standards and fresh bread. Plentiful coffee and teas. Pancakes and eggs to order. The chef was really sweet.Dinner was good but way overpriced. For €28 euro a person plus wine costs I would have expected more quality, creativity, and quantity. A small crudités, chicken and rice. We ate far better everywhere else in Portugal for far less, even fancy-ish places in Lisbon were less.High points: the countryside it’s in is beautiful! It’s an amazing local with paths and trees and flowers and goats. Super quaint and lovely. Common areas nice, cute dog running around, 2 of the concierge people were very sweet.I think if we’d had a nice room ( I figured ordering a king room it would be nice?) or that the website didn’t over exaggerate its niceness ( looks 4 star online) or that I was with a few children and there as a local country escape or something it’d be fine. Definitely not a romantic 4 star country escape. More of a family place, just above hostel quality, not worth what we paid.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,2
Villas Barrocal,AlexJoan,50,AlexJoanwrote a review May 2015,"Accommodation are spacious and well equipped . Cleaning of apartments and the changing of towels are sporadic . Change of towels twice a week in my opinion is not enough .Good sized pool area and pool bar with snacks. Pera is a quiet sleepy village and only has 1 restaurant opened at night. Car is essential as beach and other eating establishment are at least 1/2 hour walk away. Nearest being Alcantarilha which has 3 restaurants close to each other beside the main church square .Taxi to Alcanatrilha 6 euros, Guia or Armacao de pera approx 9 euros. If you are looking for a quiet relaxing holiday this is the place for you .Wifi very poor although not everyone needs it. Looking forward to a return visit.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Beachparker,0,Beachparkerwrote a review Jul 2018,"We completed our four night stay on July 9. The hotel and amenities are nice and the location and views are great.  Short walk to the beach and 10 minute drive to town. This was a family trip and our first time to Portugal. Unfortunately as several have said the guy at check-in was not welcoming by any means and he had major attitude.  I didn't get the man's name but we arrived at least 3 hours prior to the 4p.m. check-in.  He didn't want to store our bags while we waited for the rooms, didn't want to assist us with getting information on how to get to a tour that we booked the following day and basic questions about towels and the washing machine were answered with complete annoyance.  That being said, we later encountered Hugo at the front desk and he was fantastic.  He called taxi's for us, suggested restaurants, booked reservations and was very friendly and more than willing to look information up for us and give advice and suggestions. Miguel was also helpful.  If we hadn't encountered Hugo, our stay would not have been pleasant.  The staff at both restaurants near the beach were extremely rude.  We traveled with another family and there were 8 of us.  We tried for an early dinner around 5:30 at Antonio's and we were told that they couldn't accommodate us because they were expecting a large crowd to watch the World Cup game at around 9p.m., even though the restaurant was practically empty.  A server at the restaurant closest to the hotel was rude as well and practically laughed at us when we told her we didn't have reservations and said we can't help you. On the other hand, the staff at the hotel restaurant was great and the food was good. I would stick with the hotel restaurant if you don't have time to go in to town for lunch or dinner.  If you are going out to eat especially for dinner it's best to make reservations. If you are taking a taxi from the hotel give at least 15 minutes for the taxi to arrive plus time to get to your destination.  Apparently there are only about 30 taxis in the area and they are very busy so they don't always come right away.  If you have a reservation make sure to build in that time.  We didn't use Uber so I don't know what their timing is like.We didn't use the spa, the pools were quiet, and you should definitely do the hiking trail on the cliffs by the beach to see the beautiful views.  Walk down the beach to see the different rock formations up close. If you are used to washcloths for showers you will have to bring your own.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,4

Vila Gale Porto Ribeira,dag0x,8,dag0xwrote a review Nov 2018,"Located just a short walk from the attractions of the city center, this hotel was a great find for us. Very nice rooms, maintained in subdued colors, gave us a good rest after a day of sightseeing in the city. The cleaning staff keep the hotel spotless. The front desk staff were very helpful. Breakfasts tasty, everyone will find something for themselves. A historic tram passes in front of the hotel door itself, which adds to the hotel's charm. Next to the hotel there are bars and a restaurant of quite good quality. For those seeking a rest from the hustle and bustle of the city - an almost perfect place. Of course, as each place definitely has its drawbacks, we did not find them during our stay. Our stay was very successful. If I return to Porto again I will consider staying at this hotel.",Nov,2018,Nov 2018,2018-11-01,2018,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,vikkithompson86,0,vikkithompson86wrote a review Sep 2024,"Hotel spotlessly clean, all staff very friendly and helpful. Plenty to offer for children and families. Animation team were always great at getting children and adults involved in activities.Pools were cold to get in initially but once in they were actually lovely. Kids were in and out without any complaints!Food was always fresh and hot and nice, theme nights however limited in what they offered but we always found something. The main restaurant has an Italian area where you can have fresh pasta made to order and pizza on demand!They had a section for children with chicken nuggets, fish fingers etc and pancakes for breakfast!We didn’t try any of the bookable restaurants but others said they were lovely.Evening entertainment was poor and very repetitive but the kids enjoyed the mini disco and the inflatables at night.Overall we would definitely return and had no major faults with the hotel or resort.",Sep,2024,Sep 2024,2024-09-01,2024,3

Vila Gale Collection Braga,bigvol,36,bigvolwrote a review Apr 2023,"ProsLocation.Nice historic areas at front of the property.Check in staff was very nice.ConsHousekeeping never replaced the waters or coffee pods.  We had 2 people on the booking and they left 1 regular coffee pod and one decaf.  Really?Breakfast buffet was a zoo.Loud construction next door, don't plan to sleep in.Loud noise from meeting/party rooms below our room.  Bring earplugs or be ready with some white noise.Poor maintenance in the bathroom as the faucet shot a stream of water onto the counter and the toilet ran every 20 min or so.We tried to get an after drink on a friday night around 9:30 pm. The bar was \"open\"  with one patron in yhe corner and no visible staff.  We gave up and left after 5-10 minutes.  No surprise it was empty on a Friday night with that level of service.",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,2

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Harish P,60,Harish Pwrote a review Dec 2019,"There are good hotels, and there are great hotels. 1908 Lisboa is well on its way to become one of the great ones.Located just a 10 minute walk from the Rossio station, it is just far enough to offer you a deserved calm after a long day, yet being just close enough to afford you easy access on foot to the city center. It is also very convenient from the Aerobus  stop for those arriving from the airport. Metro station, just a 5 minute walk away. Felt very safe. So super location - checkNow for the hotel itself. Rarely do all things come together to deliver a superior hospitality experience, but at the 1908 Lisboa, they just do. Tastefully and luxuriously appointed rooms, super amenities, complemented by by the highest grade of customer service, and just that extra something special make the hotel one of the best I have stayed at. Nuno, and Sara at the front desk were excellent. Friendly, courteous and really on top of their games. Apologies for not recollecting his name, but  kudos too to this other staff member, who was great in helping me get set for my day trip to Sintra.The adjacent Infame restaurant, where the 1908 Lisboa has its breakfast service is just the cherry on the  top of the sundae. A very well thought out made to order breakfast menu is accompanied by a selection of  delicious breakfast breads, fresh juices, champagne and prepared to order espresso drinks. Shout out to Sara here, who took care of me really well on all 3 breakfast meals I had at the restaurantLisbon is s magical city. Staying at the 1908 really made the exploring it, a very comfortable and enjoyable experience.",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,5
A Casa Formosa,Claudia M,47,Claudia Mwrote a review Sep 2012,"Nice place, very easy to reach from the airport with the direction sent from Joao.We spent only one night; our room was very cleand, confortable and spacious. There are two bathrooms shared with other rooms but that was ok and both of them were cleaned. Breakfast is self made so you just select what you want from the kitchen. That is probabily the only uncomfortable aspect especially if all people arrive at the same time.From Casa Formosa you can easly reach the rest of the city with a nice and easy walk. There are also typical and not touristic restaurants nearby. Just ask the owner from some suggestions.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,4

The check in was quick, breakfast was good, the room was spacious with big windows and a great view of the square! The hotel staff showed us around the room. We got a welcome drink, complimentary tarts.. the small things that make a regular stay extra special!!The people on the front desk were very helpful with restaurant recommendations. The best feature of the hotel was a complimentary cellphone they provide for the stay. You can use it to navigate around the city as well as call locally and internationally.... EXTREMELY helpful when you’re in a new city and don’t always want to use your phone to navigate (and save the battery for clicking pictures :) )",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,5

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,AJMarriner,73,AJMarrinerwrote a review Jun 2016,"This place deserves a 3.5 in my opinion as the rooms are very clean and spacious, staff friendly, plenty of sunbeds (maybe slightly lacking in parasols) and based in a good location. We were self catering and had just about everything apart from an oven to use in the kitchen, washing machine and dish washer included! Our room was cleaned daily and new towels provided.The hotel provides a bus to other hotels part of the same chain as well as the old town, reception will give you a timetable of this in arrival. Old town is only a 10/15 minute walk back, we'd recommend walking back along the beach then just join back upto the road when you want.There are plenty of restaurants on the doorstep that we enjoyed, however the top place had to be the bakery. The fruit loaf was immense first thing on a morning, poa do passon (sp?) If i remember correctly!One main note is that it seems popular with stag and hen dos as we encountered a few during our week stay but if anything they provided the day time entertainment!",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,3
1908 Lisboa Hotel,Urban Explorer,155,Urban Explorerwrote a review May 2022,"We stayed in May at the end of our trip to Portugal and after a long two years of going nowhere.Located in a mixed but starting to be gentrified part of the city this hotel really stands out. Very walkable to lots of spots and so close to public trams, busses, and metro in every direction. This award winning hotel, built in 1908 and fully restored and re-opened in 2017, we felt pampered from check in to check out.André and Carolina bent over backwards to help us navigate this wonderful city. From booking and printing out tickets in advance to helping us get into the fabled and always booked up Cervejaria Ramiro across the street, Andre gave new meaning to the word “hospitality.” We are forever grateful for his personal attention.We stayed in room 207 which was a Superior Plus and worth paying the extra for if you stay for a number of nights. Facing the square, it was still fairly quiet once you closed the windows. A small balcony off the bathroom is perfect for two people to enjoy a glass of something cold and watch the world unfold below.They provide a free large bottle of water every morning. As well, we were given a voucher for a welcome drink Which we enjoyed at the the outdoor bar/terrace below. It’s little things like this that are important.Breakfasts were not only bountiful, with the usual array of fruit, breads, spreads, yoghurt, cheeses, meats, and pastries but they’ll also make you fresh eggs any way you like them. From scrambled to poached to Benedict. Perhaps the best breakfast we’ve had in Europe.Victor helped us every morning. His welcoming smile and the strong espressos he brought us without asking once he got to know our preference, was the perfect tonic to start the day.Once again the little things.Rooms were cleaned daily and shower pressure was very good. Beds ensured a good nights sleep.We ate at the hotel resto, Infame, one night outdoors, and it was delicious. Afternoon drinks on the patio.  A lovely spot to take a break and unwind after a long day of navigating the sights.We’d stay here again in a heartbeat on our next visit to Lisbon.You should too.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,5

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,avis l,44,avis lwrote a review Nov 2013,"I was a little concerned before arriving because this hotel's location seemed to be isolated from the main part of the city.  I was pleasantly relieved to find the taxi and train service very convenient and reasonable.  Hotel staff was always available to secure the right sized taxi for our group.  The hotel has excellent food,, but if you want something different and reasonable in cost, take a short cab ride to the mall.  You will be pleasantly surprised.  Brazilian steakhouse and many other choices. The train station is about a 5 minute walk away.Our son was traveling with us,, so staying at a Marriott property in Lisbon gave us the advantage of having a king sized bed and a roll-a-way option,,  not always available in European hotels.  Nice large bathroom with full tub or shower option.  My husband really enjoyed the balcony, but the view was not the greatest from our room.",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Greg A,135,Greg Awrote a review Mar 2013,"I stayed one night at this hotel at the end of February 2013.  I have stayed here previously, and I have always enjoyed the treatment that I received from the staff.  The hotel itself is a short taxi ride from the airport.  It is in reasonably good shape, but it suffers a little from wear and tear and could use new carpeting in the hallways and rooms and a general facelift throughout the hotel.  Though somewhat dated, the hotel still offers its guests a comfortable stay at a very affordable price.The executive lounge offers snacks and coffee/tea/water/soft drinks throughout the day.  It is a good place to enjoy a cup of coffee while getting some work done.  I was able to hold a meeting with two business colleagues in the lounge without being disturbed.  We enjoyed coffee and snacks as we discussed our business together.  The lounge also has a terrace, which can be enjoyed most of the year and even during the daytime in winter months.Though I was only in the hotel for a day, I was impressed by the hospitality of the staff.  They went out of their way to greet their guests and make them feel important.  As was noted below, the fitness center is not in the best condition.  I used the treadmill while I stayed.  There was no heat in the fitness room, which made it quite cold and uncomfortable.  I eventually warmed up my body temperature during my run, but the first 10 minutes were both miserable and humorous at the same time.  I have never run on an indoor treadmill with my teeth chattering.  I actually started laughing during my run as I thought about the silliness of the situation.  Once I was about 10 minutes into the run, I was warm enough that the cold did not bother me.I took breakfast in their basement restaurant called \"Citrus Restaurant.\"  The breakfast buffet offers a nice selection, and the food itself is quite good.  The buffet offers eggs to order, breakfast meats, cold cuts, vegetables, bread and pastries, cereal, and fresh fruit.  I have always found Portuguese food to be delicious, and the hotel reinforces my impression.  The hotel is not in the city center, but anyone looking to go to the historic area can take a taxi or ride the metro there.  I was able to walk to a restaurant located in the neighborhood behind the hotel.  It was a short walk and worth the effort to eat at an authentic Portuguese restaurant.On the morning of my departure, I requested a late check-out due to the fact that my meeting took a little longer than I anticipated.  The staff granted me another two hours, which was more than I needed.  I hope to get back to Lisbon later in the year, and when I do, I plan to stay again at this hotel.",Mar,2013,Mar 2013,2013-03-01,2013,4

The rooms, while small did not pos a problem as we were literally just sleeping them at night and spent the day out seeing the sights of Lisbon. Perhaps if you were staying longer than a couple of days you might want a bit more space.The breakfast was varied and very tasty - pastries, natas, cereals, breads, fruit and hot breakfast. And was served until 11:30!The hotel is a 10minute walk to the main city, and maybe €5 in a taxi from Barrio Alto - an area with lots of bars and restaurants.There was some noise from the road but not enough to stop us sleeping as we were on the 4th floor.For the price, this hotel is definitely value for money.",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,4
Luna Clube Oceano,albertz58,5,albertz58wrote a review Jul 2009,"Just arrived back 24th July 2009 after a great 12 Days.After reading other reviews before we went my Wife and I were worried about what we would expect from this hotel. We knew the area was good because we have been in this vicinity 3 years previous.BUT when we arrived we were met with the reception staff who spoke very good English and gave us a very friendly welcome.We were on the ground floor with a very spacious room, which was clean and tidy and had all we needed for our stay ie, Fridge, microwave, cooker, kettle etc. The room was air conditioned and the maids were in every day to change the towels and wash the floor. The bed linen was chaged 3 times during our 12 day stay which I would say was sufficient. Being on the ground floor gave great access to the pool and resturuant,  up 5 steps and you were there. As for the sun loungers, we had no problem getting one at any time.There is entertainment laid on in the Hotel bar every night which was good, but not a lot of residents went, I think it could have been advertised a bit more.The location was great, we were situated halfway between old Albuferia and the Strip which was only a 10 - 15 minute stroll. There was also a supertmarket, newsagent and other shops and bars on the door step, and in only a few minutes you were on the beach.I cant think of any bad points, everything was great, and we were more than satisfied with our Holiday.",Jul,2009,Jul 2009,2009-07-01,2009,5

The Vine House - Quinta São Luiz,Richard D,12,Richard Dwrote a review Jun 2025,The hotel has beautiful views but residents are not catered for. The restaurant and terrace has obviously a corporate interest and used for commercial purposes. Residents are expected to walk to get drinks from a small bar away from hotel  and bring them back to the hotel. However that area   is usually very busy full of coach parties.We have stayed at many Quinta’s and never found that the residents were treated as second class.It is stated you can park outside room but with so many cars and buses this is not always possible.You can eat in the restaurant in the evening but when it’s closed you are really paying for an upmarket bed and breakfast and are not expected to return until all the corporate entertaining has finished.  There are far too many competing corporate interests for this to be an enjoyable holiday venue.,Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,2

On most evenings the restaurant was full to capacity. Chef is introducing new menus and the Chefs Wok evening is an exceptionally tasty fare which we thoroughly enjoyed on both weeks.There is a great atmosphere in the restaurant and the professional staff make one feel so at ease. This is now excellent value for money.One of our waiters Mr. Miguel E Santo made our evenings even more enjoyable by making us feel special. It is refreshing to see much younger waiters and waitresses joining the team and Daniel, Vanessa and Paulo are also to be commended for their professionalism and sense of humour.The apartments having been decorated to a high standard initially are holding up well and being refurbished continuously.

Torel Palace Porto,Sekok,230,Sekokwrote a review Jul 2021,"We booked a “suite superior” for 5 nights, arriving on July 3rd. After a welcome drink (a glass of Champagne at the Blind restaurant, in the hotel basement), we were lodged in suite 12 (Fernando Pessoa) on 2nd floor. This stunning property is located in an unimpressive street around the corner of Batalha square, approx 15 minutes walk from São Bento train station and the Se Cathedral. Object of a very recent conservative and complex restoration to its original grandeur as ‘800 bourgeois palace, Torel Palace is truly a gem featuring some bold architectural choices, such as the mirrored box at the center of the room, which hosts the lavatory and the bathroom. A kind of sci-fi object, half way between a Kubrik’s 2001 Space Odyssey monolith on the outside and Nolan’s Interstellar “tesseract” on the inside (see attached pictures for a reference) is both a massive and at times almost an undetectable presence. In addition to the classic minibar, the room featured a dedicated small wine fridge with a selection of local wines. Staff was very welcoming and charming, particularly at the restaurant where breakfast is also served. The management has found an interesting way to operate a buffet breakfast, still observing all sanitary restriction currently in force. In particular, each client had a personal clamp to pick up food, and many products (such as jam, marmalade, butter and cereals) where individually packaged in sealed glass jars. We spent 5 wonderful days, surrounded by perfect comfort. We had dinner in the following restaurants, which are all located approximately 15-20 minutes walk form the property: èLeBe (across the street, in front of the hotel), Tapabento (R. da Madeira 222, near São Bento train station),  Alibi By Yours (Rua dos Caldeireiros 135), Artesao Bistrot (R. de Mouzinho da Silveira 218), Euskalduna Studio (R. de Santo Ildefonso 404).

We arrived very, very late in the evening but were warmly welcomed. The apartment was overlooking the pool and much better than we expected, with a well fitted out kitchen and spacious accommodation, the only thing which could have made it better would have been a double bed. Located in a quiet area but within 5 minutes walk from a well stocked supermarket, 10 minutes from the 'Strip', and the beach was less than 15 minutes walk away. Our room was kept very clean by the maids. The pool area was clean and well laid out on different levels.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,jbash253,2,jbash253wrote a review Jul 2024,"I have been going  to Portugal for over 20 years and can honestly say this is the worst hotel I have stayed in. We booked a deluxe room with sea or pool view , we got neither, this was on our booking . The reservations/ reception were not helpful  at all . We  had ants all over the room , they were in the bed as well , again no help from anybody. The room was fine but there was not enough places to put stuff away . The terrace was full of seagull poop and this wasnâ€™t cleaned till a week after we arrived .Lots of groups of males and females , felt like Benidorm on a weekend, noisy and I didnâ€™t feel safe or comfortable. The place doesnâ€™t take cash ,only card  and you canâ€™t have a tab  and pay at the end of the holiday at the reception , it does say this when you book the holiday . Never usually see housekeeping when Iâ€™m on holiday, but ours only came at 5 every night, we were out of the room at 9  am so that was uncomfortable.The thing is , she didnâ€™t do much in the room anyway and most days we just asked for new towels and to empty  the bins ( to prevent ants). I didnâ€™t like the fact she moped all the rooms with the same bucket of water . Definitely will not go back to this hotel .Such a shame as the hotel is in a great location right next to the beach , and 5 minutes walk to the strip and all the entertainment. The couple of times we ate in the main restaurant, Jackâ€™s , the food was good and this was also the only place we could pay using cash .",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,1

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Wanderer,52,Wandererwrote a review Mar 2018,"We visited hotel Altis for several reasons, we wanted a 5 star outside of the city, with an indoor pool and offering room service, which the Altis Belem provides. It also was rated well on trip advisor, however now reading many of the â€˜averageâ€™ reviews, I have to agree with them.To begin with, I had to make several emails with the reception regarding a transfer from the airport as advertised on the website. The hotel offers a free shuttle which drops off at the chains other city hotels first, or can arrange a private taxi (at additional cost). The emails exchanged were very inconsistent! Some friendly, polite, helpful. Other replies just plain rude, depending on which member of staff decided to respond. Not a great start. Eventually a private taxi was arranged for us and this was great! The driver was professional and friendly and was waiting for us at arrivals. The car was clean and comfortable and had a car seat for our daughter. Only a 20 minute journey. Our bags were given to concierge and we checked in.Upon arrival The hotel isnâ€™t the most pleasing to look at from the outside, very modern and clinical in amongst a historical city but it depends what you are looking for. Check in was quick, we were told the times for breakfast and then we were escorted to our room by a young member of staff. He spent a good 5 minutes offering info about the room...but after heâ€™d left, we realised that he didnâ€™t give us very much useful information at all, and we ended up finding out things for ourselves as the holiday went along. Not great as your paying for a service you donâ€™t realise you have access too...Such as the times for the daily shuttle to Lisbon centre, how to use the lights (still couldnâ€™t figure this out even by the time we left!) bike hire etc. The room does have a room service and spa menu but it wouldâ€™ve been nice to have a welcome letter with some detailed info about hotel services.We had a deluxe room on the second floor overlooking the marina,  due to the design of the hotel some of these rooms are closer to the sea front and some are located at the back overlooking the busy highway, I think these rooms wouldâ€™ve been noisy! Luckily we had been allocated a room closer to the sea and fortunately the floor to ceilings sliding windows were very soundproofed which was great. We could see a lovely sunset (sunrise rooms were the standard balcony rooms on the opposite side). The decor was modern, slightly oriental and the room was huge with a super king bed (if not bigger) seating area and ensuite. There is a tv with lots of channels and movies to rent (10 euros per film! Expensive!) a mini bar which is free on the first evening for Cold drinks and beers. A nespresso machine stocked with 6 complimentary espresso shots daily. The view was stunning (if a little obscured by the â€˜chicâ€™/obtrusive lamp) with wonderful black out electric drapes.  The room was well sound proofed from adjacent rooms but sadly, the furniture in our room was extremely tired, with rips on the chaise, stains on the carpets and scuffs on the table and end of the bed. Even the bed linen was creased! I donâ€™t know if all rooms are the same but We mentioned this to Reception and they offered us a room change the following day, but to a room overlooking the highway! So we politely declined.We arrived on the weekend for 5 days, and the room service was completely inconsistent! Worse over the weekend and improved slightly in the week. When we first arrived our room wasnâ€™t made up until late afternoon and even then my nightwear had been left in a crumpled pile on the side table! Toiletries were not replenished etc. This did improve as the week went along, sometimes housekeeping came-in twice daily and we even got goodnightbiscuits left for us on the last 3 evenings! (This is the kind of 5 star service we were expecting).You are provided with robes and slippers for the spa located in the hotel which is open from morning until evening. The robes were not fluffy at all, and itchy! And the slippers were cheap and uncomfortable. We did use the pool area with our daughter at the allocated â€˜kids hourâ€™ which is just inconvenient as it is during breakfast! Why canâ€™t it be at any other hour in the day?! I would say the spa is just ok, Iâ€™ve been in cleaner, warmer, more luxurious spas. I couldnâ€™t use the sauna as it was out of service on the day I went, and the steam room smelled funny. The cushions on the loungers slide down when you sit on them. I also had a treatment,but I wouldnâ€™t recommend it.The location of the hotel is fabulous. Lots to see in Belem, such as museums and monuments, walks along the sea front,the tropical gardens and nice restaurants. All public transport links with the city within 10 minutes or a taxi is 10 euros. And lots to do there also, in the summer people also recommended visiting Cascais for the beaches, so an all round great location.We used room service, the bar 38 for drinks and also the restaurant which is doubled as the breakfast room (some background music would be nice at breakfast as it is a small room). Lovely fresh flowers in the restaurant. Although service was good, the food was mediocre, both room service and in the restaurant with better eating options in Belem. We didnâ€™t try the Michelin star as we had our young baby with us so I cannot comment.Finally, i accidentally left a purse containing 2 credit cards in a zipped hand luggage bag in the corner of the room for the entire trip. Upon returning home I had a call from my bank with over 30 suspicious transactions on my account from taxi companies in Lisbon and even Estonia, starting on the day I arrived in Lisbon. As I had not even realised my purse was in the bag I had not used it for the entire trip which concludes that unfortunately security within the hotel is questionable, and someone With access to our room during our stay had stolen my credit card information. There is an electronic safe in the room so I would recommend to use it! I did report this to the general manager at the hotel who assured me he would do a full investigation which I feel is necessary!Overall I feel the Altis Belem is overpriced, lacking in attention to detail in most areas, and offers inconsistent service. Having been lucky enough to stay in 5 star hotels all around three world, in comparison We wouldnâ€™t stay here again personally.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,3

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Nick Mowle,0,Nick Mowlewrote a review Aug 2010,"We have just got back from a weeks holiday in Tavira, the town is about 30mins transfer time from Faro airport. The hotel is in a perfect location to the town centre, about a 2 minute walk until you hit the first shops/restaurants etc, also it is very close to the ferry which taxi's you over to Tavira island which is the beach. The hotel is kept very clean and the swimming pool is a very good size. The buffet breakfast is first class and we found that after loading up in the mornings we didn't eat again until the evening. We ate in a differnet restaurant every night, we found the places over the Roman bridge to be the best. A few good bars, Black Anchor Irish Bar, Tavira Lounge, Pink Flamingo. The town is very chilled out and perfect for relaxing, it is not a wild place. This is the place to go for great weather the sky was perfect blue every day and it was really hot.Tip: buys drinks from the local supermarkets a 2 litre bottle of water is 3.5 euros in the hotel, its 60 cents in a supermarket!The only negative is that you are charged 2.5 euros a day for a room safe which is a bit steep!I would definately go back to this hotel but I would love to try the camping on Tavira island as it looks like a great campsite and at 11 euros a night what a bargin!",Aug,2010,Aug 2010,2010-08-01,2010,4

PortoSense,Vaihayasi D,2,Vaihayasi Dwrote a review Nov 2018,"You can't go wrong staying at PortoSense Ribeira. If it is in your budget go for it!We had a lovely stay at a second-floor studio apartment (there is an elevator) at the PortoSense Ribeira on Rua dos Mercadores in the second week of October 2018.It had a small little balcony (see pics) that offered us a sideways view of the Douro river and the town's MAIN waterfront drag. The apartment, located in a historical building, also had a kitchen (see pic), attached bathroom with shower, and a reasonably spacious bedroom-sitting room (see pic).What made our two days at PortoSense Ribeira exceptional was the obsessive perfection with which the apartment had been laid out and equipped. Not one thing was missing and everything had been thoughtfully provided for, including little sachets of soap and softener for the washing machine and dishwasher, and a line to dry clothes.We enjoy cooking and the kitchen was not short of any of the basic implements or requirements. Our very clean bedroom-cum-sitting room was decorated with interesting, elegant furniture in a classic style and it afforded us a comfortable stay. There was free WiFi too.Equally wonderful was that the hotel was right in the most scenic and happening (but not particularly noisy) area of town -- across the water were the town's most famous wineries and the main waterfront square was less than 2 minutes away.A grocery mart that stays open till late was 2 minutes away too and the regular store just across the street. There were restaurants, bars and shops just a stone's throw away. An ATM was right across the street.Everything else, like the main shopping thoroughfares -- Rua Santa Catarina and Rua das Flores -- and sites, were on foot about 10 minutes away. The nearest subway station was also 5 minutes away. Ponte de Dom Luís I bridge was 5 minutes away.We interacted with manager Susana, who was especially helpful and also gave us the most useful sightseeing, dining and shopping tips, which we followed faithfully and had a memorable time in beautiful Porto.PortoSense organises a door to door taxi pick up and drop as well, which is worth it at 11 euros, because when you first arrive in Porto it takes a bit to get your bearings and the roads are steep to negotiate with luggage. The train station is about 10 minutes away by road.We couldn't believe our luck when arrived at PortoSense Ribeiro -- it was just what we wanted. So PortoSense Ribeiro you get a my enthusiastic thumbs up. Five stars, no less.",Nov,2018,Nov 2018,2018-11-01,2018,5
Hotel Principe Lisboa,MariaRPerez,2,MariaRPerezwrote a review Sep 2013,"This hotel is well located, near business center, shopping area and cinemas and underground. It's confortable and has wonderful pillows! Everything was very clean and the temperature satisfatory. Breakfast is good enough, from 7a.m. Parking zone should be bigger.",Sep,2013,Sep 2013,2013-09-01,2013,5
Vila Galé Coimbra,Redlichkeit,92,Redlichkeitwrote a review Jun 2016,"This is a modern, clean, functional hotel that specializes in large tour groups that arrive by the busload.  It also seems to be well located for couples or families arriving by car.  There is an outdoor pool, a spa, and a large restaurant (specializing in buffets).  The distinct downside is that the hotel is located in an ugly peripheral zone about 20 minutes walk from the center of the city.  There are no restaurants (other than the hotel restaurant) nearby and nothing of interest nearby.  There is theoretically air conditioning, but I think it takes particular skill (which I do not have) to make it work. On the other hand, Coimbra does not seem to offer much in the way of hotels.  So this may be the best option.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4
Mareta View Boutique Bed & Breakfast,Miggi1907,95,Miggi1907wrote a review Jun 2017,"We had a very mixed experience at this location. Upon arrival we accidently walked into the Mareta Beach hotel instead of the Mareta View Boutique hotel (same owners). Apparently this was a big mistake from our side since the receptionist there told us in the most unfriendly way that we should have known that they had 3 properties which were called Mareta something, and that we were at the wrong location. Not sure what his problem was but this made us feel extremely unwelcome. Very bad start.When we arrived at the correct property, a bit further down the road, we went to our compact room which was....very compact. Little space to walk around, let alone to unload all your stuff. Luckily the staff was a lot more friendly! Only minus was that the bar was almost never staffed when we were there and when we rang the bell to order, no one came.The beds, the location, the view and the breakfast were all very good. Because of this, we managed to really enjoy our stay in Sagres. But when we left the Mareta View Boutique Hotel, we were not 100% convinced.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,2
Hotel Principe Lisboa,RemyaI,40,RemyaIwrote a review Jun 2014,"We stayed for two nights on our short break in lisbon. What a lovely place.. Big rooms with lovely decor.I was pleasantly surprised with the rooms considering we got the room at considerably low price - great deal!The location could not have been better, it's bang outside the metro station. It takes about 7-10 minutes to the city centre. There is a direct bus to Belem. Arriving from the airport is also very easy.The front desk is very helpful, friendly and speaks good English. They helped us happily on how to commute, which bus to take, where to eat etc.The breakfast has a good variety too..I would definitely recommend this place and would return back.",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,5
HF Fenix Lisboa,n2r2,9,n2r2wrote a review Nov 2014,Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Right next to Metro station - Baixia and Rossi are 15 mins walking distance. Staff very helpful. Room was clean - a bit small though. Breakfast  variety could have been better. Free wi-fi but kept on losing the connection every so often.,Nov,2014,Nov 2014,2014-11-01,2014,4
Vila Camacho Guest House,Kiran P,0,Kiran Pwrote a review Nov 2022,"This is a fantastic hotel in Funchal. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are clean and have everything you need. The breakfast was also very good. On the day we left the hotel early to hike, they packed breakfast for us. The bar and the patio were also very nice to relax at.Travel back from the Funchal marina to the hotel is about a 30 minute uphill walk which may be difficult for some. However, a Bolt taxi is only about 5-10 euros if you don't want to walk.",Nov,2022,Nov 2022,2022-11-01,2022,5

Longroiva Hotel Rural,Fernanda J,7,Fernanda Jwrote a review Jan 2025,"Without saying anything, they saw at the check-in the date of birth and when they verified that it was a birthday they offered a cake, with a vintage, at the end of dinner. The dinner was also very good, with an impeccable service and with some very nice employees.",Jan,2025,Jan 2025,2025-01-01,2025,4
