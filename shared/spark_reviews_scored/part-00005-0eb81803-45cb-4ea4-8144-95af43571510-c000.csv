Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Manon H,60,Manon Hwrote a review Jun 2021,"So yeah, definitely not a 5* hotel but once you process that it’s alright!  Wouldn’t stay again as I think there are better hotels in the Algarve but we struggled to find availability when we were there.  The location is what makes it, the view, there is a fantastic walking trail right from the hotel & Carvoeiro has a lovely feel to it!  The staff were all lovely with us despite reading some reviews which stated otherwise.  The breakfast staff were the only ones who werent warm & friendly like the others.Didn’t eat at the restaurant but breakdown was alright and the pool food was ok too.  The drinks were good though!",Jun,2021,Jun 2021,2021-06-01,2021,3

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Solihullmum,3,Solihullmumwrote a review Jul 2024,"an honest review..::pools- lovely and clean, water slides great fun but life guards not always keeping an eye out (for example there were some kids going down in fours on quite steep slides). considering the amount of guest there are simply not enough parasols provided by the hotel - this then results in people reserving beds from 7am onwards - the hotel could sort this with more parasolsfood- was very good - didn't understand previous reviews saying not hot enough- all the food we had was great as were the drinks.rooms- the balcony situation was not safe really. Heater system on balcony that  a child could climb up on possibly which considering this is a high rise hotel isn't good.the rooms also lacked any decoration which is something that could be improved on. Toiletries were also non branded and not what you would expect of a five star . bedding and bed were also not in line with five star - quite cheap feel to linen and mattresspool towels- never experienced this in a five star before but you can only change your towels between 9am and 12pm . Our towels were moved and when i asked for replacements I got accused by someone on reception of leaving towels on sunbeds too long to reserve them - despite me saying that was absolutely not the case I was spoken to quite rudely by this member of staff who eventually agreed to replace the towels after giving me quite an unnecessary lecture.sky bar - lovely and we really enjoyed this - beautiful views and like the rest of the hotel very cleanlocation- not the best really - one very good restaurant by the hotel called martinique which was amazingoverall not a five star so if you go expecting that you will be disappointed",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,3
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,AmyRosee,0,AmyRoseewrote a review Sep 2025,"We had a great stay and really enjoyed our time in the hotel.The pool entertainment during the day was great for kids but the nighttime shows could be better.Also would recommend some live music inside the hotel bar as this felt like we were just sitting in reception having a drink, there was no atmosphere.Only a short walk to the new town if you wanted a bit of a chance of scenery.Overall the staff were lovely and very accommodating and the food was good too. Would defo recommend",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Alan D,0,Alan Dwrote a review Mar 2022,"My wife and I spent a week at Belmar in February 2022. We had a spacious apartment with a lovely view of the beach (D2F). The resort is comfortable and clean, if a little sterile. But two things stand out.First the standard of housekeeping and maintenance is very high.Second the reception staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. When we got back home I realised that I had foolishly left my car keys in the safety deposit box. I telephoned reception, who immediately found the keys. I sent my card details to cover the cost and Diana went to the post office and organised the return of my keys. I had them back within a week.I feel this was quite remarkable service and done with genuine friendliness,",Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Scott Arnold,13,Scott Arnoldwrote a review Oct 2022,"We arrived here quite late at night, but pleasantly surprised at how friendly and knowledgable the man on the reception was who checked us in. They made us food to take to our room as it was really late even though we had allready declined.The rooms are nice and clean but don’t look out to much.The halls, as mentioned in previous reviews are disgusting.We as a family werent fussed with the food. We ate breakfast, sometime didn’t bother with lunch and most nights ate out for dinner.My opinion of the food is the presentation looks herrendous like slops, most food is bland or tasteless, the meal choices are very repetitive.I honestly can’t see how any one enjoys it.Pool area is great but very slippy.Plenty for kids and adults to do through the day and on an evening the entertainment is decent enough for a bit.The Jet2 rep is a bit like marmite. She does her job but not very forthcoming, we had the zoo marine included in our stay. (Zoo marine opens at 10 and shuts at 5pm) however weren't picked up till 10 and had to be back on the bus at 4pm so lost out on two hours there so everything there seemed like an absolute rush. They email you a letter but don’t think to tell you to get it printed before hand. Also note that we arrived the Thursday night and Friday we just wanted to enjoy the day the Saturday we wanted to book zoo marine to be told it was open Wednesday to Saturday so nearly didn’t get there as we were only there for a week anyway but this wasn’t relayed to us at any point until it was nearly to late.We as a family had a good time there as it is what you make it. We met some great people.I would just think if you are a bit funny with food or have certain tastes I would potentially take extra spending money as the strip is a 10 minute walk to find good food and bars.",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,3
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,AK602020,1,AK602020wrote a review Aug 2024,If you are travelling with the family this hotel has everything you need to keep the children entertained. The main pools were very busy with things for the children and the slides were great fun. The quiet pool was a welcome break from the busy areas. Food was excellent and everywhere was very clean. We had a junior suite and a standard room with pool view both of which were of a good size. Not very close to the beach however there was a free shuttle bus which ran regularly. A great family week away.,Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,5
Pestana Vila Lido,Jiil H,2,Jiil Hwrote a review Dec 2024,You were received by nice and friendly staff.

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,angie_herrerar,7,angie_herrerarwrote a review Oct 2020,"This is the fourth hotel we came to as part of two weeks holiday in Madeira. I have to say I had bigger expectations. The good things: the location and views are amazing, and the staff is nice. However, the rooms are not in the best condition (at list not ours). The bathroom doesn't look very clean and some furniture is old and broken. The breakfast is poorly organised under the covid restrictions (we have been into three other hotels and it worked really well). It took us 20 minutes just to get coffee and juice, and we could see many tables waiting for food. The food is ok but not great.",Oct,2020,Oct 2020,2020-10-01,2020,3

Coffee and coffee maker available in the room. Wonderful shower!! Pay special attention to bathroom amenities, such as body lotion, soap, shampoo and conditioner of extreme quality (I even bought it and brought it to Brazil) because it is so wonderful! The highlight was the breakfast, simply fantastic, very complete! The staff is also amazing, always friendly, friendly and very helpful. We have nothing but praise for this hotel!

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Charlotte L,11,Charlotte Lwrote a review Nov 2019,"The hotel was so lovely and clean, really nicely decorated and a perfect atmosphere. We stayed for three nights and arrived to find custard tarts and small bottles of port in our rooms as a welcome. Really lovely. We ate in the hotel which was absolutely delicious. We did have a noisy room on the road side of the first floor -  I am a very light  sleeper and so I didn't sleep so well. We asked reception the next day if there was any other rooms available and they were very helpful and friendly. Luckily they did have a room on the third floor square side with fantastic views of the castle, and much quieter. Thank you so much as it really made all the difference. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. Breakfast was also superb!!",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,5

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Graeme B,4,Graeme Bwrote a review Mar 2015,This was our 5th visit and as always we received a very friendly welcome. The service was first class - the staff are unfailingly polite and courteous. The refurbishment of the rooms is very impressive and has been done in a stylish and sympathetic way with the result that the hotel has lost none of its charm or atmosphere. The San Lorenzo Golf course remains our favourite course on the Algarve. Looking forward already to February 2016! GJB,Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,5

Lisbon Destination Hostel,Nathalie G,3,Nathalie Gwrote a review Nov 2011,"Stay  four nights at the Rossio Patio hostel and had a fantastic time. This hostel brings hosteling to a whole new level.. it is a luxury hostel but with hostel hospitality and prices! The open concept lounge and kithcen are just amazing with tonnes of plants and natural sunlight. This is a new hostel so everything is brand new.The owners (Dangolia and Joao) are superbe people who go out of their way. The staff  are super friendly and interested in helping you out with the little details. For example, I came in from the rain and they offered me a hair blower and when we needed to dry our clothing, brought us a rack to hang out clothes to dry. It is just amazing and the location is just perfect!!",Nov,2011,Nov 2011,2011-11-01,2011,5
1908 Lisboa Hotel,stephen b,80,stephen bwrote a review May 2017,"We booked last minute and what a find! The best check in we have every had world wide! (Ana da Silva ) I am sure once others find out about this hotel which was opened in February this year that we won't find it easy to book anymore ☹️ it's placed a good five mins walk from down town but trust me that's a positive, you can travel so many ways in Lisbon the metro (underground) is a few meters away from hotel which I must say is the best way to get to this hotel from the airport it's so super easy! And very cheap! This hotel is small but perfect in every way, you have everything you need and it's so modern and cool with people who connect with you not as you would in other hotels, to explain this both my wife and Ana on reception where in tears as we left today! I must also mention a special lady in the restaurant she is called marianer, this girl connects genuinely with you giving not only a fantastic service but fun and intelligent conversation.To sum up this elegant super modern super friendly hotel would be my only choice when we return period!",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,5

The rooms are cleaned regularly and the pool area is nice .Overall we had a great time .If I had a slight problem it would be that everything is geared for French tourists and most entertainment is in french .,Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,RVA-Flaneur,83,RVA-Flaneurwrote a review Jan 2017,"Marriott/SPG Gold with roughly 60 hotel nights annually...This is a decent Marriott, but I wasn't blown away.Pros- Relatively modern with solid upkeep.- Comfortable bed.- Good breakfast, with an omelette station and very efficient waitstaff.- Executive lounge with complimentary beer/wine and hors d'ouvres in the evening.- Quiet part of town.Cons- Off the beaten path, with no restaurants/cafes nearby (though taxis are cheap).- Food prices seemed very high.- A good 20-minute (uphill) walk from the nearest Metro stop, with bumpy (and slippery when wet) tile path all the way up - it's sure to do a number on the wheels of your roller bag and I'd recommend a taxi to get here.- Room was pretty standard. Doubt I received an upgrade (and I didn't note an Executive/Marriott Preferred floor (lounge is off the lobby).- Painfully slow Internet. It claimed I was getting 'Enhanced Internet' but if this was enhanced, I'd hate to see the Normal! Reminded me of a 128kb copper wire connection from 15-20 years ago!- Carpet in my room needed a thorough cleaning!- A room service tray sat out in the hall near my room for 6+ hours without being collected.Be forewarned...the property seems to be on the tour bus circuit, so you can end up with dozens of people swarming in/out at odd hours, slamming doors, propping doors open and visiting 'neighbors,' etc. I even heard a dog barking incessantly one evening.",Jan,2017,Jan 2017,2017-01-01,2017,4

Casa Mitchell Apartments,cas11,54,cas11wrote a review May 2017,"Given that Casa Mitchell is just few minutes walk from the hectic and noisy old town square, it is incredibly quiet and peaceful once you get to your apartment. All the apartments are fully equipped with all the necessary appliances and cooking utensils. There is a small supermarket next door and a bigger one just 5 minutes walk along Rua Sir Richard Cliff (yes a street named after him). The apartment are spacious with a lounge, dining area  / double and single bedrooms, bathroom and balcony.On the ground floor is the swimming pool which also opened to guests staying at Vila Branca.The beach and the old town square are also within 5 minutes walk.All in all Casa Mitchell is a very nice clean, comfortable and peaceful place to unwind after a hectic night out in town.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,5

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Rich U,2,Rich Uwrote a review Oct 2018,"Booked  here for three nights initially but on realising how special this hotel and surrounding area is we quickly extended our stay for another night! The whole experience was perfect from the start, after arriving late at night we received a very friendly and informative welcome with a personal guided tour of the hotel from Jorge who works in reception who also took our luggage from the car to the rooms. Everything about this hotel oozes quality but without being too pretentious, the rooms (sea view) were on the third floor below the reception level but had the most fantastic view of the bay and sea. The breakfast quality and choice was the best I have ever experienced in any similar sized hotel, the staff are efficient and friendly stopping to take photos and answer any questions, the omelete chef at breakfast is very good as well as being entertaining!  The rooms have a Nespresso machine provided to make coffee and tea and the bar staff helped out with extra milk. The hotel is very cleverly built into the cliff which makes it blend into the landscape, the small and very pleasant town of Carvoeiro with a lovely beach is only 15 min walk away and there is another beach a similar distance (Centeanes) in the other direction which has a decent restaurant where you can watch the sunset.The most memorable part of this stay though has to be the breathtaking location and view of the bay which draws you in every time you walk by the reception area. Overall a perfect place for a relaxing stay in this beautiful part of the world. We will be back.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,5

Solar dos Poetas,Nicole T,20,Nicole Twrote a review Oct 2024,"I had such a wonderful experience at this hotel. There was a nice, local cherry brandy (I believe it was brandy?) upon checking in. They disclaimed that my room might feel small, but for a solo traveler, it was the right size. The desk by the window, the rainfall + detachable shower heads. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The public space for breakfast was beautiful and a big breakfast itself was delicious. I especially enjoyed the location and decor of books/writings everywhere.A huge plus was their staff. While check-out was at 11 AM, my flight was significantly delayed (late PM) and I worried about where to store my luggage for so long. Without hesitation, they held my luggage for as long as I needed and invited me to spend time in the public spaces to feel comfortable.I'd stay here again and cannot sing their praises enough.",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,5

O Castelo Guest House,Eduardoamo,21,Eduardoamowrote a review Nov 2013,"We did not have a booking and found o O Castelo Guess House on the lonely planet book - what a lucky day. Only one room available and the one with a beach view!!!!Upon arrival, the staff efficiently check us in and helped us with our big and heavy luggages to go down the stairs. The room was spotless!!! There was a self-contained kitchen, large bathroom and the bedroom was big enough but the best was outside - the view from the balcony was a portrait. The blue ocean, the cliffs and the village... one could sit there for hours enjoying the view while drinking a good portuguese wine or beer.Later on the day, we had the opportunity to meet the owner - such a gentleman.It was such a shame we were there for one night only.Needless to say that I highly recommend O Castelo and cannot wait to go back there.",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,1

Every morning between the hours of 2-5am we would be woken by shouting, aggressive swearing and just football hooligan type behaviourâ€¦â€¦.total disregard to other guests in the hotel.On a positive note the staff are great and Pierre cannot do enough for you and appreciated our concerns during our stay.If youâ€™re a group of lads looking to book a hotel for your Albufeira holiday then itâ€™s ideal for you but if youâ€™re a family then stay well clear as there are plenty of better hotels in the area.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Saffron M,1,Saffron Mwrote a review Aug 2016,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Vilamoura for a very restful week of sunbathing, swimming and relaxing and it suited these purposes perfectly. The kids loved the pool, lounge, gym and spa and it had direct beach access which was fantastic. The room was rather on the small side but we were never in it except to sleep. You have to be down by the pool before 8am to reserve a lounger, before they are nabbed by guests, but I'm usually up before 7am so this wasn't a problem. My son cut his foot 3 times in the pool quite badly and was told by staff he could not swim for two of the days we were there as the cuts were so deep, which was unfortunate for him and ruined his fun a bit. I hope the hotel take responsibility for this health and safety problem and check the ruling and safety in the pool regularly. The buffet breakfast and dinner were fabulous, great choice of food and beautifully presented. The staff were amazing and really aimed to please. The Marina is 10 minutes away with restaurants, bars and boutiques and the golf is a 10 minute drive. A very safe family friendly environment. Would go back for a restful week or two as we had a great time.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4
Natura Algarve Club,essexfamily3,11,essexfamily3wrote a review Aug 2017,"Arrived here in the morning but couldn't check into our room until 3pm, however there is a room we could leave our luggage and we were able to use the pool whilst we waited!The apartments are great, very spacious and cleaned everyday, with a nice big balcony too, no complaints there!The pool area is great, we loved the space and how quiet it was even at peak time in August! Never had to go down early to do the towels on the sunbed routine, some days we didn't go to the pool until about 10.30am and there were still sun beds free, amazing!It is a good location, about 10-15 walk to the strip and the beach, and about a 40 mins walk to the old town. We found the best beach to be the Praia Balaia which is a left turn from the roundabout by the Chinese, the sea is warmer and shallower and much better for kids!We had no problems at all with the couple of hen and stag parties that were there, we didn't see any sign of behaviour others have mentioned and would recommend this accommodation to everyone!",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4

Ocean Gardens,Linsie K,2,Linsie Kwrote a review Nov 2016,"The Ocean Gardens hotel is a beautiful hotel in Funchal. All rooms overlook the Atlantic Ocean and the views are stunning. The cleanliness of the rooms and hotel in general cannot be faulted. The swimming pool and surrounding areas are also very well kept. Just one complaint (and it's a personal one really): the rooms do not have tea and coffee making facilities and the beds are rock hard. Also, you have to rely on the free hotel bus or public transport busses to take you into the city, the roads are quite windy to walk along them safely. However, the hotel was ideal for what we wanted which was to rest.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,4

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Chris B,168,Chris Bwrote a review Aug 2013,"The hotel was very clean with excellent spa facilities such as indoor pool and Jacuzzi (free of charge at this point).  Breakfast had a great deal of choice cereals, juices cooked, continental, fresh eggs and pancakes, differing breads and lots of fruit. Tavira is a great place unless you want benidormesque trad beer chips and discos which we do not :).  It is quite charming with a nice central square, gardens and pretty bridges. Lots of winding streets over the bridges hide numerous little restaurants & cafes.  Camera obscura, castle and churches a good to visit.  A must is either local beach via ferry under 2 euros and less than 8 mins or water taxi to cabanas beach 30 each way for boat (holds 10).",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,4

The problem is that it doesn’t have a drive way so you need to park on the sidewalk to get your luggage out. If you are bringing a car reserve a parking spot ahead of time because they have very limited parking. Only 1 or 2 at the front desk know how to answer your questions, the rest are a bit under informed. The room had a missing shower door in the bathroom. The a/c didn’t really cool down the room. It is a bit of a walk to the attractions.",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,3

Yes! Lisbon Hostel,Azurejourn,9,Azurejournwrote a review Nov 2015,"I've stayed at a fair number of hostels across Europe now and this hostel in Lisbon is one of the best on my travels.  It would be better than many of the budget hotels there across multiple criteria.The location is brilliant: it's immensely convenient for backpackers.  It is close to one of the main metro stations (Baixa/Chiado) and less than a 10-minute walk to Rossio Square and PraÃ§a da Figueira, which have important transport links for day trips such as Belem.  The city is very walkable from the hostel as it is so centrally placed.The rooms are modern and comfortable.  The beds offer a surprising amount of privacy because they are quite 'deep' and have good curtains across the side of the bunk.  I had a great quality of sleep and the curtains can hide the stumbles and light shone by late-night visitors in the dorm.  Communal areas and shared bathrooms were clean.  There is nice cosy furniture and great atmosphere in the main communal area on the ground floor!I definitely recommend the hostel's cheap four-course dinner; I've not seen hostels offer anything like it in other European cities.  The sangria top-ups with the dinner were great.  The free breakfast is also good.The staff here are so welcoming and friendly!  I had great banter at the bar.  I was organising this trip in a group and we had a payment issue for the group reservation but they were nice enough to let us pay on arrival.  I recommend the hostel's free walking tour, though I did not go on the pub crawl as our group had its own adventures in Bairro Alto.I cannot really fault this hostel.  The only niggle was that a significant number of people across the hostel did not know their allocated beds (I noticed a funny passive-aggressive handwritten note at the bar on this issue!).",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4
Legendary Lisboa Suites,Buddleja_11,82,Buddleja_11wrote a review Feb 2013,"The Clarion Suites hotel is equidistant from Rato and Marques de Pombal, forty minutes from the airport and about fifteen minutes from the centre of Lisbon by metro.  Our suite consisted of a large bedroom with plenty of wardrobe space, a well-equipped bathroom and a living room with a kitchenette.  Twice a much space as in most hotel rooms and very luxurious.  The beds were extremely comfortable and there is a television in each room.  On the downside you will be charged for everything in the fridge, including the bottled water, although tea bags and coffee sachets are free.  Also beware of the thin bedding and rescue the blanket from the wardrobe if you are there in winter.  The staff are friendly and helpful, they give you a map and look after your bags after checkout.",Feb,2013,Feb 2013,2013-02-01,2013,4
Mareta View Boutique Bed & Breakfast,Jenny117,24,Jenny117wrote a review Jul 2011,"We stayed for 7 nights in a sea view balcony room. The staff were welcoming and friendly and all speak excellent english. They responded immediately to any requests we had and were always on hand to answer questions or chat or make us a cocktail in the afternoon. The room was minimal, spotlessly clean with lovely crisp linen and a large comfortable double bed. There's a fridge but no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but you can easily nip downstairs for tea or coffee and bring it back up to drink on the balcony. The bathroom was compact but perfectly adequate and the shower powerful with lots of hot water. There is aircon which it is advisable to use at night - it's lovely to sleep with the doors to the balcony open, listening to the sea, but you'll provide a feast for the mosquitoes and regret it the next day. Breakfast is served buffet style with fruit, bread, cheese, cold meats and delicious traditional cakes and sweets ...custard tarts...mmm.. ..fruit juice and as much coffee as you want. There is a terrace on which to sit and watch the sun climb in the azure sky - there's no better way to start the day.The Mareta View has a garden with sun beds and palm trees and a small jaccuzi. Set above the beach there is always a cool breeze and enough shade to sit and read a book or snooze.The area around the Mareta View is the quiet end of Sagres - although there doesn't seem to be a noisy end really - there are numerous cafes and restaurants - many within walking distance or others a short drive. We ate in a different great place every evening. Especially recommended are Tonel Beach Cafe - Michelle is half English and half Portugese - she serves delicious homemade burgers and toasties all amazingly cooked up in what amounts to a shack on the small secluded beach just  along from the fort where bikers and surfers hang out. They close at 7pm so Michelle recommended the restaurant on Zavial beach for our evening meal and she was right - we had a fantastic last evening meal on a large terrace overlooking a deserted pristine sandy beach as the sun went down.Sagres is a perfect get away from it all destination if you want peace and quiet and you like your sun with a cooling breeze. The sea is too cold to swim in without a wetsuit unless you're made of sterner stuff than us, but the trade off is the magnificence of the waves coming in off the Atlantic, which personally I could sit and watch all day.There is a small supermarket within walking distance and the larger Intermarche on the road coming into Sagres from Faro where you can get everything from food to toiletries to nice wines and spirits and the daily paper. With a car you can explore up the coast through the Parque Natural - there are beautiful beaches like the one at Borderia - completely worth the hike across the small river from the car park. The sandy beach is huge - no chance of overcrowding here. Make sure you call in at the Micro Bar in Carrapateira for a stunning burger with milkshake or delicious looking things on toast - but leave room for one of the fabby puddings in the chiller cabinet.If you're looking for night life or shopping or huge amounts of culture, this really isn't the place for you. If you want to relax, eat well, do a spot of people watching and let it all hang out, head for Mareta View - we loved it.",Jul,2011,Jul 2011,2011-07-01,2011,4

ibis Styles Lisboa Centro Liberdade NE,Albert,285,Albertwrote a review Nov 2024,"I liked my 2-night stay at the hotel a lot, which was a surprise for me, to be honest, because my expectations for the ibis brand were pretty low, knowing that hotels of this brand are usually very basic. First of all, the hotel has a great location in a nice and pretty quiet area of Lisbon, not far from the historic center. The walk to the center is around 20 minutes. Plus, this location is perfect if you want easy access to the airport, as you can avoid a lot of traffic without entering the typical narrow Lisbon Old City streets.The hotel is generally remodeled. It was spotlessly clean every day of my stay. A day before my check-in, I requested an early room preparation, and finally I was allowed to check in an hour early. All the front desk staff were friendly and nice to me. I have to mention the small elevator, which could barely fit me and my 2 pieces of luggage, and was a bit slow.I got a nice room with 1 double bed. I liked its basic but cute design. The room was an average medium size, but I felt comfortable there. All the furniture was in very good condition. The bed was comfortable. There was a small refrigerator, which was a plus. Even though my room was on the second floor, it was well soundproofed. I heard almost no noise from the street or the hallway. As for the room’s downsides, I can mention there weren’t many hangers in the closet. Another downside was the bathroom size, which was very tiny. Everything there was basically right next to each other. But, luckily, the shower stall was big enough, and I felt comfortable showering. The bathroom amenities were of good quality and smelled nice. The Wi-Fi worked fast.The biggest downside of my stay was the price I paid - €167 per night. I find this very overpriced, knowing the typical hotel prices in Lisbon, as I travel to this city every year. The nightly rate for this ibis should be about 1/3 of the rate I paid. This was the only thing that bothered me about the hotel. Meanwhile, I was generally happy with my stay, and I can totally recommend this hotel for your vacation in Lisbon or a business trip.",Nov,2024,Nov 2024,2024-11-01,2024,4
