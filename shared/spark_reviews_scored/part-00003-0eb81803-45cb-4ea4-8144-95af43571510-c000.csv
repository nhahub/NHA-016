Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Holandesa,39,Holandesawrote a review Jun 2014,"Pro's:+ The food at the restaurant. Although they have limited options, the food was delicious. The Spaghetti Bolognese was great! The food is also affordable. If you want to vary, try one of the restaurant on the beach (the one on the left side of the hotel is great! Forgot its' name, but it's not Antonio's) You can also order room service at the hotel, but if you pick up the food yourself at the restaurant (to eat in your apt) you save (i think) 5€. As we did this quite often (we have small kids) we saved the additional costs. We enjoyed eating at the apt as it is well equipped and we didn't have to worry about the kids.+ The 2 bedroom apartment was spacious and well designed. We were in the C block and had a great sea & beach view.+ The service: reception & restaurant employees were friendly and helpful.+ Location is relax - not close to the center. It's for people who want to relax and enjoy the beach (our case). If you want a busy nightlife, you should consider other accommodation.+ Furthermore, I had some problems with the reservation which would have financial impact on our side. Lana Martins helped me solving the problem. She was very attentive and helpful. She also replied the e-mails on quickly and offered great customer service. I'm sure that if it wasn't for her, my experience would be less positive and wouldn't consider going back.Con's:- Swimmingpools outside are lovely, but too cold.  (it could be that in August is it warmer?)- Did not see playground or a game room for kid for kids.In short: we had a great time! Loved Lagos, the beaches, the food and the accommodation. We would consider going back for sure!",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,4
Artbeat Rooms,Andreas J,0,Andreas Jwrote a review Sep 2016,It was our second time at artbeat. A perfect location in that beautiful city. The two host Gosia&Gosia See so nice and helpful. With check-in you get a self-created map of Lisbon with all their recommendations where to eat eg. This was very helpful and minimise the risk to get to an tourist-nap-restaurant. We will definately return.,Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,5

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,broncoal06,91,broncoal06wrote a review Oct 2022,"There's a part of me that wants to give this a 5/5, but there are certain things that won't let me do that.The reasons why this wasn't a perfect stay:-Booked a family deluxe room and were led to believe that they had sea views. They do not. This really made us feel like we overpaid significantly for this place.-Front desk staff act unapproachable and snooty, not too helpful.-Inconsistencies with breakfast staff on whether food items can be taken back to room (I had an ill wife who was too sick to be in the restaurant. First day, I was allowed to take a tray back, every other day, was not).Here's what went well:-Room quality was still very nice.-Room service food was the best we've ever had anywhere, and prices were actually reasonable.-Staff at pool, room service and housekeeping were extraordinarily friendly. These people (especially pool bar attendant Ricardo and room service delivery team member Carlos) saved the stay for us.-Great location.So yes, I have mixed feelings about our stay here. It might be a place I'd try again in the future if there's a sale or it's not high season. But there are definite areas for improvement.",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Joe K,54,Joe Kwrote a review Apr 2025,"What a fabulous family hotel.I've just returned from a week long family holiday with grandparents, parents and children- 18 of us in total, including 9 children from 4 to 12. Jupiter Albufeira was the perfect choice.We booked all rooms direct with the hotel and were given a complimentary mini-bar, topped up daily. The rooms are all absolutely fantastic. Beautiful large modern rooms, good sized bathrooms and lovely walk in overhead showers. The rooms were cleaned daily and all towels replaced daily (although I'd have been happy if they were only changed every other day).The cleanliness and upkeep of the hotel is brilliant, with staff working around the clock to keep the place clean and tidy.The highlight of the hotel is the food. The main dining restaurant, whilst quite canteeny in appearance with tables all clinically in a straight line, is brilliant. Yes, it's busy at times and we saw the odd queue forming with people waiting to get in and to a table, however we just had another drink at the bar before the queue disappeared. The food and selection of food is brilliant.Breakfast has a main station packed full of fresh sliced fruits (the fresh slides oranges were insane), cheeses, hams, yogurts, cereal, pancakes, fruit juices, honey from a dripping honeycomb, breads, pastries and cakes. There is then a hot station where you can get a full english, with various types of eggs on offer, and also hot porridge (I heard it was brilliant).Lunch and dinner has a large array of fresh salad items and mixed salads (think waldorf salad, pasta salads, potato salads, bean salads) which change daily and lots salad dressings and fresh bread. The hot station always has at least 2 types of fresh fish and lots of meat options available. There is also a veggie section at meal sittings with numerous hot options. Each evening there is also a theme section- I think we had Portugese, Asian, Mexican, Surf and Turf, among others. At lunch and dinner you could get beer and wine served at the table, however we tended to just walk up to the bar and pour a red, white or sparkling ourselves when passing. All wines in the hotel are bottled. All the kids in our company are brilliant eaters, so they tended to eat a bot of everything, however there was a kids section with chicken nuggets and chips if sardines, salmon and prawns isn't their thing. There was also a brilliant Italian section in the restaurant that made pizza and pasta to order from about 3/4pm.As we booked direct with the hotel we also had the opportunity to visit to of the hotels other restaurants free of charge- a Brazilian Rodizio and the a-la-carts. Both were absolutely brilliant and well recommended.The staff in the hotel were brilliant. Always smiling and helpful. They are all a credit to the hotel.Whilst the weather wasn't the best, we had 9 very active children with us, none of whom were bored for a minute. With the weather not being the best the kids didn't go near the pool much, however they had endless fun going up and down the water slides, whilst also spending a huge amount of time in the all weather sports court playing football and basketball. There was always a huge crowd of boys and girls of all nationalities playing together and making friends.Next to the football pitch there was a good wee bar area that was a help yourself beer, cider and sangria. The bar also had a fridge packed with fresh sandwiches and pasta pots you could help yourself to throughout the day, whilst you could also get ice-cream and crisps in here for the kids.I visited the gym several times and it is a very very well equipped gym with everything from running, cycling and rowing machines, to weights, free weights and warm up area.If you are looking for a nice family holiday, I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Samantha K,77,Samantha Kwrote a review Nov 2015,"We spent 5 days in a three bedroom condo.  The condo was spacious, clean, and very comfortable for our family.  We each had a balcony off our rooms and two bathrooms to share.  We did not have the best views but we were still happy with our condo. We only had cleaning once and had to ask for more soap and toilet paper from the front desk which they provided for us.  We washed our own towels in the washing machine provided.  It would have been nice to have more regular cleaning but not a big deal.    There were three pools to choose from, a gym, spa and easy 5 min walk to another beautiful beach.  The spa and gym was a great feature to have and the yoga class was awesome.  The nearby beach was beautiful to walk on but the ocean is too cold to swim in for my taste.  Having the large outdoor pool was great as the days were very warm.    We had a car so that we could drive to nearby Sagres to do some surfing.  We were 10 minutes drive from Lagos where we enjoyed many restaurants including great Chinese food, seafood and Italian food.  The concierge made reservations for us everyday.  The town was very cool to walk around in.   Besides surfing we enjoyed horseback riding, wandering around town, and took a boat trip to see the beautiful coast and grottos (I recommend smaller boats).  We ate breakfast and lunches at the hotel.  Lunch was very good.  Breakfast was okay and got a little busy.  You had to wait in line for coffee which could be annoying.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4
Saccharum,Debbie I,1,Debbie Iwrote a review Sep 2015,"The hotel is right on the beach and we had a sea view room with fantastic views.  The room was absolutely outstanding with plenty of room for hanging clothing, a walk in shower, which was lovely, a safe and fridge.  The first thing that you notice when you go into the room is the size of the double bed, huge and very comfy. It was all very clean and room service come in every day to clean and make up the bed. We stayed on half board basis and I have to say the food was very good and most tastes we catered for.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4

Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,Discover672998,46,Discover672998wrote a review Sep 2017,"Great location, beautiful views but the hotel itself could be better for the price they charge. The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated. The restaurant is very average and expensive. The vegetarian option was essentially an egg and a stuffed tomato with salad which while nice was certainly not worth 46€. At breakfast the the staff were slow to take orders from our table for hot food. The wine is super as is the tour of the vineyard. The service is good but was not remarkable. Overall for the price we paid I certainly didn't think it was worth it but I did enjoy my stay none the less.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,3

The pool was a great miss but if your a golfer it's not the end of the day staff and management did their utmost to make the holiday a success even providing extra relaxation areas in the gardens and many more extras to make our stay first class .Given the conditions the staff have at present they are to be commended always putting the guest first.,May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Jean-and-Roger,2,Jean-and-Rogerwrote a review Oct 2018,"Have just returned from the worst 5 day holiday break ever. The pool area was blasted with very loud Techno style music non stop and unavoidable anywhere in the pool area due to 2 large speakers mounted on the bar shed. For a supposed 5 star resort it was unacceptable and if the barman was asked to turn it down he sometimes did - temporarily.  We stay at other 5 star resorts and they wouldn't dream of submitting their customers to this sort of music,in fact none that we visit have any intrusion in the pool area. We have just spoken to a friend who is still there who said that after someone complained to the manageress the music was stopped for 2 days but has now restarted. They're there for 2 weeks, best of luck to them. So if you want a relaxing quiet holiday go somewhere else.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,1

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Sheryl C,0,Sheryl Cwrote a review Jul 2019,"This is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location with stellar staff.  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and accommodating.  The staff made you feel welcome and at home from the second you walked through the door.Crystelle, at front desk, was extremely nice and helpful.  She made dinner reservations for us and helped us plan our daily activities.  She always greeted us with a smile and we loved chatting with her.The restaurant/bar/garden area on the lower level is absolutely delightful (as is the adjoining reading room).  The dining/patio area provides a very comfortable space for breakfast.  The breakfast buffet consisted of meats and cheeses, fresh fruits, cereals, yogurt and baked goods.  Several fresh juice options were available each day.  And you also have the option to order hot dishes like eggs or pancakes, which are made to order.  It is also a lovely space to sit with a cocktail in the afternoon and unwind from a day spent exploring the city.  Finally, they host live music several nights a week – which also make this an excellent spot to go after dinner.Mario, the bar manager, was wonderful.  He was so very friendly and passionate about mixology.  He shared some fabulous cocktail recipes with my husband (who fancies himself a mixologist).  He and the entire bar staff checked on us constantly to ensure that we were content.The basic room is not huge but it is very comfortable.  It has a great bathroom with a wonderful shower. The bed is very comfortable and there’s plenty of closet and dresser space available.  They provide every guest with a cell phone to use during their stay.  While we did not use the phone, we nevertheless thought that this was a lovely touch.  There are also additional nice touches, like leaving fresh fruit in our room on the day of our arrival, as well as cookies each night at turndown service.All in all, we loved our time at Valverde and hope to visit again someday soon.  Thanks for an excellent stay.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,5

Luna Clube Oceano,Nicola S,15,Nicola Swrote a review Feb 2015,"This was our first time visiting Portugal. Have booked to go back this June but not to this hotel! Clubs oceano hotel was a massive let down. On arrival we were given a ground floor, self catering apartment. There was blood spattered on one of the walls; hair ( as in a clump that  you would pull off from your brush) sat beside the tv. Coffee rings on all of the work surfaces. Mould on the prints/pictures on the walls. The pool had a slick of sun cream/ oil on the surface, so you ended up coming out of the pool with more protection, than when you went in! Better use of the shower maybe, before entering.We pointed out our room issue immediately and was offered an equally tired looking room - minus the blood spatters!The staff were friendly but this just wasn't good enough after such a bad start.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,1

About 30 minutes later, room service came to our room with fresh egg custards and a bottle of ruby port - on the house - to congratulate us.  One of the bellmen made sure to tell our cab driver exactly where to take us in downtown Lisbon so we could see the best of the city and shop.  They helped us get a reservation at a great restaurant for our anniversary dinner.  Would definitely stay here again because of the attentiveness of the staff.

Pool area is sweet, with a little cozy area that you can chill in the shade if you wish, Reception is across the road but the people are lovely. Carla and the other chap are so friendly and helpful. You cant fault them.Wifi is a bit hit and miss in some of the rooms. We either had to sit on the toilet to get it in our room or just go to the pool area.Cleaning was a bit of a let down. We stayed for 2 weeks but the cleaners only came in 3 times, although we did have absolutely everything needed for a self contained holiday. The rooms had air con, so this is a plus.

It's clean, the people who work there are really friendly and organise things for everyone to do, the food is great, there's a pool, and best of all, it's super sociable and fun! It felt like one big happy family as everyone goes for dinner, to bars, surfing together, and the hostel also organises things like BBQs and pool parties.I did 3 days of surfing, which I felt was a good amount over a week, as it meant I could relax and explore Lagos' beautiful beaches on the other days. The surf school instructors are great and I really enjoyed my first surfing experience.Don't worry about staying here on your own as you will make friends straightaway! I remember seeing a review from another girl saying that if you are even thinking about going, just do it! And I couldn't agree more; I'm so glad I went.

Royal Savoy Hotel,PFJW,3,PFJWwrote a review May 2019,"Fully booked hotel. Expected our room to have a sea view (as website had suggested). Put in a ground floor room with a view of shrubbery and little else.First day was spent trying to get the room ‘working’. Air conditioning was not cooling the air, toilet extractor wasn’t, odd smell of urine at entrance to room, Wi-fi didn’t reach as far as our dark and dingy room. Asked for another room but was told hotel full.Evening 3, just after getting to sleep we were awoken by a loud noise from above ceiling level - thought an air conditioning pipe had come loose. Maintenance came quickly to sort the problem. Turns out it was a ventilation pipe that came on at various times to vent somewhere or other. After 30 minutes it stopped. Maintenance pointed out the odd smell at the entrance to the room (now stronger since the vent pipe had vented). Telephone reception and demanded we be allocated another room the next day. Once more told that the hotel was full.Moved the next to a room that was just what we had expected when booking. Suggested our old room needed sorting before letting other use it - certainly not fit in our view. Told the room was being reallocated straight away as hotel full.The rest of our stay was pleasant, although we noticed lots of large cracks in plaster work throughout the hotel. On last day parents with children  began to takeover the main pool. Even after official evening closure they returned and could be seen and heard with large balls / floats playing till late.Won’t be returning ever!",May,2019,May 2019,2019-05-01,2019,2

The site is a little tired and could do with new management who might tidy it up a bit. Maybe a light bright reception area and some attention to fittings around the site.All in all a good site, laid back, just a short walk to Albufeira town, maybe 15 minutes. Very good supermarket just down the road. The on site restaurant has new management, they are very friendly and the food is good.There are many 'residents' who live in small park areas around the site, they help give the site some life as the site only has around 30 touring caravans and motorhomes otherwise in November.Make sure you go to Albufiera shopping centre, it is about 5/10 minutes from the site on the Lagos road, the food hall has a good chinese buffett.This is a good camping site which is dearer than the Aire up the road but has free wifi, security at night and a bar/restaurant.

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",lolongan,211,lolonganwrote a review Aug 2017,"Reid's is a great palace exulting with vintage charm, but also nicely renovated. The estate is built on a stiff cliff, with a magnificent view over the deep blue ocean, with Funchal hills on the left. Be sure to ask for a room with sea view. Mine is in the recent wing, a little bit small to my taste, but with a nice terrace looking over the sea. Wifi is very good, rapid. Non alcoholic beverages in room are complementary but surprisingly there is no coffee or tea offered !The pool area is very pleasant, impeccable grass, boasting 2 classic pools, of which one filled with salty water. Pool service is OK, but I would appreciate more if it had been accompanied with small signs of attention such as, but not limited to, fresh towel, fresh fruit slices, ice cream... which I always experienced in other resorts I visited. There is also a sundeck and another small pool at sea level, from where you can plunge down into the sea. The hotel garden is also very beautiful and relaxing, plenty of flowers and exotic trees and plants.The Reid's has 2 restaurants, one named Villa Cipriani serving decent italian food and the other named William serving excellent and very innovative cuisine - it is Michelin-starred recently. And I forget the delightful bar lounge terrace where you can take a mid-afternoon tea break, while contemplating the seascape.The hotel has also spa and fitness facilities but I have not tested them.Service is OK in general, up to the standard of the hotel, although I have noticed that some staff are grumpy and not entirely friendly.All in all I would recommend this hotel if you visit Madeira and Funchal.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4

Sound isolation is good and we slept very well our nights in good bed. Internet connection worked fine, as well as showers with excellent water pressure.Buffet breakfast was ok although maybe a small disappointment to us. We typically try to choose hotels with many-sided buffet breakfast included to room price. This time selection was quite far away from top of our ranking and especially choice of warm dishes was very limited.

There is a unique mix of tradition and modern amenities, with everything you need and want: breathtaking view, outstanding service, excellent food in restaurant \"William\", lovely public areas, a suberb tea terrace, and tremendous personality. Any downs? Well, not really. Still, the bathrooms, more specifically the showers, could definitely do with some renovation. Apart from that, Reid's should remain Reid's, keeping its soul and old world charm, as I am confident the owners know. I will be back.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,3

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Liverbird10_10,2,Liverbird10_10wrote a review Dec 2023,"1st solo trip and I was so pleased I picked this hotel. When I 1st checked I I was given a room in K block which  was a good walk away and from  all the amenities, however I informed reception I was unhappy, immediately I was given another room overlooking the pool (520) I was delighted. I think it was Pauli and Rodrigo, and the manager that helped me. (Not good with names sorry)The resort is feet away from the beach and 1st night I sipped sangria watching the most amazing sunset. I was only self catering so couldnâ€™t comment on the food etc.  Rooms were clean and well equipped and for what I paid it was well worth the money. The entertainment team Boris and the girl were amazing, and really friendly, I even learnt how to make cocktails lol. I would come here again.. same room please Xx",Dec,2023,Dec 2023,2023-12-01,2023,5
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,RachelNotts,9,RachelNottswrote a review Oct 2016,I stayed at this hotel in June when it wasn't full and it was amazing - I then gave a 5/5 review.  The difference when I have just stayed is that the hotel was full and there wasn't enough staff working to give 5 star service.  Breakfast tables outside just sat after people had left and remained dirty until you asked one of the 2 staff working out there if they could clear one for you.  Not good sitting surrounded by dirty tables for a 5 star hotel.  Service at the pool bar was great - however when I visited in June staff would come round to your sunbeds to collect drinks orders - never saw this in September.  Trying to get a drink in the main bar was really hard when you go to the bar they tell you to take a seat but then it took ages for anyone to come and collect your order.  You now have to get your towels from reception which is ridiculous as it causes huge queues and you are queuing behind people checking out - they should return to getting your beach towels from the beach bar.  6 reception desks but only 2 ever manned and more staff never appeared to help when there were long queues which was 75% of the time.Such a shame as a lovely hotel but need more staff when hotel is full.  I return again next month - hopefully things will have improved again and be like they were in June.,Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,2

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,holidaychicLondon,340,holidaychicLondonwrote a review Sep 2018,"I stayed here with my two adult daughters from Friday to Monday. We arrived at the hotel just after 11am and were delighted that our room was ready. Check in was swift.Our room was on the 8th floor and had a partial sea view. The room was spacious enough to hold the extra bed as the 3 of us were sharing a room. Beds were comfy, good size balcony and plenty of space to store clothes etc.It was let down though by not having a mirror in the bedroom, not even a small one, whereas there were 3 in the bathroom...I was also very disappointed that upon Arrival the lovely porter explained that we could use any card in the electric switch and that it didn’t have to be a room key. It worked so that was great, but not so great that it went missing when we returned to the room the day before we were leaving.. thankfully it wasn’t a bank card but a loyalty card with points on. I rang down to reception to ask if they could check with house keeping if they’d taken it by mistake and they said they’d check and call me back, but didn’t..Also you are provided with a bottle of water each day per person and one day one of my daughters left her bottle of water beside the bed which had a third left in it and so house keeping only left us 2 that day.... pretty petty.Breakfast was very good, plenty of choice and a lovely light and spacious dining room. A great extra touch was the table set up outside the restaurant with tea, coffee and a few cakes etc to take away, great added bonus!The pool is big with plenty of sun beds so even on arrival day we didn’t get to the pool until mid day and we still found  three beds. We had a delicious pizza there and cocktails served by a charming young waitress. It’s a really nice clean pool area, thumbs up!We were unable to keep our room past mid day on check out day but could use the spa showers which you have to book and pay for - 5 euros per person. You are provided with a towel and there’s all in one shampoo/body wash pumps but nothing else as you normally get in spas like cotton pads, cotton buds, shower caps etc.. bring your own stuff in with you..It’s a minute walk to the beach and the beach is gorgeous! Sun beds were 20 euros for two with an umbrella or 28.50 for three with the brolly. Walking to the marina takes 10 minutes max and is full of restaurants and bars..There’s a spa shop 5 min walk - buy your water etc there!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay despite my little grumbles and would return.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,2

On top of that I ordered a bottle of wine, which arrived open with another cork was corked with bits floating in it. A second bottle they broke the cork too, a third was finally drunk but was the poorest tasting wine. they need to review their list, as Portugal make some great wines, So do go, enjoy your stay, and EAT OUT, p.s. the wifi was painfully slow",Dec,2012,Dec 2012,2012-12-01,2012,2

Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,lyeong,24,lyeongwrote a review Sep 2017,"Stayed there for 5 nights City break and enjoyed it totally.Friendly reception manager, attention to detail chamber maid as well as breakfast staff made our stay very pleasant. You can even get champagne for breakfast in this hotel!!! It's part of the breakfast at no extra. Breakfast choices covers traditional English breakfast, local delicious pastry, healthy mix fruit yoghurt, fruits, varieties of meats, cheese board, cereals and so much more. The only thing to need to remind them when you order coffee or tea is to get them bring some milk as I think local like it as it is. :DRoom is very spacious and bed is very comfortable. The hotel offers you choices of pillows you can sleep with or the default that's already there. I like that idea. There's nothing to fault about the room and the view.Restaurant is on level 18 with an outside area you can sit out. Even better view when you are out there. Complimentary Port wine was delicious!!!The hotel is a walkable 20 mins from the nearest metro station Casa De Musica. Taking a taxi is not too expensive and there Uber service in Porto that can help you too.Perfect time to visit Porto this time of year and it has the sunshine, beautiful autumn colours begin, still warm enough and it's harvest time which is great to visit vineyards at Duoro Valley.Hope you will enjoy this place and hotel as much as we did.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

The locals are rightly proud of where they  live and it shows in their happy demeanour.And now our hotel ... First Class in every way.  Amazingly friendly and helpful staff, reception, housekeeping,  bars and restaurant and all who played their part, such a credit to the owners and management of the Cliff Bay.We relaxed, had wonderful meals here, all of which were delicious and presented like a work of art.So thankyou to Madeira,  thankyou to the Cliff Bay.

Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,ajcH1348DB,12,ajcH1348DBwrote a review Jul 2016,"We stayed at the Bellevue Apartments at the end of June and what a wonderful time we had. Based on the ground floor in apartment 12, we had an extremely spacious room complete with two single beds made into a double, a kitchen, living room area with sofas and TV, bathroom with shower and bath, and a small front terrace. Our room was cleaned twice in a week, with bins emptied and towels refreshed.As many others have said, Dieter and Sigi are very pleasant and approachable, as were the maids.  We were given a warm welcome on arrival and this was only improved by the other guests staying at Bellevue who gave the place a real sense of community (especially since it is only a small set of apartments).The pool area was lovely and cleaned daily. Sunbeds complete with parasols (which in the heat of June offered a welcome respite from the sun!).Local area very nice with plenty of bars and restaurants just a short walk away. Mini supermarket only across the road from Bellevue which came in handy for stocking up on lunch and a daily afternoon icecream. Beach a 15 minute walk from the apartments. Make sure you go on the boardwalk around sunset for beautiful views!Only two (very minor) complaints about the room - the beds were a bit too hard for my liking and there wasn't a dressing table area, so I ended up putting a chair in front of a full length mirror behind the front door to do hair and makeup. There is a good mirror in the bathroom however if you don't mind doing these things standing up.Another thing to mention, if you are a light sleeper then you may be bothered by the noise of the seagulls (since Carvoeiro is a fishing village). I took a good set of ear plugs which helped enormously.All in all a fantastic holiday and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Bellevue to others!Thank you Dieter and Sigi =).",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4
