Saccharum,Westpfels,15,Westpfelswrote a review Aug 2016,"Stayed here for a week with my son, daughter and her boyfriend, all in their twenties. We booked through Thomson on half board basis. The private transfer from the airport was very good, got to see a lot of the lovely Island on the way to the hotel. The hotel itself is very modern and has been decorated to a high standard, if not a little dark as some other reviews have mentioned. Our rooms were lovely and very clean, my daughter had a room right across from the private beach, my room was quite away from the main hotel areas but still had a nice view looking out on a grass area but still with a sea view. The infinity pool was amazing, always plenty of sun beds. The bar around the pool served lovely food, we ate there most days. The buffet  had plenty of choice and overall was good, the only let down was that most of the evenings we had to wait for a table to be cleared and the staff took their time in taking our drinks order. I think they need more staff to clear and lay the tables. The evening entertainment was okay , unfortunately the bar closed around 12 every evening, would have been nice to have gone on a bit longer, as there isn't any where close to the hotel to go too. So wouldn't recommend this hotel if you want lots of bars or clubs,  would suit honeymooners or people looking for a relaxing holiday.  We went into the capital Funchal which was really lovely we spent the whole day there, plenty to do. We also went on a boat trip to see the dolphins which we all really enjoyed and did get to see them which was fantastic. We did have a really good weeks holiday here and would recommend the hotel and Madeira, we would definitely return.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Villas Barrocal,George M,87,George Mwrote a review Apr 2014,"We spent 4 weeks at the Villas Barrocal in the Village of Péra, Algarve, (mid-March to mid-April 2014). and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in our 2 storey, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom villa.  Péra is well-situated centrally for day trips to tour the Algarve region. We could see the ocean from our balcony and the Atlantic and some beautiful beaches and boardwalks are only about a mile to the south. Our unit overlooked the pool but it was a bit too cool at the time of our visit for many pool activities. Units have several areas in which to enjoy the sun privately. You can be as social or as unsocial as you wish. We used our well-equipped, full-sized kitchen extensively and saved a lot of $$ on meals. There is a large shopping mall about 4 miles to the East (just East of the Village of Guia on N125) which contains a huge grocery store called Continente, a large food court and cinemas. Around 9 am. each morning, we found fresh rolls and a 1.5 L. bottle of water on our doorstep – a nice touch. Units are kept spotlessly clean by staff; beds are comfortable; plenty of hot water with good pressure; there’s a snack bar on-site with strong wi-fi, and office staff are friendly and helpful. The Villas Barrocal does have a few minor flaws however. The signal for the free wi-fi is pretty weak in the villas and can be very frustrating. We went to the office in the evenings where the signal is strong and caught up on our e-mail. The furniture in our unit was passable but is beginning to show normal signs of wear. Management will soon need to consider some updating. There are in-room safes but there is a fee to use them. TV channels are very limited. The hours during which one can use the laundry are very restrictive. In spite of these and a few other minor irritants, we would certainly recommend the Villas Barrocal and would be pleased to stay there again.  If you incur a road toll as the result of driving on the A22, you can pay it after 48 hours at the mini-mart located only a couple of doors up the street from the hotel office. One word of caution for anyone not used to driving in Portugal – many of the streets in the Village of Péra are very narrow and meeting another car or truck can be challenging.  Because a car is essential here, our advice is to proceed with a great deal of care. And don’t be intimidated by aggressive drivers who ride your rear bumper – it seems to be a cultural thing.",Apr,2014,Apr 2014,2014-04-01,2014,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Lorraine C,0,Lorraine Cwrote a review Jul 2025,"Second time to spend 9 days at this hotel. It’s excellent. It is five stars in my opinion. If you value security, cleanliness, service and amenities then this is the place for you.The staff work tirelessly. Place was spotless. Great for families of all ages but especially for young kids up to early teens.Big shout out to Bidhya behind the bar for all she did for us and Mario in reception. Same thing.  I didn’t get the bus drivers name but he was standing out for his service to all the tourists on every single bus run we witnessed.Every staff member we encountered was excellent but they were stand out for us.Don’t hesitate and book.The only thing is… the pool can be very cold!

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Maura8508,35,Maura8508wrote a review Oct 2023,"We booked a three bedroom, two bath unit with a gorgeous roof deck that had a perfect view of the sunset. The resort was a 5 euro Uber drive into town, less than 10 minutes walk to the beach and had wonderful pools and a spa. We were disappointed that the resort did not offer yoga during our stay but look forward to going back again. The food and service was great, the accommodations clean and updated. This was a great find, HIGHLY recommend.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,5

Saccharum,AWD44,30,AWD44wrote a review Feb 2017,"Exceptionally clean and wonderful facilities, very friendly staff and great large rooms and beds, very comfy.  Breakfast is a very large buffet style affair with good quality and choice, evening meals are also buffet style or a la carte and there is not much difference in price between the two unless of course you have an enormous appetite and visit the buffet several times ! The only downside is the fact that it is so far away from any little town or Funchal although there is a shuttle bus it only goes once a day and comes back at 6pm so a long day, so car hire would be essential if you want to get out and about.We also tried to book treatments ever day but they were fully booked all the time very disappointing so book before you stay ! Overall a truly lovely hotel and good for peace and relaxation",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,4

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,laradc,102,laradcwrote a review Mar 2022,"The hotel is on the main shopping street in Lisbon.  Lisbon is a relatively small city and this hotel was central to everything, you are able to walk everywhere.We arrived and were welcomed at reception, check in was quick and seamless.  The hotel is laid out in such a way that even if it is busy you rarely see other people unless at breakfast which is nice as it never felt crowded.   We had booked a junior suite and were in room 302.  Great size room, doors that opened over the main street which could have been noisy at night but they were so well glazed we couldn't hear any noise at all.  Room was large with lovely high ceilings, it had a decent sized dressing room and a large bathroom with both a tub and walk in shower.  Bed  was really comfortable.  The only small suggestion for improvement I could think to make would be to put a plug socket near a mirror so people can dry and style their hair.  There were no sockets in the bathroom and the hairdryer lead wasn't long enough to stretch to the mirror in the dressing room.   Minor point though.  Usual things such as bathrobes, slippers, umbrellas were in the room.  Turn down and cleaning service were excellent.  Freely gave out more water, towels etc if requested and the room was cleaned to a very high standard.The hotel is boutique in style and had a number of areas indoors where you could sit and work or read or just be somewhere other than your room.  These were all cosy and nicely decorated.  The large outside terrace is lovey for breakfast or drinks in the evening weather permitting.  They did have good outdoor heaters and blankets available.   There is also a small heated pool for warmer months or the brave.  Drinks in the bar and the service were lovely.We thought there was excellent choice at breakfast, cold buffet, cereal, meat and cheese and pastries and a good hot menu to choose from and you can order as much as you need.  The breakfast service manager was a stand out member of staff, she couldn't do enough to help and on the one occasion there was confusion with orders she personally resolved it and couldn't apologise enough.We ate in the restaurant one night.  The design is lovely quite Japanese in style and it was relatively busy which gave it a nice atmosphere.  I think personally the food in the evening restaurant has room for improvement.  Some dishes were good, others just OK.  I understand food is personal preference but some dishes lacked flavour.  That said it would be no means stop me returning to stay at the hotel and I would definitely return to stay.",Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,4
Palacio Vila Flor,Dinah B,122,Dinah Bwrote a review May 2019,"Main thing to mention is that this is not really a 'hotel'. It is more like a B&B or guesthouse. As such it has limited hours for checking in and out, but this is made clear when you book. I really enjoyed my stay; I had a room overlooking the river and enjoyed seeing the cruise ships come and go, and other boats, but there was a bit of street noise - take your earplugs if you have a river view room. Contrary to what others have said, I thought the breakfast was fine: fresh rolls, butter, jam, cheese and cold meat, fruit and cereals, fresh juice, unlimited coffee or tea. But no cooked breakfast. In good weather you can take breakfast on the roof terrace which is very pleasant. The biggest downside was having to share a bathroom, but I really do think that is reflected in the price.",May,2019,May 2019,2019-05-01,2019,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Travelledscotch,5,Travelledscotchwrote a review Jul 2017,"The surroundings, the hotel's bar and restaurant (I use bar as I've still to see the pool bar actually open) are all nice. The staff are welcoming. However the rooms are awful. Ours still had sticky floors and horribly dirty work surfaces. Going fall inclusive and paying over the odds we expected at least a clean room with either a double bed or two twins zipped into a king. Nope! Of course not. We got a dirty room, two very twin beds and no hair dyer in the bathroom. On asking for one I was told to 'wait until tomorrow'. Not the response that a five star should be giving.The food is fine and alcohol is good. But be warned - no cocktails are included in the all inclusive package.I also contacted the hotel before we arrived and got no response. All in all this hotel has been a let down. Not good enough.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

It was the best Hotel we stayed in alongside The Caro Hotel in Valencia.We couldn't fault it. We had a great suite, Room 402 which had three separate rooms. The restaurant is superb and the outside terrace so nice. We were so well looked after by Marta on front desk, Miguel and Christelle at the bar/restaurant who provided top quality service. It is so well located and much preferable to a large hotel where you are just another number. Here is so different. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,2

Thanks to all the team, especially for the unexpected gift of sparkling wine and birthday cake that we found in our room to mark my special occasion.

Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,briesmie,19,briesmiewrote a review Sep 2012,"A great chill surf hostel located just outside the main city in the more residential area. A little difficult to find my first time, but once I finally figured out  the hostels location,  I realized how amazing it was. Located in a large house, this hostel houses a massive pool in the backyard, a large kitchen/commons room, large size bedrooms, clean bathrooms and fantastic staff.  I quite liked the diversity of the travellers staying at the hostel, a really good mix that allowed for an atmosphere where you could party hard if you wanted to, or completely relax and do nothing and not  be bothered. I give the hostel credit for putting on a number of fantastic events to help travellers interact and see the city. Would definitely stay in this hostel again in Lagos.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,5

Room is comfortable and cosy, with hight technology glassing windows that allow for a perfect night sleep. Bathroom is shiny and new, with extra heavy toals. Bed linnen is amongst the best I have tried.Breakfast is served at the restaurant with good variety and quality items. Pitty the weather didn't allow for a garden table, maybe next time.An interior pool big enough for swimming was another item To try on a next trip once this time I did not came prepared.

Luna Clube Oceano,Joanne E,1,Joanne Ewrote a review Jul 2016,"excellent location situated between the old town and the strip, we walked back forth every night as was a nice walk even though there was a hill on the way back from the old town. Great location for the beach too although again there was a hill but cant really be avoided here.Friendly staff in hotel and great rooms. Have stayed here for the last 3 years now so know what to expect and always happy with what is on offer. Didn't eat breakfast here as was quite expensive when there was a very reasonable friendly café down the road offering the same. did lunch a couple of times which was quite tasty. We were in a one bed apartment which overlooked the pool and was spacious and well equipped. Air con, sky news etc, cleaners were on the ball.Pool was great and although big signs ups saying no reserving of sunbeds it happened most days. childrens pool was good and was a good mix of holidaymakers there including families, couples, groups even stag parties which did  not cause any problems.Highly rate this hotel and location",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5
Vila Galé Albacora,Barrybloke,155,Barryblokewrote a review Mar 2018,"On the edge of an estuary about 2 miles to the southeast of Tavira, this hotel can be difficult to find. Look for Forte de Rato on map and roadsigns. There are some good walks from the hotel.We paid a little extra for a room with a river view – well worth it with the patio. The room was certainly comfortable and with very good wifi; the only quibbles were no tea-making facilities and having to pay a supplement for the safe.The remote location encourages use of the restaurant; the hotel gives a free bottle of wine for a couple dining on the first evening. Prices are reasonable with good service and a complementary appetiser (first night smoked salmon, second night tuna fishcake) but we felt that the food, whilst ok, should have been better for a 4-star hotel.The breakfast was very good – especially the scrambled egg and coffee. If you can get a window table, enjoy the views of hoopoes and hares.We enjoyed our stay, but we were there at a quiet time of year. The hotel has 162 bedrooms; breakfast could be very busy when the hotel is full. Just the evening food and lack of bedroom tea-making facilities prevent a top rating.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,4

Dream Chiado,grayfam,317,grayfamwrote a review Apr 2019,"Just returned from a weeks stay at Dream Chicado. The apartment itself was very good, comfortable beds, good shower, everything clean and working. Nice touches like the cell phone to take out and about - once I mastered the menus it was very helpful to plan activities and book restaurants ( essential, Lisbon very busy).We had excellent communication , particularly with Ricardo.The location is good - knowing Lisbon is hilly and having limited mobility I wanted to be somewhere with a lift and situated in a relatively flat area with good access to the Metro/ transport ( top hint if you go in the entrance to the Metro round the corner and get the escalators up to the other entrance you are very near the nightlife of Barrio Alta- wish I had worked that out earlier in our stay).The apartments are a bit more central than I realised which in many ways is a good thing, even I could walk to many places and taxis are cheap eg to Castle. It does mean there is a little more street noise that I expected but the double glazing keeps most of that at bay. Very little internal noise, only very inconsiderate people in the corridor occasionally heard.However, we were disturbed by builders working next door and across the road. During weekdays they started at 8 am and some evenings ran on past 7 pm. The noise and vibration could be very significant indeed - we sometimes wondered if a drill would appear through the adjoining wall !  Rodrigo offered to move us after the weekend but the arrangements were a bit complicated and we were not sure it would result in significant improvement so we declined. I took to sleeping in earplugs and highly recommend  taking some.The other slight drawback is that being so central the local shops are all fashion boutiques and such like, nice for a browse but not good if you want milk and bread...... there are a few mini markets a shortish walk away. We were delighted to find a Lidl round the corner from the Azulejo Museum - right beside a bus stop back to the Apartment, so it is worth going there early in your stay if provisions are an issue - or look at the map around any other slightly further out destinations !",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,3

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,cheekychappy25,41,cheekychappy25wrote a review May 2016,"My husband booked us a short break as a surprise, staying at the Crowne Plaza....it was perfect!! The hotel is so relaxed with wonderful friendly staff. Our deluxe King room was spacious and very clean with everything we needed. We had read a few reviews that have negatively commented about there being only one chair for the balcony however each room also has a chair inside that can easily be moved outside, so we really didn't see why this could be an issue. Also the lack of coffee capsules?! Again, we didn't see this as an issue, we could've easily bought our own if we'd wanted to, so no need for negative feedback.We have nothing negative to say, the whole hotel was immaculately kept, with lots of staff around to help if needed but who were also very good at not crowding us. The breakfast was lovely with more than enough choice, and even when busy the staff made sure we always had fresh tea/coffee, our table was cleared quickly, and we never waited more than a minute to be seated. (This may be different at busier times of the year but was definitely not an issue in May).We used the spa facilities which again were lovely. We didn't have any treatments but if we return than we definitely will book something.The outside pool and area were well maintained and clean, although the pool was very cold.Vilamoura itself was quiet and relaxing too. We walked from the hotel to the marina using a few different routes, all of which took no longer than 5-10minutes (strolling not fast walking). It is all fairly flat so great for anyone who has mobility issues. The marina has lots of bars and restaurants with plenty of outside seating.Hopefully we will be returning soon!!",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4
Vilas Marrocha,archers2016,5,archers2016wrote a review Jun 2018,"We stayed here for almost 2 weeks in June, and had a great holiday. We arrived well ahead of the check in time on a national holiday, and were able to check in as soon as we arrived. The staff at reception were very friendly.The resort is well maintained, and the pool area is great for a sunny day, with plenty of loungers and umbrellas. The pools are a good size - the uppermost pool only opened half way through our stay, but that may have been due to the poorer weather at the beginning of our holiday. Even without the third pool, it never felt too busy around this area. The indoor pool was warm, which was ideal given the cooler weather at the beginning of June this year.The pool bar and restaurant is well priced, although it can be very busy at times for the number of servers. The food is delicious, although the level of service does depend on how busy they are. The on-site mini market was expensive but conveniently located if you needed something quickly.We booked a superior 1 bedroom apartment, which had 2 balconies - great if you want to follow the sun during the day. The apartment was tired and could do with an update. However, it did have everything we needed for a good holiday. The free Wi-Fi was very useful, and worked in most of the apartment. The apartment was cleaned 3 times a week during our stay. The only problem here was that none of our cleaners spoke English, meaning it was difficult to ask for a couple of minutes extra when they arrived earlier in the day. Not a major problem as such (especially as we don't speak much Portuguese), but could have been embarrassing depending on when exactly they arrived.The complimentary minibus into town runs 4 times a day and is a good way to see Armacao de Pera. It drops you off in a central location, and the driver was happy to do another run when there were more passengers than seats.There were a couple of very minor issues with the apartment and our stay, which is why we haven't given a higher rating. However you can't expect 5 star facilities for 3 star prices. We would definitely come back for another holiday.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,4
Natura Algarve Club,MissGreen_13,4,MissGreen_13wrote a review Apr 2015,"This was/is a good place to stay.We arrived about 12am, was worried we were too late to check in, however their was a nice lady at reception that went through the details efficiently and showed us to our room.  need to leave 100Euro deposit which received back at the end of our stay.We stayed in room 109, no real faults to complain about it was suitable for the purpose.  Was happy to see a washing machine although we didn't use.  There was a kettle, toaster, basic cooking facilities, cooked spag bol, modern cooker, 4 hot plates, fridge with mini freezer, this hummed quite a bit so ensured kitchen door closed when sleeping (minor fault, not even really worth mentioning).  Bathroom: Bidet, Toilet, bath and shower.  Didn't use the shower as it felt quite temperamental to get off,  Plenty of hot water.  Nice space on the balcony with a table and 2 chairs.  Air-con or can put on a heat system.  Clean and tidy, ladies came in, I would say mainly every day, friendly and polite.  Stayed in the apartment for 1 whole day due to weather, thankfully we brought the tablet and hard drive so had lots of downloads to watch.  About 3-4 English channels, however we did watch a Portuguese version of Britain's got talent, this was good,  CBS reality, one day Heart radio station came through but as stated had brought our own tv, had food to eat, so staying in was ok.  Intermarche - Supermarket down the road so you can stock up the fridge.Stayed 4th-11th April, weather was great (in my opinion), im 50 shades of red!!! however I must admit I failed to use sun cream as the weather reports stated 18 - 19 degrees with scattered showers, well... first day cloudy, still caught the sun! 2nd day, warm with the odd clouds, 3rd day/evening, amazing thunderstorm! watched that for a while, this must have cleared the air because after that it was nice weather.  Last day was hottest.  About 5-10 min walk to strip, 5-10 min to beach.  The beach is sandy with lovely coves and rock formation's.Complex has a x2 pools, a small one which is perfect for your smaller child and a bigger one for older children/adults, although my son could stand in a few parts with his feet touching the bottom.  Too cold for me but a few did brave it, my 7 year old included.  so is do-able if you don't mind the initial shock.  (if only it was slightly heated I would have definitely got in as it looked clean and inviting).All staff were helpful, one of the ladies in reception kindly called us a cab (50c), we only visited Algarve shopping centre, around 12-15euro cab one way.  Also they organised an egg hunt for the children, which was nice of them, i thought, however the children found all the eggs so fast, it was over quick, but the main thing is all children found something and they had fun! Went to a Market on the Tuesday,  lots of bags, shoes, jewellery, clothing, fruits, veg... etc to buy.  Bought a few goodies.Overall glad we stayed here and within this area, as some places we passed and walked by were really outta the way! Natura is in a perfect location.  No sea view but nice pool view.  Would definitely stay here again, especially to it being out of season, it was nice, I can imagine that in season it would be too much!  in fact ill be looking into this for next year shortly even though I don't really like to visit the same place twice, I would definitely return to Natura.Thanks Natura team.",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,LMTs-World,21,LMTs-Worldwrote a review Oct 2014,"We have stayed at a few crown Plazas worldwide and this was one of the better ones in terms of size and amenities. We heard it used to be the Atlantis which may be why. The hotel was clean. Rooms clean and tidy etc. Great Pool. 10-15min walk to the marina but 2 mins walk to the beach which was fantastic. Only downside was you had to hire sun lounges for 16euros a day or 11.50 euros for a morning or afternoon on the beach. Which really adds up when your going daily! We stayed half board and the cuisine was good and staff very friendly. The hotel was very full and they did struggle a bit to keep the food coming out (as it's buffet style) once they ran out of something you may have to wait for a waiter to see it had gone before it would get replaced. Some gorgeous restaurants on the marina though. The Thai especially was very good. We often spent lunch time in NEWS a loveley bar marina side, fairly dear though. 9 euro cocktail and 6 for beer. Mains 25 euro etc. we hit 100 euros a few lunches running and there was only 2 of us plus our 1 year old.

Quinta do Furão,pdmancs,465,pdmancswrote a review Nov 2020,"Had an enjoyable three night stay at the Quinta Do Furao.It’s a beautiful property about 3km from Santana, and a great base for hiking and coastal walks. The grounds too are pretty substantial for a nice sunrise or sunset walk. I booked half an hour in the sauna each evening which was the perfect way to relax after a long day hiking.They’ve just completed renovation works, and my room felt really clean and fresh, as did the lounge, bar and breakfast area.Breakfast was superb - lots of choice and, with guests given their own tongs, and masks mandatory, a mostly normal buffet was possible!WiFi was good.Not so good:- the gym is pretty much just a couple of cardio machines. The rest of it is hopeless. No more than a few fiddly small weights and a couple of dumbbell bars. I always try and look for the positive, but I struggled!- To be honest, the restaurant and pub, housed in a separate building, felt a little gloomy compared to the main house, but the food (and service) was excellent.- The pub closes very early, around 7pm I think, so no chance of a nightcap after dinner. The bar in the main building is open (kind of) but it’s very bright and much more of a lobby/daytime space.",Nov,2020,Nov 2020,2020-11-01,2020,3

Made the booking through Alpharooms last week and same was confirmed. Note there was ample availability on most websites at time of booking. However, yesterday, with 2 days to go to our trip, we were contacted by Alpharooms to say that the booking was cancelled and there was no availability at the hotel. I was shocked as everything had been confirmed and I checked Crowne Plaza Hotels website and even yesterday, there was still availability. So I contacted the hotel and spoke with Laura [--], the reservations manager and I was completely dumfounded as to how she spoke with me. She said there is no room at the hotel, I asked how this could be when there was at the time of booking and even still today. She was so rude and said there is no availability for you at the price you paid. I was shocked as this was only €100 less than what they were offering direct and what Alpharooms charged, if Alpharooms gave a better deal, we suffer!! I asked her could she not provide us with an alternative room as it is me and Mum going away and its in 2 days, flights, transfers etc, everything booked. She was aggressive in her tone and said I will not give you the details of our and Alpharooms contract. We have no availability. I advised her that I found this situation upsetting and stressful as we now had nowhere to stay and that she was rude to me. Her response was 'yeah, yeah I'm rude' whatever!!! I was so shocked that this could happen to us and cannot understand why. I called back and asked to speak with a manage, I spoke with Alexandra on reception who asked me what is was about. I told her and she said, our manager doesn't speak with guests!! We have been so stressed, worried and upset over the past 24 hours, over how we have been treated by Crowne Plaza Hotel and Alpharooms. We now have flights and transfers, car parking etc booked to come on Thursday and we have nowhere to stay. DO NOT BOOK WITH ALPHAROOMS OR CROWNE PLAZA VILAMOURA!!!! Disgusting manner in which they treat their guests. Thanks for ruining our Mum and daughter 3 nights away. My sister contacted the hotel today out of interest and was given a price to stay the same nights so the hotel is not booked out. I do not understand what game these 2 companies are playing.

Eurostars Porto Douro,Jannelaf,21,Jannelafwrote a review Apr 2016,"I took a chance booking this hotel as it had no reviews, but I discovered on check in that was because they had just opened a week ago!  This translates to everything is fresh and new. The photos do not do this place justice.The location is perfect, right on the river, walkable to everything, but not in the midst of it, which can be noisy and crowded. A glass of port was offered on check in, and the staff was welcoming and helpful. Diogo was amazing, going beyond the expected to help me find just the right solutions for my many requests.The rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds, and big fluffy robes, inviting you to relax and enjoy the view. There are large French doors to let in fresh air, but when closed they block any street noise. There were nice touches everywhere, like a small bottle of port and a snack to welcome you to your room.Breakfast was abundant and fresh, one of the best I've had.I'll definitely return and recommend to others.",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,5

Ocean Gardens,Virginia P,1,Virginia Pwrote a review Aug 2013,"We had never visited Madeira before this trip but we were told that we would have a lovely time - we certainly did! This was due in no small part to the staff and facilities at Ocean Gardens Hotel in Funchal. Perched on the edge of Funchal just 15 minutes from the airport this hotel was just perfect. Everywhere was totally spotless and the staff could not have been friendlier - the restaurant staff were so lovely and we had a lot of fun with them (special thanks to Carlos and Joan for their superb customer service). Admittedly the hotel did not have entertainment in the evenings (although Portuguese TV is interesting!!) but we were there to relax and the surroundings certainly gave us that. Lovely pool and gardens, beautifully appointed rooms and a real laid back atmosphere. We were half board and certainly didn't think it was too 'samey' - with a choice of starters, meat or fish main and choice of desserts we weren't fishing around for something we fancied  Admittedly if you did 2 weeks you might find it boring but it was always well cooked and well presented. The courtesy bus was so handy down to the centre and the local bus stopping right outside the hotel was a bonus. Best tips for trips - use the yellow buses for a cost effective tour if the main sites of Funchal and if you want to do Monte go up by local bus as part of the tourist deal which includes a cable car ride from the botanical gardens - and avoid the taxi drivers and the exorbitant toboggan ride!! The typical Madeiran evening was also well worth it.  Fabulous hotel in a fabulous country - thank you Ocean Gardens!",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,5

Pestana Viking,Andy649Herts,124,Andy649Hertswrote a review Jul 2016,"My first point is one of caution, everything else thereafter is good. I booked a week's holiday at this hotel in early July 2016. My booking was for a garden view room. We had an early flight and managed to get into our room shortly after 2pm. The room we were given was room 505. This room was directly above the hotel entrance, overlooking the road which is directly outside. I asked to upgrade but was told the hotel was full. The following day I returned to reception to query my booking. I was told that the hotel owners deem that the rooms overlooking the road at the front to be garden rooms aswell as those at the side which do actually overlook the gardens! Initially I was not offered a change of room but after a few minutes was told that I could change rooms the next afternoon. We were subsequently given room 305. This did look out over the side gardens. In a nutshell, be aware that rooms 501 to 506 and the same rooms on the next 2 or 3 floors are the same - overlooking the road.That said, the rest of the holiday was fabulous. The location of the hotel is perched above a couple of sandy beaches both within a few minutes walking distance.Despite being a medium sized hotel, it never seemed to be 'busy' or noisy. Décor was pretty good and rooms were a decent size. Each of the rooms we had, had a small kitchenette area with a fridge, microwave, basin and crockery/cutlery, all hidden behind sliding doors adjacent to the wardrobe.We were told before we left that the hotel is undergoing some refurbishment later this year. It's actually in pretty good shape as it is and well worth a stay here before the refurb.Being perched on cliffs, the views from the gardens and pool area, out over the sea, were stunning. Outside pool area was clean with ample beds. It was never over crowded. There is also an indoor pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and Wellness Centre along with a reasonable sized gym (didn't use it though!).Breakfast was available both inside and by the pool. Cooked breakfast, continental breakfast, fruit, cereal etc - all good.Hotel is located about 35 mins walk/5 mins taxi (6 euros) from the main Amercao de Pera town where there are numerous bars and restaurants. There are about a dozen restaurants within 10 to 15 mins walk away.Free air conditioning and Wi-Fi within the rooms.All in all, apart from the initial room allocation, this is a really good hotel, with good staff and good standard rooms.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,3

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,kala327,112,kala327wrote a review Jul 2012,"I booked this hotel based on the reviews and the fact that due to my visit being only 24-hours, I wanted to be close to the monuments in Lisbon (i.e., Belem) instead of being in the city center.Based on the reviews I was really looking forward to my stay there, however brief.  Surprisingly, I was a bit disappointed.I contacted the hotel directly to make a reservation as I wanted to request/ensure early check-in.  My transcontinental flight meant I'd be arriving around 7 a.m. and I didn't want to have to wander around the city for hours waiting for a room to be ready.  They accommodated my request -- albeit upon paying a surcharge -- which was a little steep but was money well spent.  I would have appreciated if they would have waived the charge if the room would have been available anyway but I have no way to know if they really held the room for me or it was otherwise unoccupied.My biggest complaint was the lack of a shower.  I knew the hotel was modern and I enjoy that style, but the room had no shower!  I've never seen this anywhere.  There was a freestanding tub without any kind of curtain or door and the only way to take a shower was to use a handheld nozzle that didn't have any bar or pole to hang it on.  This was extremely awkward.  Water got everywhere due to the lack of any curtain or door on the tub and even worse there was no place to hang/mount the handheld nozzle, I had to constantly put it in the floor of the tub when I needed to shampoo and then reach down and grab it when I wanted to use the water.  I was very disappointed with the bathroom and cannot recommend this hotel as a result.The price of the hotel is very high compared to other options in Lisbon and arriving first thing in the morning the area looks a little drab, but for a one-day stay it was more than fine and convenient.  However, should my travels ever take me back to Lisbon again I would either go elsewhere or ensure I have a room with a shower.  If you want to be in the city center, this is not the place to stay.  While not far from the city center, it's not in walking distance and you definitely feel as if you are in the suburbs a bit.  Having said that, I did not want to be in the city center and I reserved this hotel being well aware of its location close to the monuments and being outside of the center of Lisbon.Note: regarding taxis to the hotel from the airport, I did my best to avoid getting scammed from the airport.  I speak a little Portuguese and even asked the hotel in advance what I can expect to pay from the airport.  The hotel staff told me 20-25 euros depending on the route.  On the way from the airport, it cost 27 euros (including the surcharge for 2 suitcases) -- note there was no traffic.  On the way back to the airport, it was 15 euros!  Both routes were metered.  So definitely I got ripped off on the way to the hotel, but the way back it was even cheaper than the hotel estimated.  Not sure what to think here, but just passing along my experience.  Some travelers noted to go upstairs to departures in order to catch a cab from the airport (instead of baggage claim), but due to construction at the airport, I didn't see any other taxi stand so I had no choice in where to catch a taxi.In sum, hotel was nice but very expensive.  Staff is competent.  To me this hotel was only worth the expense as I did not have a lot of time in Lisbon and I wanted to be close to the monuments.  It's not convenient to the city center so depending on the nature of your trip, plan accordingly.  The lack of a shower in the room is what caused me to downtick the rating a bit.",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,3

Pousada Viseu,Elizabeth B,2,Elizabeth Bwrote a review Jun 2018,"My history of writing reviews is brief, but I do acknowledge how reliant I am on other traveler’s feedback when planning a trip. In writing this review please keep in mind that being from the US may skew my perspective of how a 4 us star hotel should present. First of all I want to point out the positives as there were many. From the moment we stepped into the reception area we were met with kind, approachable and efficient personnel. Our concierge was in training but made every effort to welcome us and show us in a warm and inviting way what the converted hospital/hotel had to offer. The bedroom and living area was spacious and the bathroom more than sufficient and well lit. Not loving that there were no outlets in bathrooms but that seems to be the standard in most European hotels. Here’s where it fell flat. The king size bed was hard as a rock. Seriously, it was like sleeping atop a box spring. Because it’s a converted hospital I thought at first this may be part of the theme since infirmary beds are not known for thier comfort! Lol! I feel this could easily be remedied with an extra thick pillow top mattress cover per patron request. We added a comforter/ quilt but in the end I slept on the couch provided in the living room area. Secondly, the room was so poorly lit I could hardly see to get dressed in the morning. Won’t go into the AC which shuts off when you leave the room! Although I understand the green reasoning behind this, it is sweltering when you return from being out for just a few hours. Breakfast was okay but needs improvement, especially the coffee which is offered via machine.  Overall, very friendly and picturesque hotel but there is no way I could give it more than 3 stars on a good day.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,3
