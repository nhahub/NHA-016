Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Nimz O,1,Nimz Owrote a review May 2024,"Rubbish. Need to loose the 5 star rating. Doesn't even have enough umbrellas to accommodate their guests at 32 degrees. Major Health and safety concern both jet2 and hotel guest relations are happy to ignore this issue and clearly are not here to hear thier customers concerns at all.When we raise this we simply got a shrug and apology. (Not good enough)Food is standard not much variety. Nothing like 5* in Turkey buffet.The Bouncy castle, popcorn and go karts are payable. The entertainment is in a large tent not a proper entertainment stage. And the pools are freezing as many visitors say.Only 1 standard snack place. With cold sandwiches and ice cream. Nothing else.This hotel is not a 5* please think twice before you book. I would say it's a low 4*.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,1
Hotel Madeira,Laurence H,16,Laurence Hwrote a review Jan 2016,"We stayed at this so called \"budget\" hotel from Jan4th 2016 for a week. On arrival we were a little irritated by the receptionist not even bothering to look up at us. When we spoke he didn't answer but luckily his colleague soon arrived who greeted us with a smile, registered us and showed us how to use the lift. This was the only time we received less than good service whilst we were there. Our room was clean and provided plenty of storage space, a very comfortable bed and a good bathroom. We paid €12 to use a room safe for the week. As this hotel is conveniently situated right in the centre of Funchal we chose a room at the quieter back and were not disturbed at all. Apparently the front of the hotel is noisier as it overlooks a park.  We chose a room with a balcony which because of the position of surrounding buildings had very little sun. The view included a castle but was mainly of rooftops and not particularly pretty! However I think this is to be expected when staying in the centre of a town. The breakfast was good and varied but would have benefited from a better selection of fresh fruit, teapots and milk jugs! Occasionally we found we had to queue for a hot drink so another hot drink machine would be a useful addition. The roof top bar and pool was very attractive and gave us amazing views across the town. The Christmas lights were absolutely spectacular. The bar served simple snacks and the barman was exceptionally friendly and smiley! We liked the position of this hotel as we could walk to all the attractions and varied restaurants in the town. We would certainly recommend this hotel for those who want a good budget hotel in the centre of the town.",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,ankan n,40,ankan nwrote a review Aug 2023,"Jupiter is probably the best hotel in Albufeira. We had a wonderful experience staying there. The staff were very welcoming, rooms were very big with a stunning view of the town and the sea. We had a variety of food everyday for breakfast, lunch and dinner and of course, choicest of drinks.It was a paradise for the kids. They had so much fun. There were three big pools, slides, ample entertainment during the day and at night. While leaving we felt that even 7 days were not enough. We'll surely visit again.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,5
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,CastleTaylor69,65,CastleTaylor69wrote a review Sep 2019,We stayed in August for eight nights. Ours was a group of two adults and two teenagers.We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a separate living room and large balcony.I understand why people say it is not quite 5 stars but the staff and the location more than make up for this.We stayed in the Anantara Vilamoura hotel last year and whilst this was probably more on a 5star scale we would prefer to return to Tivoli because of the location.It is a lovely hotel with a stunning backdrop of the cave and sea. The staff work very hard and were all friendly and helpful. The cleaning staff in particular work all day to keep the hotel well cleaned.Breakfast has a huge variety and it is very well staffed with lots of tables.We would be happy to return.,Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,RussM1981,6,RussM1981wrote a review Aug 2017,Positives were location which is a nice setting.The pools are not heated and cold.  Had to queue for breakfast because the restaurant fills up.  They have one of those machines at reception which is a bit of a scam asking you to choose Euros or Pounds (but very confusing) - if you choose Pounds you get ripped off.  Either I or the reception team did this by mistake but despite raising it 24 hours later it took a manager 10 days to respond and they were extremely unhelpful (they could have reversed the transaction and re-charged me) - basically the attitude was tough luck.  Beds were hard.,Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,2

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,lamontmc,24,lamontmcwrote a review Aug 2024,This facility was very well maintained with superb customer service. Within walking distance to downtown and lots to do there. Morning buffet was outstanding there is always something there for everyone. Drinks were a bit on the pricey side. My room was on the first floor facing the pool. I was super nervous it would be so loud there well into the evening but rest assure this is no THAT type of resort. It was perfectly peaceful and I had nothing to worry about day or night. But overall experience was superb.,Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Dan O,5,Dan Owrote a review Aug 2024,"Quite simply superb in every aspect. We had what I’d consider a town house with roof top terrace and it’s linked to the main spa by a corridor. I would personally class this as 5 star in terms of features and fittings, everything was immaculate and top end. The gym was way above what you’d usually get in holiday accommodation! The pools were fantastic and the guy who serves at the Juicy Corner cafe was superb - his cocktails are top notch. The location is incredible - the local beach a 2 min walk with 2 great beach restaurants. There is a 3km costal boardwalk from outside the Belmar that takes you into the main Lagos town and is one of the best walks you’ll have taking in the rugged cliff faces and coast. 10/10 and I’ll be booking up for next year. Top tip - pay extra for the rooftop terrace! Drinking a cold glass of wine watch the sunset from there is worth every penny",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,5

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Emma H,0,Emma Hwrote a review May 2025,"The past couple of days have been full of incredible experiences! Last night’s opera show was absolutely amazing. The performance was breathtaking, with stunning vocals and a captivating story that kept us all engaged from start to finish. Even my younger children were enchanted by the music and the beautiful stage production — it was a wonderful surprise to see them enjoying it so much.Then today, we had so much fun watching the salsa and bachata dancing. The energy was infectious and the dancers were fantastic! My children loved every minute of it — they were clapping along, moving to the beat, and totally mesmerized by the rhythm and colorful outfits. The salsa was full of flair and excitement, while the bachata brought a romantic and fun vibe that had everyone smiling. It was fab!These past two nights have given us so many lovely memories. From the elegance and emotion of the opera to the vibrant, joyful dance performances, we’ve truly had a taste of everything. It’s been such a joy to see my children enjoying and connecting with the arts in different forms — we’re all already talking about what shows we want to see next!",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,5
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Petalista,6,Petalistawrote a review Oct 2014,"The staff at this hotel are the best ambassadors that Portugal have ever had. They have a pride in delivering top service levels in all areas, from the staff at the San Lorenzo golf course, who truly did go more than the extra mile to ensure we had a perfect on course experience on every occasion we played. At the hotel (which is a few minutes from the beautiful beach) the cleanliness of the hotel was exemplary and the food was imaginative, perfectly presented and truly delicious. Everybody who works at the Dona Filipa is totally dedicated to making your holiday as happy and trouble free as possible, I just loved it. We had a newly refurbished room, decorations were very tastefully done and the bed was very comfortable. We were treated as though we were royalty, by everybody, and it is a refreshing change to be among such a dedicated team. Depression set in when we had to check out.....but we've re-booked!",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,5
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,David O,0,David Owrote a review Oct 2022,The hotel was luxurious and beautifully appointed. It had character and was unique. Service and care were excellent and we were made to feel welcome and special. A highlight was the way the staff accommodated my gluten free needs.

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,beadish,58,beadishwrote a review May 2016,"My husband daughter and I visited at the end of April . During our stay the weather was fantastic. However although tempted the pool was too cold to use.  Gym facilities were good , but you had to pay € 25/30 for a week or €5 a session.We found the hotel to be very comfortable. The apartment was exceptionally spacious, with a large lounge, kitchen, large bedroom , good bathroom and pleasant balcony. We had a room overlooking the car park (room 129) and although initially disappointed it was a godsend. Very quiet at night and hardly any movement during the day. All areas of the hotel were clean and the staff were helpful.The bar was cosy and busy at night. The entertainment consistent of karaoke, quizzes , bingo, singers etc and was ok.There was a happy hour and the cocktails were good ,with generous measures.During our stay there were a number of stag and hen do's. This wasn't a problem for us ,but they were quite noisy and the language was bad. (Not good if you have children) . However it was short lived and did not spoil our stay.Can' t comment on the food. The restaurant looked nice. I was told the breakfast was fine . €8.50 if you were self catering.Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definately return. We got an exceptionally good deal with Travel Republic.Would benefit from the pool bar opening earlier.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,3
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Martha S,0,Martha Swrote a review Sep 2016,"Public areas and lounge were I impressive.  The pool facilities were good with discreet areas we could sit. We were disappointed though with a number of things eg we had swallow nest on balcony with a box to collect droppings, no tea and coffee facilities in the room(apparently the category of our   room was not elite enough for this facility to be provided) .  However biggest disappointment was being told we would need to pay for a taxi to go to their golf course as their mini bus  was full.  This was despite free transfers being part of the golf holiday package!   Found attitude of some staff complacent.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,3
Hotel Madeira,Hapoise,106,Hapoisewrote a review Nov 2017,"I go a few times a year to Funchal and stayed in several hotels. This is, by far the best 3 star i have been.Recently renovated, the room was very spacious and comfortable. Flat screen TV with 50+ channels. Great bathroom with walk in shower. Breakfast above average than the usual 3 star hotel. One of the best locations in town, wright in the heart of Funchal. Very quiet location.A note to the management, the front desk staff are in need of some serious customer care training. The clerk was friendly but a bit awkward in some of the answers he gave to a friend of mine and also took ages to make our check in.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,5

Luna Clube Oceano,Jay D,0,Jay Dwrote a review Aug 2025,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Horrible, awful hotel. I genuinely don’t think it could have been any worse. I’ve never wrote a hotel review in my life but with the experience we had here, I feel like I have to. We were charged a €300 deposit when checking in, and there is no warning anywhere online of them taking a deposit. I read the hotels reply to a different review saying the room deposit when checking in is policy, which is a load of rubbish because we got talking to multiple other groups in the hotel and literally not one other group we spoke to had to pay a deposit. The rooms are below basic, outdated and dirty. There is no bar in the hotel, no snack bar or anything. The bar has apparently been shut since 2021 so you have to go the shop and buy your own drinks, ask the reception for a plastic cup and pour your down drinks by the pool. This hotel is literally below the bare minimum of what you’d expect from a hotel. Also, on our first day, we had been there an hour and was told we was drinking too much because they seen us on our SECOND drink. It’s laughable how bad the hotel is. On arrival, we was charged a €300 deposit, given a long list of rules we need to follow, threatened with being kicked out and threatened with the police being called on us if we did anything wrong. Isn’t a very welcoming arrival if you ask me. It’s like they had already made an opinion on us after 10 minutes of being there. The maids came into our room once so we ran out of toilet paper every day and had to use the same towels for multiple days. The hotels internet didn’t reach our room and we all had 0 signal in the room so couldn’t even use our phones. The hotel staff are useless, it’s like they’ve grabbed anyone from the street to work there. They all lack social skills and can barely string a sentence together. We felt like we was walking on egg shells there the entire time. Every single member of staff at reception was rude, judgemental and a waste of time. They make you wait until 4pm to check in and check out is 11am with no option for a later check out. Honestly you’re better off staying at any other hotel in Albufiera. When we checked out, they took €150 of our €300 deposit off us for no reason, we had caused 0 damage, had 0 complaints and did nothing wrong but they refused to give us the full deposit back. The deposit they take on arrival is 100% a scam. If they don’t like the look of you, they charge you whatever amount they want and you will not get the full deposit back. All the guests we spoke to was nice and friendly, the staff and the hotel is the problem. I could go on for hours how bad the hotel is and give so many more reasons to why you shouldn’t stay here. Don’t waste your money or your holiday staying here. We’re a good group of lads and it’s a shame the hotel decided on our arrival that they didn’t like us and treated us the way they did. It’s laughable that they only gave us half of our deposit back without even checking the room first, which proves it’s a bad scam. I’m not the type of person to write a hotel review or moan about a hotel but do not stay here. I’d put money on it that this hotel gets shut down soon.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,1

The only thing was the kitchen was very poorly equipped not even any wine glasses and only one plug socket. Staff very helpful and friendly and nothing too much trouble.Only downside was that lunch service in the bar was very slow despite the fact that we were often up there on our own.

Hyatt Regency Lisbon,JerryLove,5,JerryLovewrote a review Feb 2023,"The hotel itself is fine.  Staff is very nice, was treated very well.  As a Globalist received suite upgrade as well as free breakfast.  Breakfast was outstanding.  Great selection.Just know that the hotel is not located in the main tourist district.  It's an $8-10 Uber trip to the tourist area.  There is a bus and a tram right in front of the hotel and those are fine options, just know it will take 35ish minutes to get to the heart of the tourist area.The roof-top lounge was closed for construction while I was there in Feb of 2023.  That lounge will certainly offer a nice view once it is open.My frustration is that the Club Lounge is not open.  This is an issue with many Hyatt Regency's, not just the Lisbon location.  Hyatt used Covid as an excuse to close all of the lounges and they have been very slow to reopen.  To be fair, in place of the Club Lounge, the hotel offered 2 tapas and a glass of wine each night in lieu of the Club Lounge.  The tapas were different each night and were all delicious.  I just prefer the Club Lounges and I am unhappy with Hyatt in that regard.",Feb,2023,Feb 2023,2023-02-01,2023,3

The spa is superb as are the treatment facilities.The rooms are extremely well appointed with well equiped  bathrooms and the latest technology in television & lighting. A safe and coffee maker are include as is fast and free w-fi.The restaurant food is outstanding with a good selection of wines at sensible prices. The Aviator bar is comfortable with well prepared drinks and there is a comfortable bar area at the front of the hotel for use in good weather.The hotel is well located for exploring Lisbon yet in a quiet location.Once the minor teething problems are overcome this will be an oustanding boutique hotel.,Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,3

Upon arrival we were received with open arms and everything was explained accordingly. When shown to our room, we were told about the story of the hotel and it’s architecture which made it a very interesting and personal experience. The room itself was gorgeous, we stayed in the Mario Césariny. Besides the looks it was also very clean and cozy. Although small, the balcony was also very beautiful. When asking about restaurants and places to go to, the hotel staff (Tiago) was also extremely kind and very helpful with the suggestions. The pool area was very relaxing and like the rest of the hotel, simply breathtaking. The water was very cold, but on a hot summer day it was exactly what one needed.In conclusion, the hotel was a very unique experience I recommend it a lot.

Saccharum,Annie768,21,Annie768wrote a review Jun 2017,"This hotel was fabulous.  We stayed in one of the bedrooms overlooking the sea on the sixth floor which we were delighted with.  The hotel had everything you needed for a completely relaxing break from the daily grind and all delivered to a very high standard.Breakfast was served in the restaurant on the second floor as well as outside next to the adult only pool area...bit breezy in the morning sometimes but lovely.  Huge choice of fresh, healthy options as well as the usual stuff as you would expect...highly recommend the fresh omelettes or pancakes! Staff were busy but always on hand to help whenever you asked them. Food in the bar area was very good too but we didn't eat much in the hotel apart from breakfast as we preferred to sit on the beach during the day if we weren't out sightseeing and eat at the marina in the evening; my husband didn't bring trousers only shorts and it stipulates trousers to be worn in the restaurants in the evening...this policy feels a bit out of place but it wasn't a big deal.As this was our first time to Madeira we spent a lot of time exploring the island and didn't have as much time as we would like to utilise the hotel amenities ie the Spa / gym and try out all the different bars and restaurants but we will definitely be back and will stay here again.

The breakfast was amazing, smoked salmon, eggs and all the usual fair, a glass of fizz too if you choose! We decided to eat out each evening so cannot comment on the restaurant food. I would highly recommend the fish restaurant and Italian place on the harbour.The staff at this hotel are great, a big shout out to Joe the warm and welcoming door man, and Grace the efficient and friendly waitress. All staff are a credit to the management but these two stand out in the crowd.The rooms are modern and comfortable. A couple of things to consider... The shower has no door so you need to be comfortable with your room mate. The shower is directly opposite the door to the room so I was slightly nervous while taking a shower when there was a knock at the door - I worried the maid and any passing guests would see my birthday suit?! Also, the toilet has a sliding door with a large hole in it so ablutions are not very private! I did struggle with the mirror in the bathroom too. I am short sighted so trying to apply makeup on was a nightmare as the mirror is behind the deep set sink. There was no full length mirror in the room either, this would have made things easier.Would we stay here again? YES YES YES! I would say the hotel is definitely ideal for adults and couples rather than families and we look forward to visiting again..",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4
Villas D. Dinis Charming Residence Adults Only,budgieCardiff,43,budgieCardiffwrote a review Sep 2015,"We had initially booked for 7 nights but stayed for just one. We were a little aprehensive on the approach to this place - lots of half completed, abandoned altogether buildings in the area. Our 'free parking' turned out to be up the road and around the corner - in other words, where ever we could find a space. Our 'apartment' described as having a street view was actually out of the main complex and on the street next to a bar. The only view we had was of great big traveller vans parked up. The room was dark, dismal and despite all of the windows being open smelled stale. To be fair the linen was clean but the beds as hard as nails. Air con turned itself off after a short blast.The furniture in the rooms was very old, the chairs too rickety to sit on and the 'sofa' was made of a few planks of wood nailed to the wall with a thin single matress across.We approched the owner who, it must be said was very pleasant and polite but could not offer us a different room. Having read the positive reviews we were wondering if we were in the same place as those who had given this a high rating - even the pools were too cold to swim in. Wonkey taps, broken light fittings -we certainly did not want to spend another night there. I write this from a fabulous apartment with a full size kitchen,  two gorgeous bedrooms and bathrooms, sitting on a sunny balcony overlooking the pool and the sea. We are so glad we moved!",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,2

From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty.  The rooms are spacious and the view from the balcony was so romantic.  The staff are fantastic so helpful and pleasant.  Fruit and wine arrived in our room not long after we arrived and sweets were left on the bed every evening after the bed had been turned down and bottled water and a glass left by the side of the bed.  On the actual day of our anniversary a bottle of champagne and bowl of strawberries were delivered compliments of the hotel and a candelabra with red candles and ruby coloured glasses were put on our table for our evening meal. The food and the service in the restaurant were exceptional. When you check in you are given 2 cards to give to a member of staff if you think they have given you good service (they are then entered into staff member of the month).  I did not give a card to anyone because I did not have enough cards - every member of the staff that we met deserved one.  WE WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING TO THE ROYAL SAVOY. The only thing to be aware of about this hotel is that it is half way up a hill but then so are a lot of the hotels in Funchal and there are always taxis available.,Apr,2018,Apr 2018,2018-04-01,2018,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Anonymous925,112,Anonymous925wrote a review Oct 2021,"I really like this hotel. The staff was excellent and friendly and the breakfast buffet was extensive. It also seems to be a mainly English speaking hotel. It's in a great location probably a little over a half mile to the Marina and a half mile in the other direction to Quarteria which is more local and to me more enjoyable. The hotel can get noisy as there seems to be a fair amount of late night balcony partying going on which can interrupt your sleep. All in all, a good stay.",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,4

Three issues stand out for me when you consider  this is still meant to be a 5 *hotel .First the standard and quality of training for their seasonal staff which is slipping and therefore the service provided  .Secondly the sunbed issue which is a joke for a  5* establishment and thirdly the issue of luke warm and tasteless tea and coffee in the morning which you should not expect .I alas will not be returning again as its no better than a mediocre 4* now .2 days left of my holiday which I will be spending on the beach as I have done for the previous 5,Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,2

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Vincent D,54,Vincent Dwrote a review Mar 2020,"The location of this hotel is outstanding - right on the beach - but it is very old and run down.  The furniture is cheap and falling apart.  The bedroom is very small, barely enough room to walk on either side of the bed.  There was mold in the closet, probably because of water leaks. On our last day, there was a big rain storm - water leaked into both of our closets, soaking our clothes.  Most of the staff are helpful.  Whenever we asked for extra towels, etc., they were delivered promptly.  The internet worked very well except on the last day, after the storm.  Check in was terrible - the receptionist provided very minimal information and was not very welcoming.  The restaurant staff was very nice; we even met the chef and he was very determined to ensure everyone was happy despite the restrictions due to COVID-19.  There was an old beach umbrella and trash in the corner right outside our front door.  Overall, there didn't seem to be much care, concern, or pride regarding the physical condition of the units.",Mar,2020,Mar 2020,2020-03-01,2020,2

The staff were helpful when needed which wasn't often.The breakfast was plentiful with champagne if you so desired.The location is great , by the river and a short walk to the riverside bars, the port lodges and the boat trips. It  is also near to the funicular if you don't fancy walking up the steps to the Old Town.I would give it 5 stars except for the barman who wouldn't serve me a rum and coke as it wasn't on the drinks menu. All the ingredients behind the bar but as it didn't come on the cocktail list it was not allowed.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Dannyvb,55,Dannyvbwrote a review Jul 2024,"Nice hotel with a pleasant pool. The children's entertainment is great.The service at the bar near the pool is not really smooth, you have to be patient. The hotel has a nice lobby and is neat. The staff friendly.The only downside are the rooms that are not optimally kept just. When checking in to our room there were still dirty glass prints on the glass of the bedside table. The bathrooms old-fashioned. Blankets are provided on the beds .... Blankets are certainly not always washed ..... I have never seen them removed from a room during our stay. These should be duvet covers.There is a small fridge in the room but that is not replenished ....After a few days it was ..... empty. Upon arrival in the room there was a bottle of water put ready on the table (for three people?). The rest of our stay we did not see any bottles of water in the room which for a 4* hotel should be a daily service.Breakfast was the same extensive buffet every day. Again helpful and friendly staff but some small variations in the buffet would be welcome.If you sleep in, you can expect to have to wait in a queue at the entrance of the breakfast restaurant.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,3

It is exquisitely clean. The staff are unobtrusive, just popping up when you need them. Extreme courtesy from everyone including the chambermaids (who are like fairies in and out without being seen!) and the owner who likes to meet everyone at some point during their stay. The breakfasts and snack lunches were lovely. Nothing was too much trouble. Beautiful pool and peaceful location despite the fact you can walk through the back gate and be right in the middle of the old town restaurant life. Would go back time and again.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Lauren P,1,Lauren Pwrote a review Jul 2025,"We booked our holiday to Albufeira Portugal at Clube Praia da Oura after seeing it advertised as popular with groups of friends and families'. When we arrived to the resort, there were party goers asleep in the reception at 12pm in the afternoon. Checking in took around 25-30minutes per group due to the very long process. We were told our room was not ready and would be around 5pm - completely fine as we were made aware by travel reps that this would be the case. However, the storage facility for suitcases/luggage was completely full and overflowing into the reception - no security/locked away units for storage to go.Once we checked in, instructions were unclear of where to go to find our room, leading to a 25 minute treasure hunt around the hotel to find the room. Once we found the room, it was not what it looked like on the photos. We booked 'Deluxe Terrace room with pool or sea view'. The images show a spacious room when it was small & hard to move around. The door hit the toilet when opening, making it difficult to access. The only perk of the room was that it was overlooking the sea.After two nights, we realised that we would not be able to sleep due to our neighbours being unruly & extremely loud. Often playing music on personal speakers, ringing doorbells, shouting & jumping in the pool at early hours of the morning (4am).  The hotel lacked in general security as a whole. The staff seem completely overwhelmed with the amount of people it holds, with little security presence.The area itself was faultless, but the hotel was extremely disappointing in facilities & staffing levels. We ate in the hotel 3 times but there was not a variety. Mainly just a meat, fish in sauce or pasta. The boat bar during the day was nice, serving different meats, hotdogs & fresh fruit.It was almost impossible to get a sun lounger or a seat around the pool as it was overrun with groups of young lads/girls causing chaos and creating for an uncomfortable atmosphere. It is hard to see how a family with children would be able to enjoy this resort due to noise, accessibility and general atmosphere.Whilst we were at the resort, we noticed many other people had the same issues with noise/disturbances throughout the night and were often complaining to staff.",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,2

Casa Vela Boutique House,bioniccouple,34,bioniccouplewrote a review Oct 2018,"First of all Casa Vela is a guest house, so if you want a swanky hotel with room service, robes etc this is not for you.It is located in a residential area away from the busy town center of Cascais.It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the beautiful beach and town center. Coming back is a bit of an uphill walk.We were warmly welcomed by Jean Paul, Nadia and the rest of the staff and given a tour of \"the House\". Throughout our stay the staff was very helpful with suggestions for local restaurants etc.The whole house was kept spotlessly clean.Our room was Mozambique. We had to go down a flight of stairs and along a dark hallway to get to our room, but once there it opened onto a balcony where we could step out into the garden. The room was large bright and modern. The bathroom arrangement was a bit odd but it worked. A refrigerator would have been a real plus. But then again this is a guest house!The gardens and pool are beautiful and well kept; a real oasis.The lounge in the old part of the house is lovely and charming with it's honesty bar.Breakfast was very good; a nice selection of fresh fruit, some hot food, pastries & bread including some of the best croissants I have ever had. The only improvement would be to add a second coffee machine. It could get quite congested.On our last day we had to seek medical attention as my husband had a persistent cough & fever. The staff were very concerned & helpful finding us a clinic.I am happy to report he's had a full recovery.Obrigada.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

I do this for all my reviews. The 5 I give this hotel does not make it comparable to a Ritz Carlton, but it is an upper range 3* hotel.)The metro is literally across the street (red and blue lines) where you can get to the city center in 10 minutes, and El Corte Ingles (shopping) is just a three minute walk away. So the location is good.The room was super clean, and it was cleaned every day. Not a large room but standard European size. Beds, flat screen tv, and bathroom were all great. Zero issues with the free wifi.For the price, we paid 45usd/night including breakfast. Can't beat that at all. Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, meats and cheeses, and juice/coffee. No complaints.I recommend this hotel if you want a convenient, clean, well located, and reasonably priced room in Lisbon.",Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,4

Hotel Principe Lisboa,TravelGirl181747,138,TravelGirl181747wrote a review Dec 2018,"This hotel is an easy walk from the San Sebastiao Metro station. It is one train directly from the airport. The trick to finding the hotel is which exit you use to leave the station. There are 2 lines that pass through this station, blue and red. If you exit directly from the red line, one escalator and 3 flights of stairs, you will end up directly in front of the hotel. If you try to take the elevator, you will not have to navigate the stairs but you will end up a few streets away from the hotel.The check in process was simple and the staff friendly. The room was spacious and clean. However, for some reason, the lobby and first floor where the breakfast room is situated, are HEAVILY scented with some sort of air freshener. It was really off-putting and a strong enough reason not to stay at this property again. This is a shame because it was otherwise a lovely place. I am not normally affected by this sort of thing but the scent was so strong that I feel it necessary to mention. Had this not been the case, I would have rated the property a 4 or possibly even a 5.Breakfast, aside from the air freshener situation, was lovely.",Dec,2018,Dec 2018,2018-12-01,2018,4

Main points: excellent breakfast, both in relation to the room and to the food variety and quality; excellent outside pool, with a good size, clean water and nice temperature (24 celsius). Large bedroom (5th floor suite for a couple with two kids) with good equipment. Only (minor) downside this time: banging bedroom doors, which we could listen very distinctively in the morning in our bed when people are leaving their rooms. Annoying sound, not strong enough to wake people up, but still annoying if you are in your bed waking up slowly and this strong sound happens every 10 seconds.
