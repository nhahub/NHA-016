Quinta Mirabela,Jess1980,1,Jess1980wrote a review Oct 2006,I have just returned from the Quinta Mirabella and couldn't fault it. On arrival we were offered an upgrade and invited to have welcome drinks the next day on the terrace. We were then personally shown to our room and the receptionist explained how everything worked.We used the pool and spa facilities a couple of times in two weeks as there is so much to see that we didn't want to waste our whole holiday sat by the pool area. I recommend getting a car to get around as it is a long way down and back up from Funchal and the hotel restaurant is very expensive so it's worth venturing out into the Zona Velha for a meal.Breakfast was mainly continental with a few items of hot food kept in warmers. However this is made fresh early on so if you want this option you have to be prepared to be up early when it's still at it's best.On returning to the UK I received a personal email from the management thanking me for my stay at the Mirabella and it was this along with the fact that they always welcomed us by name when we returned from a day out that really made it stand out.Madeira is a lovely country with lots of breathtaking scenery and well worth exploring. It has something for everyone both young and old.,Oct,2006,Oct 2006,2006-10-01,2006,5
Saccharum,AnnikaHe,2,AnnikaHewrote a review Mar 2016,"We have just returned from a fantastic holiday, staying 6 nights at the Saccharum in Madeira. We could not be happier with all of the hotel's facilities. Ultra-modern room with a sea view, a fantastic spa, wonderful food and great service. We are keen swimmers and the hotel has a couple of outdoor pools, a private beach and also an indoor pool in the Spa. We are already planning our next stay there. Can't wait!",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Delgado2020,0,Delgado2020wrote a review Aug 2020,we booked 3 rooms with 9 people. price and quality are a big difference. this hotel does not meet our expectation. we will never come back here. Food is generally bland and little variety. cleaning in the rooms was very poorly arranged. The local drink is of poor quality and for the good drinks you have to pay what was not stated in our booking. For half of our vacation the rooftop bar and the outside restaurant / bar were closed due to low occupancy. We are ready for vacation again after this bad adventure.,Aug,2020,Aug 2020,2020-08-01,2020,2

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,RazorCork,50,RazorCorkwrote a review Aug 2024,"I would highly recommend a stay here. We booked a two bedroom apartment with a roof terrace. The apartment was not only spacious but very well equipped with every type of cooking utensil you could need.The apartment was cleaned regularly and the towels were changed often too.The swimming pools were great and there was never an issue getting a lounger.Points to note and why I didn’t give 5 stars- the sauna was out of action for much of our stay, the Turkish bath was never in operation and many of the features in the spa did not work. This wasn’t a big issue for us but if you wanted to use these then it would be disappointing.The nearest supermarket is approximately 15 min walk up a steep hill.Overall we had a great stay and I would highly recommend.",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,4

PortoBay Serra Golf,Rolf-Erik N,5,Rolf-Erik Nwrote a review Jan 2015,"This is on the top of the mountains (something I really found out after cycling down to the sea and back up). Steeper hills are rare to find. But this was a place we went to as it was our last day and it was close to the airport. The hotel is simple and practical, nice restaurant, friendly, but in the restaurant, a little unfocused staff. The food was unfortunately too bland. Rooms standard. Nice with pool outside the door. Beautiful scenery!. As mentioned, if you borrow a bike, do not, like me, cycel to the ocean. The climbing back up was beautiful, but hell.

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,BWD,43,BWDwrote a review May 2018,"I had enjoyed a regular golf trip based at another hotel nearby (Formosa Park) and as before my wife joined me when the others left.We had previously “upgraded” to the Ria Park which was lovely but thought we’d try Dona Filipa due to reputation and location.The staff were lovely and the room was well-appointed so everything looked good. Unfortunately the air conditioning was ridiculously noisy to the extent that it was impossible to sleep and if we switched it off and left the balcony doors open we suffered noisy drunken guests returning through the night until around 4.00. When I complained and asked if they could just make sure that guests were reasonably sensible I was offered a room away from where we were. I pointed out that this was hardly addressing the two problems and why should someone else take our room when it was more or less uninhabitable?Anyway, we stayed in that room for the sake of others and won’t return.At the price the pool is ridiculously small, the terrace crowded and the restaurant not great. I would choose the Ria Park in the price range every time.If you just want a decent clean room with a fair breakfast and a great pool then the Formosa Park is about half the price and QUIET!",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,2
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Samantha J,84,Samantha Jwrote a review Sep 2016,"We stayed here from 5th-9th September all inclusive. We arrived on the Monday at about 12pm ish we were told we couldn't get our bands until 4pm we were very disappointed but we did get our dinner on the last day. The pool bar didn't open until 12pm so if you think from breakfast til 12 you cant have a drink. The food was not 5 star food at all, the night we arrived the food was cold and we were down at the time it opens and not much to choose from only about 5 main dishes. The apartment is brilliant, very big and has everything you need for being self catering, with us being all inclusive we never used any of it.Me and my boyfriend have never been to a 5 star hotel before so were very much looking forward to it but there is a lot of wear and tear with the place. In the pool we must have found about 10 tiles that had come off, there was a massive patch were loads had come off. The pool maintenance man at 10am was hose piping were all the sunbeds are so you would get wet.I wouldn't recommend coming all inclusive, defiantly go self catering loads of restaurants about 10 mins away.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,2

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Michael Frederi... K,37,Michael Frederi... Kwrote a review Sep 2012,Not a good visit from start to finish.  Very slow check-in with robotic and probably exhausted receptionist.  Returned from a night out to see the line still long with long faces on the customers that were waiting.  Room a little small but the bathroom was updated.  No WiFi in room and a hefty charge for it in the lobby.  Fitness room bike was broken and unkept.  The women who was working out in the dark said she call to get the lights on but that was 15 mins ago.  Breakfast was very good with a large selection.  Moved to another hotel for the rest of the trip.,Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,2
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Alan C,56,Alan Cwrote a review Oct 2024,"We love Madeira and have previously stayed at the Cliff Bay (and Cliff Bay Suites) , which are excellent , but this time we wanted to see if Reids lives up to its reputation.The short answer is that it very largely does .The setting is beautiful and our room had a gorgeous view over the bay and towards the town. Magical sunrises/ sunsets and the lights of Funchal at night.The room itself was very comfortable , with the best bed linen I have ever experienced.We both slept so well. Plentiful coffee and soft drinks provided free .Good bathroom with quality toiletries.In general service is excellent , subject to some issues with orders at breakfast . For the most part , staff are charming and very helpful .The food at breakfast is terrific , both in terms of quality and variety. We also dined in the Gastrobar , and the open air fish restaurant , both of which were superb.One of the highlights of our stay was tea on the terrace- fabulous service and setting.We also greatly enjoyed the classical /jazz concert in the dining room from the excellent classical orchestra of Madeira.This is a truly special hotel and we certainly intend to return .",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,sbj3,107,sbj3wrote a review Jan 2014,"A very pleasant hotel which is well used by tour parties (counted five buses at one count).  The hotel is very large but you do not feel that you are just \"one of a crowd\".We had a very nice silver service dinner in the restaurant one evening, and on other occasions our tour party was served in another dining room where there was plenty of selection.The hotel is located a distance from the city, but there are markets within walking distance if you fancy shopping.The internet can only be accessed intermittently in the foyer.",Jan,2014,Jan 2014,2014-01-01,2014,4

Food was good, especially the all you can eat pasta buffet which I had several of the nights I was there!There is a bridge near the hotel and a small cafe the other side which we visited one morning and a lovely fish restaurant nearby. Its isolated from the centre but there are things around if you are willing to walk for 10 minutes.I am a conference AV Technician and we worked in the venue and found the C&B staff to be good and well organised. I would not hesitate to come here again for business though I'm not sure I would book the hotel for a social visit purely because of its isolation from the hussle and bussle!",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,4
Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,Tiffany S,0,Tiffany Swrote a review Sep 2014,"The Algarve Surf Hostel was by far the favourite of the 5 we stayed at for our 10 day road trip along the coast in Portugal!Stacy and Dex are super friendly and were very helpful with booking fun things to do while we were in Lagos. We booked a 3 hour kayak along the beaches and through the caves with Kayak Tours and a day of surf lessons at the Algarve Surf Camp. Both were awesome!First night we were there (Monday) the entire Hostel went out for dinner together where we got wasted off sangria and bar hopped. Everyone in the hostel got along really well, it was such a good atmosphere, like everyone had been friends for much longer. 3 of us girls scattered in a room with 3 guys between 3 bunks was not uncomfortable in the slightest, like one big family.Hostel provides breakfast each day and bags to make sandwiches for lunches. Wednesday night Dex's friend cooked a delicious dinner for everyone for only 8 euros each.....we got wasted and pub crawled again.Was sad to say goodbye to Lagos and our friends at the surf hostel, especially to Dex. I am jealous of your life, but at the same time I fear for your liver (as well as my own). Thanks for helping us find a hostel in Sagres after we found out the Surf hostel was booked solid. Funky Monkey has a lot of character, super chill, was basically a bunch of surf dudes letting strangers crash at their place and party.You won't be disappointed if you decide to stay at the Algarve Surf Hostel, I can promise you that.Cheers,\"The Canadians\"",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5
Casa Mitchell Apartments,Ruth B,43,Ruth Bwrote a review Jul 2016,"We were delighted with these apartments. The cleanliness and friendly atmosphere was excellent. We had room 63 which is quite roomy,although the balcony is a little small. The pool area is kept spotless and has plenty of sunbeds around the small pool. The position of these apartments is really handy for the beach,old town and bars and restaurants. There are hills and steps but nothing too difficult. The room is well equipped with a hob microwave fridge toaster kettle iron air conditioning and Internet. The bed was very comfortable and the linen and towels changed regularly. We used the shop on the corner for basics and walked to the Inter Marche on Sir Cliff Richard road for other items. We had very reasonable priced snacks in Leo,s over the road and enjoyed a cocktail in Merlin,s down the road. We tried lots of restaurants and always had good food.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Kays Chowdhury,27,Kays Chowdhurywrote a review Jul 2022,"I stayed in Marriott Lisbon from 30th June till the 2nd July as part of the group of UN Ocean Conference. Honestly I srayed many Marriott un many countries as part of delegation. I must say this is the worst ever Marriott I have ever stayed. Majority Hotels staffs are not friendly or cooperative at all. Very few are really helpful unfortunately hardly you may see them. i was stuck in the lift for 25 mins! I  called reception at least 10 times unfortunately there wasnt any answer. I had called the emergency number what was there and all three times were attended however they advised me to wait until I got rescued. There was a man who came by the lift door and advised me to wait, I requested him to get the music in the lift switched off so I can talk as it was very loud and I requested to keep the Fan on if possible,  unfortunately that man neither could off the music speakers or switch on the Fan!!  It was a nightmare and a breathtaking session for me. I became mentally so weak that I called and delayed my flight. It was so sad not a single staff of the hotel came to me and give apology or showed any sympathy. I got shocked there was not hotel duty manager or hotel manager who came to me and explained the situation.  A lady name Jessica at reception was so helpful and extended my check out time till 3pm as I wasnt mentally ready to fly back to London!  Thank you Jessica for your help. From Hotel like Marriott it is never expected,  I call the very senior management to look in to the situation and investigate. A Simple lift break down is handled so unprofessionally and poorly that rings the bell of the whole Hotel management, I was just thinking if it was a major fire or disaster how the Hotel would handle. I am planning to write to Portugal and Lisbon high official to look this matrer if hotel doesnt come back to me with explanation and apology.  At least as a guest of hotel I deserve to receive an sincere apology for their unprofessional actions.",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,1

This is a family friendly hotel. I can't give it 5 stars, for a couple of reasons.

Cloud 9 Hostel,Jacob C,0,Jacob Cwrote a review Jul 2016,"Me and my mate have been travelling Europe for the holidays and stubbled across Cloud 9. The staff accepted us immediately as part of the family, showing us around and giving us all the essential knowledge of the town. Skye ran a nightly pub crawl, which never disappointed. Cheap drink deals and the best knowledge of bars and clubs is what makes the bar hopping tour the best, not to mention how down to earth and kind Skye is. We stayed here for 6 nights and every single night we went out on the bar hopping tour it got better and better. Paulo who works the night shift was always helpful in assisting us safely to our rooms when needed after the late nights. We have made life long friends from Cloud 9 as everyone is part of one big hostel family, will be back next year for sure!

Royal Savoy Hotel,DurhamCastle,21,DurhamCastlewrote a review Nov 2015,"I have a one bedroom apartment on the carousel but recently decided to have a week in October in a studio. Now the studios are furnished and decorated in the same style as the larger rooms albeit naturally much smaller. The kitchen is very small and as a result if you are cooking a meal a little bit of pre-planning around the area is required. The fridge is also very small. A small balcony has a table and two chairs but room only for one lounger.I have to say during our week (Oct 19th) the weather was warm but wet, 5 days of rain which resulted in an issue with bugs and mosquitoes in and around hotels on the island. Our best experiences in the hotel was two meals in the Armada restaurant. We went again to the \"Wok night\", several choices of meat and sea food plus a variety of vegetables that you choose from a buffet style display. Once chosen you take your plate to the Chef who cooks in front of you. I have to say that this was the best meal of its type I have ever had. The wine we had was good but pricey. A similar bottle in a nearby restaurant was 12 euros cheaper. The Italian Night has become a \"must do\" final night holiday meal and again is a choice of a hot buffet meal or a Chef cooked Pasta meal. Again a superb meal. Watching the chefs gives you an idea of the skills and simplicity they bring to cooking high quality food. The waiters were superb and attentive. After having having my \"sweet\" and waiters clearing my plate and cutlery away I decided to have a final treat of melon. As I sat down a waiter, Miguel was placing fresh cutlery for me to eat that meal, excellent observation and service. On both these nights the Armada was full, indicating the very good quality of food, service and dining experience on offer. Breakfast is buffet style but a similar standard is to be found in many four star hotels. What is substandard are the sausages, seemingly mass produced and tasteless, merely a \"filler\" on the plate. Management needs to improve on these.While I seem to \"wax lyrical about \"The Royal\" I know things can and do go wrong but the hotel is at the forefront of being among the best on the island. As a footnote, naturally a one bed apartment is far superior to a studio and I look forward to returning to ours in May.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4

I like a bit of life in the evening and enjoyed the nightly entertainment in the Piano bar and made some wonderful friends.  Food was very good in the hotel but also so many great restaurants and bars close by.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,KCBUILD,50,KCBUILDwrote a review May 2017,"This has been my first visit to the Crowne Plaza, and after staying in other nearby hotels, I don't think it will be my last.Upon arrival, although we were early, our room was ready, and our luggage was whisked off to the room.Room was very spacious, really large bed, great bathroom and shower.  Some nice toiletries.  You also got 2 small bottles of complimentary water each day of your stay. Hotel room also had a coffee maker.  Hairdryer in bathroom was small, but powerful enough for most people.Breakfast had a huge choice, and I cannot see how anyone would not be able to find a great choice for themselves.  From healthy options to full english, they had it all including champagne.Pool area is lovely, the only suggestion I would have would be to perhaps heat the outdoor pool if possible.  Although we had lovely weather, the pool was very cold and therefore massively under used.Towels for the pool area are supplied via reception, and they always had plenty.As we stayed on a B&B basis, we had lunch either at the poolside bar or you could sit on the terrace.  Lots of options to choose from.We set up a tab so no need to carry cash, although, like other reviews, drinks are expensive, however, the majority of the higher end bars and restaurants at the Marina are a similar cost.Hotel is an easy stroll to the Marina where you will find a great selection of restaurants, bars and small shops.There is a Spar less than 2 minutes walk from the hotel, they have lots of produce etc, and even a small deli at the rear of the shop.  The bar next to the Spar shop does a good selection of beers, cocktails etc and they cost a lot less than the hotel.We didn't use the spa as we felt the cost of the treatments was extremely expensive.  The spa area did look nice, and they also have a gym, but as we prefer to run, it was great to have good weather and enjoyed the outdoor running.The staff in the hotel are very friendly and always happy to help with any requests you may have.All in all a wonderful holiday was had by all and we wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4

Firstly the standard of cleanliness is exceptional. Our room had the perfect sea view. The rooms also have a fridge, microwave, toaster and kettle so you can make snacks or breakfast to enjoy on your terrace. However, the breakfast you can buy here ( 8 euros each) is great - cooked eggs of your choice (great omelettes) or the usual continental fare with lots of fresh fruit, meats and a delicious cake freshly baked on site every day!Oh and by the way - the beds and pillows are really comfortable!We hope to return next year - O Castelo is a great find and in the perfect location in Carvoeiro.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

I did find some things rather expensive in the resort like a large sprite (draft) 4 euros a club sandwich 12.5 euros but it is big enough for 2. I found most of the cleaners really good there is the odd one by the end of the day not taking pride in their work but on the whole really comfortable room breakfast was very good although some guests were unable to comprehend that the coffee machines were different and that there was more than one queue and some guests decided not to follow protocol on face masks. Other than that recommended. I also have to give a shout out for the pool guy, really takes pride in his work and does a really good job even under pressure from an over officious manager that only showed her face when a wedding was due to take place and then proceed to tell the pool guy to dry out the cup holders on the beds, really is that necessary!!",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,4

Hotel Travel Park Lisboa,maplecream,18,maplecreamwrote a review Jun 2010,"This is a really decent hotel that is in a good location for exploring the city. The rooms were clean, the staff were friendly and fairly helpful, and the breakfast was great. What we liked is that the hotel is near the Anjos metro stop, which is central and convenient for getting about. It's also handy to the airport - a cab was 12-15 Euros and under 20 minutes. Although the hotel website doesn't indicate that the rooms are air conditioned, they have a good cooling system. It was 30 degrees out while we were in Lisbon, and our room was very comfortable. It was also quiet. Two very minor things which we did notice were 1) the safe required a deposit and a small fee to use it and 2) they charge you to use the internet on the computer in the lobby. Nonetheless, we would definitely stay here again and we enjoyed our stay.",Jun,2010,Jun 2010,2010-06-01,2010,4

Ocean Gardens,Liz B,73,Liz Bwrote a review Oct 2013,"Just back from 7 nights at the Ocean Gardens.  The hotel and grounds are immaculately kept.  We booked via Trivago and had a good deal on 7 nights B & B with an upgraded room - the views from the superior rooms are outstanding and have the sun from midday till sunset.  Bed was a bit on the hard side but had no problems sleeping.  Bedding and towels changed daily and the room, although a bit tired in places, was very clean.  Plenty of hot water, hairdryer and fridge provided in the room but no tea or coffee making facilities so take your own travel kettle if you like a cuppa!  Breakfast was ok although same each day which would definitely be a problem for longer than a 7 night holiday.  We ate twice in the a la carte restaurant - good service and again great views but food a bit hit and miss and on the expensive side.We knew before booking that this hotel was out of town and we did go into Funchal each day, sometimes by bus and sometimes by taxi - travel does add up so you need to be aware of this if you decide to stay in the Ocean Gardens.  There is a snack bar only about a 5 mins walk downhill from the hotel, which we went to a couple of times for cheap eats and drinks - well worth the walk - no menu but the owner will cook you whatever fresh food she has on the day.  As others have mentioned, there is no footpath and you will need to walk on the edge of the road - we didn't find this a problem and the road is well lit.All in all, a great place to stay in Madeira as long as you don't mind a bit of traveling - enjoy!",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,4

Before arriving I emailed the hotel and requested flowers and a bottle of campagne to be in the room when we got there.  The flowers were beautiful and the champagne was provide as a gift from the hotel.  I also booked the restaurant which was also fabulous .. when we walked in the staff wished my mum a happy birthday and she received a cake too.  (Briliant touch)The hotel was lovely and clean,  the breakfast was also good - nothing fancy but its a hotel breakfast so no complaints on that score.The hotel has a beautiful rooftop garden with a pool  / saune / jacuzzi to all immaculate.On the last day our flight was not until 19.00 and check out was 12.00 however the hotel allowed us to keep the room until 17.00 at no extra charge.There is a (free) hotel bus that is run twice a day but in addition to this there is a bus stop outside the hotel and these run every hour (ask at reception for th timetable) you can buy a weekly bus ticket for 21 euro's - well worth it as you can use all over the island.  it takes approx 15 min on the bus to get into the centre of Funchal.The cost of the taxi from the airport to the hotel was 25 euro's - bargain as some of the companies charge that per person ...",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,3

You can only get all inclusive drinks from one bar from noon-10pm.Breakfast buffet was good and can't complain.Lunch and Dinner has a very poor and small selection of meals and doesn't change much. You can get drinks with lunch and dinner but are served in very small glasses (breakfast juice glasses)There is plenty of restaurants outside the hotel that are affordable. We were a group of 21, family and friends we end up eating out for lunch and dinner the rest of our stay as the all inclusive lunch and dinner was awful.Staff at the reception are rude and slow service.

ibis Styles Lisboa Centro Liberdade NE,bonii_vivek,52,bonii_vivekwrote a review Apr 2015,"The hotel is a good budget hotel located right next to Marques Pombal square. It is centrally located to all the major attractions. The rooms were large and spacious and clean. The breakfast spread was decent. The lifts were slightly on the slower side and would not be a problem unless you have a lot of luggage.We stayed there for two days and the day we checked into our room, we saw our air conditioner was not working (which is a must in Lisbon). As we were leaving for our sight-seeing in the afternoon, we notified the reception who said they will take care of it. When we came back at night, it was still not working. We notified the problem again and a hotel staff came in who spoke limited English. He kept on gesturing that it was broken and asked us to stay put in the room since there was no other room and they had no technicians available then. It was extremely hot so he opened a really large window and said \"Its like camping\". We had to go downstairs to the manager who kept saying the hotel was full. In the end, we had to be really forceful before he changed our rooms. The whole incident in my opinion could have been completely avoided.Overall, I liked the hotel but the whole incident left a bad taste in my mouth.",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,3
Hilton Porto Gaia,DTV83,17,DTV83wrote a review Jan 2025,"Excellent hotel, in the one that was our first visit.Being acquaintances and fans of Quinta da Boeira, from the same group, we were surprised and many satisfied with what we found in this hotel.With an exceptional location, next to the Cais de Gaia, complemented by an excellent underground parking lot (large and easily accessible), the hotel has a fantastic presentation, with a very well decorated hotel lobby and reception with very high ceilings.We were very well received at the reception, with quick check-in and access to the room with a very nice panoramic elevator.Large room, larger than in Quinta da Boeira but with several elements in common and the same quality of shape.Unfortunately due to bad weather, the spa and indoor pool were more crowded than expected and we did not get a vacancy in the intended period on the day of arrival. It was one of the reasons for booking and choosing the hotel, but it will stay for a next stay, which will surely be repeated several times.Room with bed and cushions very comfortable, absolute silence during the entire stay. Room Service letter similar to Quinta da Boeira (point to point) and food prepared quickly and with very intuitive ordering system can be made online via the App, without the need for a phone call.Exceptional breakfast. One of the best in any 5-star hotel, wide variety, very large and comfortable room.Dream stay to repeat several times.Nothing negative to point out. There was a detail of preparation in the room where the coffee cups were not placed in the room upon arrival, but exemplary settled after contact with the reception.An exceptional hotel, undoubtedly recommended and we hope to be able to return as soon as possible.A great offer from the Hilton chain alongside Quinta da Boeira, with a choice of stays of the highest level in the city of Gaia.",Jan,2025,Jan 2025,2025-01-01,2025,5

Hotel Principe Lisboa,Jeff D,3,Jeff Dwrote a review Jul 2016,"This hotel is extremely easy to get to from the airport. It's a straight line on the metro, and the hotel is right across the road from exiting the metro! It then serves as a nice base for exploring Lisboa as it's a quick (and direct) metro ride on the blue line to some fantastic neighborhoods.The hotel itself is clean and the front desk staff (they speak English) are professional and helpful. We liked our room and enjoyed the continental breakfast in the morning. The rooms are spacious. Frankly, if this hotel were in any American city, it would be way more expensive.The hotel's neighborhood is safe. However, it doesn't offer much for exploration. So if you are the type of person who likes to stay right in the middle of it all, then this place is not for you. If you're like us and are comfortable taking a short metro ride to \"it all\" then this location is perfect! Do note that the Metro is extremely easy to use in Lisbon.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4

After 3 nights there i think i won't be back. Prepare you self to check in only by 16h00. Exactly not even 5 minutes before it, rather 15 minutes after as it happened to us. They send us to wait 20 minutes in the Bar without even asking if we would like a drink or how was our trip (it takes 2h45m from Lisbon). Escorted to the Bungalow they left us at the entrance without showing the inside. The pool size is amazing small and too much crowded if the Hotel is busy at it is in August. No chair available at thr very tigh lawn. Pool nevertheless was very good (couldn't be more warm). Don't look at the glass bu the pool as they are soo dirty (one even has the hand written size on it !). First day at reception the girl said to us if we would like to have dinner should make reservation on the upcoming days, as for the first day they were full so it was impossible for us to have dinner there....for a guest should this happen??! On the next day and the following they only came to clean up the room by 17h00/18h00. So imagine to have the room in a mess the whole day. They have lack on employes so they can not deliver service at a 4 star category hotel. Inside the bugalow there was no towel to clean kitchen elements. We had to use a towel from the bathroom. The bungalow was full of flyes. Horrible, By the pool there wer band aids and tissues for several day without bening removed. The huge glass at the entrance was dirty during all our stay. The cleaning ladies wear their at home clothes, with no proper Hotel uuniform. Honestly there are few good things to talk about our stay: friendly staff and nice building. But that isn´t enough for a good stay, ins't it ? I couldn't be more disapointed. They said they will change by next year, but that is wrong: you have to change today,",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,2

Hotel dos Templarios,666DINO999,180,666DINO999wrote a review Nov 2023,"Large hotel, around 170 rooms. Upon my arrival, cold and very formal reception, as for the good sized room (standard), very good bathroom and plentiful amenities. It is already a hotel that shows the weight of its age, carpeted floors already showing a lot of signs of use and in some places with stains. Indoor pool very small for the size of the hotel. Good sized outdoor pool but few sun loungers for the number of rooms, and with little or no shadows. Another important aspect is that it is a hotel dedicated to mass tourism, groups and very large ones, so don't expect attentive service. Breakfast with plenty of variety but of average quality. Restaurant staff, they don't even say good morning to the customer, they lift dishes without asking, they say information about something about the items at cost and in a cold and dry way, as if they were doing a favor, but I found that this was a general rule for all hotel staff. Despite being a hotel with good facilities, I don't recommend it. There are already other hotel units in Tomar with the same 4-star rating with MUCH more refinement, and above all they are not dedicated to GROUPS to make the hotel profitable.",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,2
