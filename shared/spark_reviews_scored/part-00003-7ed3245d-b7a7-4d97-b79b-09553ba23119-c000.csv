Vila Gale Collection Braga,C H,113,C Hwrote a review Jun 2019,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The hotel has two sections, a 500 year old converted hospital, which has been converted aesthetically and authentically and a modern block behind with high quality rooms. There is parking and a spa.The rooms are well apportioned, modern and comfortable and the old part of the hotel contains a bar and restaurant.The breakfast buffet will set you up for the day, omelette station, fresh pastries, fruit, etc.....Staff friendly and kind.Really enjoyed our stay",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,5
Penedo da Saudade Suites & Hostel,Anfrist,433,Anfristwrote a review Oct 2019,"This is located in a quaint area with villas, up the hill. The building is nice and the rooms are even nicer. Being on the side kf the building meant an irregular room with balcony all around and classical system of blindfolding. The views are fantastic from the long balcony. Everything in the room is carefully selected. For the price it was a really great experience. The room on the rooftop where the breakfast is served is very beautiful, breakfast selection is decent.On the cons, I had to wait for the check in for 25 minutes as it was very slow for 1 person and 1 group ahead. This was frustrating because the check-in hours are limited, 3 to 5 ,and we skipped some attractions to be there before 5, which proved pointless. Also, it has a dormitory for hostel underground and due to poor isolation we were awaken at 5 in the morning on a Thursday by energetic guests returning from the city and loudly chatting and laughing on ground floor. Noise from the street is small problem as there is little traffic, but again phonic isolation issues.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,3

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,LondonLucyA,60,LondonLucyAwrote a review Jun 2012,"We stayed at the Belmar for 5 nights in one of the studios. The resort itself is spotless and the apartments are very well equipped but the hotel was a bit too lacking personality for us. We wanted a quiet few days after driving down from Lisbon and quiet it was! We never saw any one in the bar ( inside near reception, apparently there is a pool bar but it is not open yet) or restaurant, it was lacking a buzz . We had a hire car and I have to say if we didn't I would have felt really trapped as there are only 2 restaurants near by on the beach and the Belmar appears to be in a residential backwater with Lagos town centre is quite a trek away.  Again I can not fault the standard of apartment but feel they are really missing a trick and this could be a fantastic place to stay.  Would not return purely due to location and lack of any kind of buzz",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,2

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Nigel and Philippa Payne,77,Nigel and Philippa Paynewrote a review Aug 2021,This hotel was quite good so let me say that first of all. The view is stunning and the staff are very good.But it suffered from several things that many hotels do when on holiday.- there were not enough sun beds by some way- beds get reserved and that is never policed- the rooms are quite small- car parking is difficult with the car park often full- some of the walls and skirting boards were quite dirtyOverall this was a reasonable stay. But it is more 3 or maybe 4 star.,Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,3
Vila Gale Porto Ribeira,mediterraneovero,42,mediterraneoverowrote a review Jul 2018,"I stayed two nights in the Vila Galé which opened only 8 months ago. The personnel is very kind, breakfast is excellent. It is very well furnished and decorated. It is located by the river close from the center (watch out you may need to climb a bit if you choose to walk to the higher part of the city).",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,5
Hotel Madeira,Karen G,65,Karen Gwrote a review Sep 2017,"Just returned from 2 weeks at the Hotel Madeira. It is a lovely small hotel in an ideal location - on the flat, quite unusual in Funchal. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Many of the guests there had been many times to the same hotel, which says more than my words can say.The hotel has a small pool and snack bar on the roof and our only issue was that they allow non-residents to use the bar and most days there were several teenagers taking up the tables in this small area, drinking one small coffee each over several hours. This appears to be something new this year and hopefully management will reverse this decision, leaving sufficient room for residents to eat meals or have their drinks in peace. Although this was an inconvenience it won't stop us booking again for next year.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,2
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,PeterPatriciaF,12,PeterPatriciaFwrote a review May 2025,"We stayed in this hotel before that in the north for 4 nights after that for 5 nights. The hotel lives on the location, that was pretty much all.It has come of age, everything old, beds, furniture and bathrooms. Bed linen had holes, even the bath towel, that doesn't work. Drinking water was never replenished. In heavy rain, the water ran into the room. Breakfast ok, also the dinner was good, but the room has absolutely no atmosphere, but views.We are dog owners, yet at reception no dog has anything to do. Not everyone likes dogs, or has an allergy. For the employees certainly great if you can bring your dogs to work, but then place them outside the reception.Why is the interior lighting of the lifts in red? Who had probably chosen the fragrance freshener in the lift....Again, location mega, forget the rest. The hotel has real potential, but a lot would have to be done.",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,2
Hotel Cristal Porto,AJohnsonUk,75,AJohnsonUkwrote a review Jul 2024,"Booked two rooms for a four night stay.The first room was an upgraded(€25 per night) larger room with a queen bed, relatively modern and nice bathroom with toiletries.  The second a single room but this had a nice outside balcony.We found the reception staff, in fact all staff very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was a mix of some warm dishes  i.e quiche, bacon, beans and cold offerings  like cheeses, pastries etc, all were regularly replenished and of good quality.The location is slightly out of the hustle and bustle but a 20min walk downhill and a little longer back, the hotel is also on a bus route and taxis were around.   A few good restaurants and shops were close by the area felt pretty safe and quiet.The hotel has a nice outdoor area to just sit out and chill after a long day.We had a late return flight and reception were more than happy to look after our cases once we checked out so we could enjoy the day.Overall for the cost we thought the hotel was excellent,  the nice breakfast and friendly helpful staff added to the experience and we will definitely stay here again.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,4
Solar Dos Cáceres,Curtis-Baileys,52,Curtis-Baileyswrote a review Aug 2022,"A really wonderful little boutique hotel in the middle of a tiny village surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. The hotel is an architect designed restored building with all the mod cons incorporated into the original walls and very interesting and tastefully done.The rooms are clean, modern, attractive, big, and incredibly comfortable. We stayed in one of the superior rooms overlooking the garden and swimming pool. We were made very welcome and both Filipa and Tatiana looked after us very well. The air conditioning worked well, the bathroom was great, more than enough storage, a fridge for us to use and a little area to sit outside in the evening.he restaurant was beautiful and the food delicious. We loved the freshly cooked home made food some of which would compare with many mitchelin restaurants I've eaten in. We were totally catered for even when we needed to get up very early one morning. We also enjoyed playing pool in the bar.Thank you so much for a really lovely week and we hope to visit again one day.",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Rossisto,20,Rossistowrote a review Sep 2019,"I visited this hotel with my partner and 2 young children (1&2).  This is a brilliant hotel!  We arrived about noon and couldn’t couldn’t check straight into our room which we expected but we were provided with our all inclusive bands straight away so we could get some food and drinks, we were also allowed to use a changing room so we could have a dip in the pool to pass some time.The hotel is beautiful, everything is new and the staff work hard to keep things clean and tidy.  The staff are also very friendly, they always took time to chat to my kids, which they enjoyed.I’ve seen some reviews saying that the food is all the same but these people must eat the same kind of food all the time.  I can honestly say i had something different just about every time i visited the restaurant.  The food is good quality and the drinks are decent - Superbock beer and the spirits are branded, Smirnoff Vodka, Gordon’s Gin, i can’t comment on wine or whiskey as i don’t drink them sorry!Our room was a standard double room but it was a good size with 2 big cots already waiting for us.  The fridge is small but keeps your water/milk/beer etc. nice and cold so you can’t complain really.  Plenty of warbrobe space, nice bathroom and the overall decor is lovely.The pool area is fantastic for kids.  3 pools- one for little ones to paddle in, one with slides, and a big one with a swim-up bar and also entertainment for kids and adults.  There are also some big slides for olderkids (and adults).The reception staff are excellent and are happy to help with anything, one member of staff wasn’t up to the standard of the rest but i wouldn’t let 1 person tarnish the good work of the others.  They will also arrange a takeaway picnic for you if you are visiting Zoomarine for the day, it’s nothing special just sandwiches, fruit, cake etc. but it was really appreciated by us.The hotel provides a shuttle bus service that takes you to the old town and beach every day, make sure you’re there early as we missed it one day (our fault).  There is a supermarket about a minute walk down the street and there is a Pharmacy about a 5-10 minute walk away, aswell as plenty of bars, restaurants and shops in close proximity.  Good location!  The hotel also has an onsite shop that sells cigarettes,sweets, toys, sunglasses etc.My only criticisms are that the night time entertainment isn’t close to a bar, the pools were a little cold for my 1 year old daughter, and it was slightly irritating having to show my card every time i entered the restaurant or wanted a drink at the bar.  Certainly nothing to put me off returning in the future though.This is a great hotel, i would fully reccomend it for families as we had a fantastic time.  Thank you to all of the staff that made our stay enjoyable!",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,5
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Connie,3,Conniewrote a review May 2014,"I stayed here for a couple of nights at the beginning of a five week eurotrip but almost considered canceling the rest of my trip and staying there! It was my first stop as a solo traveller and I was a little nervous, but I loved every second here.The basics: great location, nicely decorated, really comfortable beds, huge rooms, very clean. The staff really tries to make it family friendly and make sure it is quiet at night, but it is also ideal for young travelers looking to socialize. Also ridiculously good price - I snagged two nights for 34 euros!However, the experience and the staff is what really made it for me. The hostel activities available are great, definitely go to the hostel dinner every night. I made so many friends this way who made my hostel stay unbelievably great. Also, the food is delicious and homemade right in front of you, it's for a great price, and again, it's such an easy way to meet the other people staying there.In general, the staff there is all wonderful, relaxed but efficient and great at what they do. They take care of you but they also take you in as friends! Joao - who is fabulous - showed me around when I first got there, gave me a great haircut, and came out with us on the pub crawl! Also, I highly recommend the walking tour with Pedro and Quinn. It's informative, and Pedro has plenty of sass to go around! (I've found that the free walking tours are a great way to make friends.) also Miguel was super helpful when I was having trouble checkin out on time. But most of all, I will miss Gilbert! He is your friend instantly! He is so interesting, knows so many languages and loves meeting guests and his job there. He really encourages guests to get the most out of their time there through the great catalog of activities the hostel offers.When I got there, I saw that they have a review framed that says something like, \"came as a friend, left as family.\" I can definitely confirm this. Look no further, come here!! I will be back one day!",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,4

The staff is also good and there is a nice sitting area on the roof. The rooms facing the main street are too noisy. Also, there is no parking places near the hotel, and you have to unload your luggage and try to find a not too far place to park - which makes the situation a bit complicated",Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,3

The Sunday's dinners are nicer than you can imagine, the evening meals during the weeks (especially their Pies) are amazing and well worth a try.

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Darren M,12,Darren Mwrote a review Oct 2014,"The hotel is still undergoing renovations, I had a non refurbished room, but it did not detract from what is an excellent hotel, with superb staff in a great location. My trip was with 9 fellow golfers playing 3 rounds at the wonderful San Lorenzo course and 1 round at Laramjal. If I had been travelling with my wife I may have questioned not having a refurbished room but for 10 guys the rooms were big and comfortable and perfectly adequate.  Local bars and restaurants were excellent and we particularly enjoyed Monty's and the Breeze beach bar after a long day out on the course.  This was our 20th golf trip and all the guys were keen to go back next year, which speaks volumes.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4
PortoBay Serra Golf,ArcticExplorer51,79,ArcticExplorer51wrote a review Sep 2016,"Our first stay at 'Serra Golf' on half board and we were not disappointed. I would have rated \"excellent\" but for the rather unimaginative vegetarian menu offering that was \"pasta heavy\" ! The accommodation is located behind the main 'house' in a purpose built annexe and our room (209) had a comfortable bed, sitting chairs, flat screen TV, en-suite facilities and mini-bar etc. This 'country house' hotel has a small pool at a constant 1.25m depth and a sauna (on demand etc), gym,Spa and residents 'lounge'.Serra Golf is situated at quite a high altitude up in the hills, so we would recommend a hire car to get about. There is a local bus service but I had heard from other guests that it wasn't easy to follow the timetable and the route is definitely \"circuitous\" !On the catering front, the food is generally presented to a high standard - breakfast is the usual Buffet arrangement and for Dinner there was a good general selection. The vegetarian menu (as previously mentioned) was somewhat unimaginative with mainly Pasta dishes offered, as well as the stuffed Aubergine dish that tasted bland.Could I suggest some rice and noodle dishes (stir fry ?), fritata, etc, etc.We would stay again for sure as it is really nice and peaceful there and the staff were friendly and helpful.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

Luna Clube Oceano,Kelly C,27,Kelly Cwrote a review Jul 2016,"Just got back from luna and we absolutely loved it, apartment we took studio ground floor, OK so we didn't get sea views but with a nine yr old having the patio doors opening onto the pool area was perfect,  he woke up and went straight for the pool while we could watch safely from our table while having breakfast, there isn't much entertainment at the apartments but you are so close to old town and new town u didn't need it,  food wise we didn't really eat at lunas restaurants we just ate in apartment and out in the 2 town centres,  we had a few burgers and chips round the pool and the prices were not too bad, staff were friendly and very helpful, the rooms kitchen has a cooker top microwave, kettle,  toaster pots and pans,  plates and all the other utensils you need to cook with, there is an iron and board and hairdryer so don't need to take them,  air con was a definite bonus,  towels were changed every 2 days and room quickly cleaned and mopped,  for us a young family this place was great and we are trying to book for next year already,  if ur looking for a complex with lots of entertainment this isn't for u,  but we didn't care it was full of families and children our son made his own entertainment with the other children, they are very relaxed on rules no major issues with playing music by the pool, saving ur sunbed,  eating ur own food and drink round the pool,  wasn't allowed but nobody really reinforced it they were more interested in you enjoying ur time there,  for families I would definitely recommend,  no stag and hens or all same sex groups which was nice,  if your lucky enough to be going here you will love it",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5

Vila Galé Albacora,mrswWestYorkshire,26,mrswWestYorkshirewrote a review Jul 2007,"we arrived here on the 16th june for 7 days,the hotel is very clean and recently refurbished.We marvelled at the fact we could think of no where else in mid june that we could be sat around  the pool and there be only 16 other people there,even though the hotel was quite full, all the children there were pre school and happy to play in the pool,it does not seem to cater for older kids.There is a free bus into Taveria,if you decide to get a taxi back it  costs around 3 euro,taxis are quite expensive if your journey is outside the local area.The biggest disappointment about the hotel was the food it was cold the water for tea and coffee was cold the staff found it difficult to comprehend that we wanted very hot water,the waiter i asked every day did as i asked,We stayed All inclusive,which stopped at 11pm,The reception staff were very unhelpful and uninterested,we had travelled with XL airways,which had no rep at the hotel and we asked at reception if XL had contacted them regarding our transfer to Faro airport,as our information had been that,reception would be notified regading pick up times, the male receptionist said he had never heard of XL and if he phoned from the hotel we would have to pay for the call.If the food had been anything like,(some days it was terrible),it would be  the perfect place to relax,we will not go again.",Jul,2007,Jul 2007,2007-07-01,2007,2

We love what they've done to the rooms and balcony, and the staff are wonderful.  It really feels like coming home, to be greeted by members of staff who remember you.We expected to do some work from our bedroom and some issues connecting to the internet, and it was sorted easily by Patricia who gave us a router to use in our room.We will definitely be coming back again, next year, if not before.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,5

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Brian A,105,Brian Awrote a review Jul 2017,"Afternoon tea is a must, or so you are told before you travel  to Madeira. So we did it and booked as soon as we arrived, I am not a food critique or a specialist in the art of afternoon tea, but I have been lucky enough to have eaten afternoon tea at some of the better hotels around the world.The service I have to say is very good but for a 5 star hotel it should be, I did think that you would have had your napkin laid on you lap, but sadly not. The Sandwiches at fairly basic and nothing special at all, roast beef with a pot of horse radish wouldHave been nice. But they were all pretty bland, and we were not asked if we wanted brown or white bread it just arrived. The scones where very nice, but. Again a prestigious 5 star hotel should be able to supply clotted cream, jams that are not in small jars, and butter not in a foil container.The small cakes were fine but nothing that wowed your taste buds, the tea and champagne was fine, although the crack in my wife's cup was so big it leaked tea in to the saucer, this was changed straight away but should never have left the kitchen in the first place.I hope you do not take this as a complaint because it is not meant to be, but a 5 star hotel should not rely its past history, this is not a cheap experience.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,TheDove1974,12,TheDove1974wrote a review May 2015,"My wife, 2 daughters and I stayed here for the first time in the 2nd week of may. We were in a self catering apartment that we found well equipped, very spacious and clean. Eveything worked that we needed (didn't try the washing machine or dishwasher) and it was cleaned daily. We never ate in the restaurant here so no idea what it's like, as we always ate out, a snack in the day and then dinner out in the evenings. There are some lovely restaurants within view or a short walk of the hotel or venture further into town which is livelier. We never had a bad meal there - and all very resonably priced. The hotel is in a quieter part of town which was nice to go back to, it is quite a walk for younger kids (ours are 5 & 7) but MGM operate a shuttle bus between their hotels which was really handy for getting to and from the beaches and restaurants. There didn't seem to be too much on entertainment wise or it was on quite late if there was some but we weren't too fussed about that ourselves - they may put more on during busier times too. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was that there is no shallow end in the pool - it's 1.4mtr depth everywhere, which wasn't great for my girls - one of which can swim, the other still learning and neither of whom could touch the bottom of the pool standing. There is a small paddling pool for toddlers but not great for older kids. Fortunately as I mentioned before MGM operate a shuttle bus between their hotels and you can use their facilites freely so we went daily to use another pool which was more fun anyway with slides and diving platforms. Albufeira itself is a nice resort with great beaches and beautiful coastline, not sure we'd like to go in peak season but overall we'd recommend it and the Forte Do Vale. We tend not to go back to the same places but we will look out for other MGM hotels for future holiday destinations.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Samantha A,54,Samantha Awrote a review Oct 2024,"A spotlessly clean larger ground floor apartment (conpliments to the friendly cleaning team)  with a separate bedroom and corner balcony at top of the hill with garden view (K1004) Apartment had everything you might need (Fridge with sml freezer/2 ring hob with extractor/microwave/kettle/toaster and ample pots/pans/ crockery and cutlery) We loved that apartment was serviced regularly with clean towels & bedding. Toilet roll, wash up liquid,  tea towels and soap/shower gel provided was an absolute bonus ðŸ˜ There was a hairdryer and iron provided and the spotless bathroom had the biggest walk in shower with plenty of hot water (Did smell drainy from time to time but to be expected in a facility this big)  Patio table and 2 chairs on balcony and 3 sun loungers which were a little tired but still fully functional. Disco was facing our bedroom doors and bit noisy but bearable,  we didn't use it. TV had couple of English channels if you wanted to pass a bit of time. Grounds were well kept and budgies delightful next to children's play area. Pools looked adequate but not overly inviting (We didn't use it) The hill from reception to our block a bit of a trek but manageable, could be problematic if you had mobility issues though. Main Rd at top of hill fab with small  supermarkets & an Aldi just a 15/20 min walk to the right, A pharmacy, numerous good bars & restaurants etc all to hand and the Strip about 10/15 mins to the left. Tuktuks pricey and land train not beat option if you do t fancy the 45 min walk into Albufeira, I'd book an Uber every time. Ample parking on the hill if you've got a hire car also. Would defo consider coming back again as very peaceful in Oct except the Disco! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,4

I loved it and the location so much that I actually ended up staying on for five months, I have now returned for my second winter stay. The complex has everything to make your stay an all-around comfortable and very enjoyable experience. I travel a lot and have found that few Hotel complexes have so much to offer. Not only are you virtually on the beach there are two swimming pools to choose from and a choice of activities along with live music of a high standard. They offer a choice of rooms to suit your budget which are very nicely decorated and well-equipped for self-catering all rooms include Wifi access and cleaners and of course, there are fairly consistent Blue skies and sunshine.Local shops, bars, and restaurants are also within walking distance with a regular bus or Taxi service into the main Albufeira shopping center or Old town Faro.John apartment 730.Sincere best wishesJohn",Nov,2022,Nov 2022,2022-11-01,2022,4

There wasn't a problem with noise although our room was on the third floor. There was good insulation so we didn't hear any noise from the bar area at all. The selection for breakfast was excellent- so much choice.Tavira itself is lovely. The atmosphere especially at night is wonderful and the food is excellent. Especially recommend, O Patio, Alquasaine and Vela 2. If you want a drink in a really friendly bar, go to Patricks bar (near O Patio).

We lost our appetite after that, my husband went down to the restaurant to check if it was possible to order the toasts, the staffs were very busy and took no notice of him standing at the bar, so we have not eaten at the hotel restaurant since. The staff seems to be polite but not very helpful ranging from reception to the restaurant staff( excepting the breakfast staff  who were very friendly )It started out badly in the first place, the hotel tried to take a prepayment for our booking, for some reason, the transaction did not went through, I got en email informing me that, I called reservation and gave them another card, it was ok, my card was charged , the next day, I got another email informing me that my card was invalid, I called them a couple of times, they did not answer, then I mailed back asking them what the problem was, I was given a tel nr to call, I called and the guy at the other end asked for my name, and said that the booking was ok and it was confirmed, I never got en explanation for that second email.The location of this hotel is good, if u don't mind taking the metro, but for restaurants and night life, I would choose another hotel, .",Dec,2013,Dec 2013,2013-12-01,2013,2

Reservation made; we travel 350km to reach the hotel, after 30 minutes of waiting we are finally welcomed around 7 p.m.It was a very unpleasant surprise when the person at reception informed us that WYD was taking place in Lisbon and that the area in which the hotel is located would be completely closed to all traffic from midnight and those up to 4 days later. late. Total ban on driving by car.Our son needed care and we decided to stay just one night at the hotel.So we had to leave the hotel before being imprisoned there.We paid more than €270 to stay 1 hour in the hotel!This is clearly theft and it is UNALLOWABLE. We should have been warned when we booked because not being from the country we could not have guessed that such an event would make us prisoner in the hotel for 4 days.So we had to hit the road again with our baby and my parents in order to reach someone in our family 150km away.Finally, the receptionist asked us to send an email to management which remained unanswered and a dead letter.

The staff was very friendly and seemed to go out of their way to help. And the restaurant is 5 star for sure.
