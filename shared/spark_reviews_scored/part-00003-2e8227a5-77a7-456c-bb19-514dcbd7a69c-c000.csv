Hotel Madeira,Lesley F,63,Lesley Fwrote a review Jan 2013,"Hotel was noisy, over New Year music plays outside till 4am most nights.  Requested a quiet room on booking but got one right at the front and when we requested a move they were really quite shirty.I found the beds very uncomfortable and the pillows were rock hard.  I would suggest you take your own if you have room.  I would have liked kettle in room, and breakfast, as many have mentioned, was super dull.  Madeira has lovely fresh fruit all year round and a lovely fruit salad wouldn't go amiss.On the plus side it's clean and central and a fair price but overall the cons outweighed the pros for me.",Jan,2013,Jan 2013,2013-01-01,2013,2
Saccharum,MikeGBSL,36,MikeGBSLwrote a review Feb 2016,"Very new hotel (opened April 2015) and everything is finished to a high standard.Staff were great - most were multilingual and very friendly and helpful.Hotel is targeted at adult visitors but have now added a family pool (being completed last week - Feb 2016) to cater for those with younger children. The rooms are very comfortable - others have commented about the smoked glass walls to the shower and WC - which do seem a bit strange at first.We stayed on a half board basis and the food was very good indeed. Breakfast offered fresh fruit, continental, yoghurts, cereals and bacon, eggs, etc. Also scrambled eggs or omelettes are cooked fresh on request. Dinner in the evening had two fish dishes, two meat and a vegetarian option, with vegetables, rices and noodles on different evenings. A very good selection of salads were available every night and a range of desserts and a cheese board were on offer.Two good bars on the 7th and 8th Floors with roof top terraces - well worth a visit (or several)The village is very quiet with a couple of local bars on the main road and three or four bar/restaurants down on the harbour front.There are two man-made beaches - one between the Calheta Beach hotel and the sea another other a little further away.The hotel runs a bus to Funchal and there are also local bus services for the more adventurous.There is a small supermarket near the harbour, with a travel agent who advertises tours of the island and other activities. Well worth a look - we went on a tour and had an excellent day out.",Feb,2016,Feb 2016,2016-02-01,2016,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Oli,0,Oliwrote a review Jun 2025,"Great family stay.Pros - The hotel is generally really clean with very attentive staff. In particular the children’s club/show team who really made an effort with the kids.Buffet food is normally pretty basic in resorts but it was brilliant here. If you can’t find something to eat here, you’re a picky eater.  Fresh pasta made to order, fresh pizza’s, themed nights all week and plenty of choice otherwise. Plus, 2 a la carte restaurants and a snack bar open all day.The pool area was clean and well looked after with a baby pool, kids pool with slides, main pool and 5 big slides for kids and adults.Rooms were clean and tidy and very quiet. We didn’t even hear any noise from other rooms for our whole stay! The best part was the cleaners didn’t do their rounds until 11am minimum so we weren’t getting woken up at the crack of dawn with them wanting to get in. Although we may have just got lucky with the timings…Cons -Checking in took a while (50 minutes) with 4-5 families in front of us which with 2 young kids after an hours transfer, was a bit annoying.Sun-beds. It usually wasn’t an issue getting a sun bed, as long as it was before 9am. If you waited until after, you’ve got no chance! A lot of reserved sun beds too with people not turning up for hours. One set near us had their towels on at 7:30am and didn’t use the beds until 4pm!Kids play area - Possibly a bit tired but fine for kids. However, the base is black rubber tiles and after 36 degree heat could only be described as molten lava! Needs a rethink for young toddlers and kids.There was a soft play for toddlers and babies but only in the kids club opening hours in the same room.  Personally I think there should be something available all day.The main issue by a mile, was the lifts. They simply don’t work. The buttons outside assign you a lift, if you get in the wrong lift god help you as the ones inside the lifts don’t work. Even in the right lift, one day we stopped on every floor from the 9th floor downwards.Queues on a few days were 10-15 minutes long to get prams up. Some opting to carry them up the stairs.If you’re on a middle floor, it’s even worse as they were always full going up and down. EVERYBODY had the same issue with the lifts and it was a massive talking point amongst the whole hotelAs a whole we had a really enjoyable stay and would stay here again in a heart beat. The kids loved it and the whole atmosphere is set up as a family hotel.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,4
Saccharum,Lola R,0,Lola Rwrote a review Jun 2016,"A very chic hotel right by the water. It's set against a mountainous back drop and is modern and clean, but it is in a quiet area. The staff were helpful and polite, the beds were large and comformtbe and the  decor was perfect. It's a shame that the room service closes a little early at 10:30pm, however the hotel restaurant breakfast was great with a lot of options.It takes about 30 minutes by taxi to get to the centre of Funchal by car, and this hotel runs a shuttle in an air conditioned coach. It takes about 45 minutes to the airport. The infinity pool has stunning views of the ocean, and the spa has some great treatments.If you are looking for relaxed, calm, comfortable accommodation then this is the hotel for you. If you want something a little more lively, then I would choose somewhere a little less secluded and nearer to Funchal.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Ellie S,51,Ellie Swrote a review May 2024,"Grand Muthu Forte do Vale is very clean and staff are very attentive and friendly. However, this hotel advertises a lot of amazing amenities and facilities. This may be the case in the peak months but my experience of this hotel in May has been very differentNone of the 14 restaurants they advertise are available and the only dining experience available is their “Flavours Restaurant” - all inclusive, I appreciate isn’t going to be a fine dining experience but the food here is recycled, dry, cold, tasteless. I am not a fussy eater at all but I had found some of the meals to be inedible. Out of 8 meals, the Asian themed night was the only edible food and I have been ill for 3 days since.The pool is a nice area and the hotel is located close to the old town and the strip and just a short walk from a few supermarkets which is really handy. One big downside to this hotel is not having outdoor seating in the evening, the only place to go is their Piccadilly bar which is one dark room indoors.The hotel was really nice if you don’t get food. Although still no where near a 5* as advertised. Not writing to complain to the hotel as seen in other reviews they “do not agree” with their paying customers.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,3

Lisbon Destination Hostel,pikkumyy1984,1,pikkumyy1984wrote a review Jul 2013,"Amazing location, and lovely atmosphere in the hostel. I was staying in a single room, attending an academic conference so I wasn't in Lisbon to party! But all activities were stopped by 11pm and I was never disturbed by noise made by other guests, although there are plenty of things organised for a more sociable crowd. My room was hot, but Lisbon was experiencing an unexpected heatwave of 40°C! I had a fan in my room which I turned on full in order to sleep, which was fine. My room, and the common areas and bathrooms were spotlessly clean, I saw the bathroom being clearned several times during the day when I was there. Staff were very kind and helpful. On the day I checked out, they let me leave my suitcase and hostel towel in storage so I could visit the city, come back in the afternoon and shower, before heading to the airport. For 30 euro a night I consider this very good value.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,John R,74,John Rwrote a review Sep 2016,"First stay at this Hotel, have been coming to Portugal for many years. Best Hotel we have stayed at in Portugal, but not UK 5 star, maybe 4 star. Has been mentioned before, the sofa bed? is the worst I have seen or slept in - ever. MGM towels of a high standard, but some of the other towels not even 2 star. Entertainment very missable, service at Bar bit of a let down, asked to play Pool and was directed to games room. Service everywhere else, especially Reception  excellent. Nice pool, but does need a reurb. Maid service a bit hit or miss. Would stay again, overall very good. Did not eat at hotel, don't think we missed much......",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

Casa Mitchell Apartments,John Carole B,32,John Carole Bwrote a review Feb 2015,We stayed here in September after reading the good reviews. Although the staff were very friendly and attentive the apartments themselves were very tatty and in need of refurbishment the furniture was tired and old . The towels were  in need of replacement and should not have been presented to guests to use . The pool area also was in need of urgent renovation .

PortoBay Liberdade,Denis M,5,Denis Mwrote a review Jun 2015,"Our room was very well equipped with an excellent bed.  The bathroom was very well furnished.  We particularly liked the shower bath. Also the room was cleaned twice a day, which we found very useful as we had showers before going out in the evenings.  It was nice to return later to find that the room had been restored.  The location suited us.  We only did window shopping at the couture houses on the Avenida de Liberdade but the street where the hotel is  was had very little traffic. There was a problem with noise from building work across the road from the hotel.  It is best to ask for a room at the back.  We had a room at the back and we did not have any problem with noise.The staff on reception were cheerful and obliging.  The chairs and tables in front of the hotel were pleasant for an evening drink.  The bar does need to be screened off from the entrance and reception area to ensure more privacy for drinkers.Breakfasts were generally good.  We had dinner one evening at the hotel.  The food was tasty but we thought, a bit overpriced.We think that, with more experience, the staff should be excellent. They have a positive attitude and are doing their best,, but could do with more co-ordination",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,4

Bar and restaurant were not open and staff member said it had not been open since COVID. A massive group of Brits turned up all men with a slap of beer at the pool, load music went on straight away, swearing and being very loud in general, they soon cleared the pool! Group of Dutch lads in apartment above our friends were very noisy and kept flicking cigarette ash on there balcony, they had a fight and one of them had to go to hospital.  Our friends changed rooms which was good.  Location though was perfect and hotel would be lovely with an up grade and no groups should be allowed to book.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,3

It is close to the airport (10 min drive), but a bit far from the city center (20-25 min depending on traffic).The hotel itself is nice and the staff are all very kind and helpful. We stayed in a double room that was roomy and clean. The only complaint about our room was that the air conditioning unit was very loud when turned on, and our toilet button did get stuck for a while, but we fixed it.The hotel restaurant, Tapas and Tiles was very yummy. I’d definitely recommend it if you’re looking for some drinks and small bites.This hotel is fine to stay at for a night or two if you need to be close to the airport.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,4

The staff are very friendly and helpful especially Joe the doorman. He is a veritable mine  of information for everything!Our room was sea facing and very well appointed. It is worth paying a little extra for this. The open shower was not a problem for us, but I understand how  this might not suit everyone. The beds were very comfortable and luxurious to sleep in. We had a balcony with a view of the beach bar and the swimming area. The air conditioning was very efficient and quiet.We booked bed and breakfast but did purchase one of the meal packages so we ate in the hotel for  some meals. The rest of the time we ate at the local Italian restaurant which we loved! The choice for breakfast was plentiful with eggs cooked to order to your liking as well as pancakes. There was an abundance of fruit and meats and breads to choose from as well.The infinity pool was great to relax in and to swim in leisurely. There were plenty of sun beds with parasols for everyone . We liked the upper deck under the banana tree!We also enjoyed the nightly live music in the cocktail bar where you could watch the sunset whilst listening to music and sipping on a cocktail.This was a very relaxing holiday in a lovely hotel in a smaller and quieter part of the island. The hotel did run buses at a charge into Funchal and to local areas of interest.If you want some luxury whilst relaxing then I would recommend this hotel to you.",Feb,2018,Feb 2018,2018-02-01,2018,4

Palacete Real Companhia do Cacau,Maria Goncalves,152,Maria Goncalveswrote a review Oct 2016,"The building, seen from the outside, made me think of a strict interior, without soul or human heat.  But when the owner opens the door and smiles, you understand that you will find a place where you will feel like home, a magical place, full of treats that you only expect to find among family or friends. And this feeling is reinforced when you are offered a free snack, consisting of delicious and homemade scones, jam, cheese, tapas and a spetecular and chilled white wine from the region. What a reception!Onother great surprise was the suite upgrade. We booked a certain suite (that was very nice and cosy) but we were offered an other suite, much bigger and better located (near the swimming pool).An experience that we will repeat.Outstanding decoration and restauration!",Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,5

Wow, what a different experience we had as a family...As a family of 3, we booked a 'Family Room'. At the time of booking we also had to specify our Sons age which you would then assume would be taken into consideration when allocating your room... No such luck.Before being shown to our room, the Receptionist advised that they had not added a bed to the room for my five year old and we should see whether the sofa would suffice. Not ideal I thought, but open minded, again assumed it would be a sofa bed atleast. Wrong...My first 'note' was that were on the 11th floor. That in esscence didn't bother me, but thought it odd that family rooms were at the top of the hotel. Upon entering the room, it was laid out over two floors, ie - living/dining area downstarirs, bedroom upstairs. The sofa, was indeed just that - a leatherette sofa. No additional bedding, pillows etc.So, their expectation was that we would let our Son sleep downstairs, on a sofa in the livingroom on the 11TH FLOOR with a patio door that isn't lockable?! Absolutely no way! Also, less importantly, if my Son were to go to 'bed' before us, effectively that would mean that we wouldn't have use of the Living/Dining area in order to let him sleep.We called Receptionist and explained that we needed a bed. In the meantime, we also noticed that there was no bath - showers only, again not ideal for a 'family room' with small children. In addition, there were no tea/coffee facilities, which we were later advised only come as standard in a Superior Room (which we had)/?!The bed arrived some time later by two nice Ladies who attempted to errect it in the Living area!? We expalined absolutely not and they weren.t sure what to do - they couldn't get the bed up the stairs. They then asked for help to get the bed upstairs and after a short time, they managed to get the bed up there - although it did make for an extremely tight squeeze.We spoke to the Front of House the next day who were totally disinterested in our complaint... Weknew we were wasting our time!Later that day, we went to the Kids Pool/Play Area. My Son had made friends with another little boy and I had got chatting to the little boys Mum who was 7 months pregnant. When she walked over to the side of the kids pool to call her little boy over, the 'edging' of the pool collapsed from under her!!! She had huge swelling/bruising to  her leg, but just kept saying how thankful she was that it was her and not one of the kids!It took 2 days for the pool to be repaired and moreso, the Management Team did very little in the way of making sure that she was ok - even advising that they don't have an 'accident book', and therefore couldn't log the accident. One of the Maintenance team said that the pools were checked a few MONTHS beforehand and were only checked sporadically!Overall, extremely disappointed and wouldn't go back again.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,2
Hotel Convento de Sao Paulo,PAMPB,124,PAMPBwrote a review Aug 2023,"Contrary to the saying that we shouldn't return to the places where we were happy, we returned to this magical place for the 4th or 5th time!The monumental building continues to be rehabilitated slowly but with great taste. The comfort of the room where we stayed (131), although not super-luxury, was very pleasant, spacious and comfortable. All that remains is to remove the “rain” from the television…:-) and, for safety for the elderly, a support to get in and out of the bathtub.Breakfast is very good, with good variety and quality.The restaurant was a beautiful surprise - it will be evaluated in “restaurants - O ermita”.Less good was the service at the pool bar, not because of the quality of the service, but because of the delay and disorganization, I believe due to the inexperience of the “novices”, despite the unstoppable effort of the responsible “friar” João!In addition to the physical beauty of this place, we must praise the excellent spirit, efficiency and friendliness of the entire hotel team, who “sing” almost in unison in Alentejo! How great it is to be welcomed in Serra da Ossa by young and dynamic local people! A big thank you Maria, Rita, João and Fàbio - they were the ones I dealt with the most.This stay was the exception that confirms the rule: we were very happy and… we will be back!",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4
Noah Surf House,bilbao40,22,bilbao40wrote a review Oct 2023,"When Noahsurfhouse opened, I was a real fan of everything Noah. The hotel, the concept, the aesthetics, the food, the service.... so much so that I have sent many friends to this hotel. I myself tried to return in 2020 but due to the pandemic I couldn't, I had to cancel my reservation and went to Areias do Seixo.I made many people go, there was even a meeting of senior European managers thanks to my recommendation in areas of the sixties.This year I returned to the hotel, I booked about six nights. The change was impressive.Upon arrival they gave you a surf poncho and a bottle to refill water. The bottles were already gnawed and it was not very attractive to drink from.The concept of the hotel has changed, they exploit the rooftop for people from outside the hotel and it is filled with people who use the services that were set up for hotel guests. A rooftop with many people in attendance for which a door-to-door toilet is available with a room that charges 400 euros per night. The noise and the smell......The kindness of people like Pedro (a waiter who was at the beginning and who later was at Areias do seixo) has disappeared. Not sincerely friendly people.....I could go on with many things that disappointed me but the worst was a dinner in which they had 1 hour and 40 minutes to serve us something. We saw that people were coming from abroad and they were served before..... at first we took it patiently, cool, relaxed..... but it was unacceptable that when we told the person in charge... the only thing he said\"The times have not been optimal\" like...... when what he had to do was apologize and have attention. They received no attention at all.We decided to leave the hotel earlier than planned, paying for the entire stay. Friends of mine had booked for September and obviously I told them about my experience.I wrote an email explaining the same thing I just told.....and,,,,In short, \"It's not what it used to be\" was wonderful before, now absolutely disappointing. A shame.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,2
Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,PimDutch,50,PimDutchwrote a review Oct 2022,"Great value for money hotel, with nice, spacious and clean rooms and large twin beds. Daily maid service. Can recommend to pay a little extra for sea view rooms! We loved the sounds of the sea and crickets at night (we slept with the door open).We stayed here in October and it was really quiet during the day at the pool and at night as well. In the morning breakfast was a little crowded but with lots of options. Also loved the pools and wellness (sauna and Turkish bath free of charge).Tip: hike along the seaside from the hotel, absolutely stunning views there!",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,5

Hotel Gat Rossio,Courtney D,65,Courtney Dwrote a review Mar 2016,My husband and I stayed at Hotel Gat Rossio this past March for 2 nights. We booked here after staying at their sister hotel in Berlin (Hotel Gat Point Charlie).  This hotel has a great location - nearly directly beside Rossio train station and is close to everything you want to see in Lisbon! Especially Fabrica Da Nata where you can get delicious and warm Pasteis Da Nata!We really enjoyed staying here - the room was very modern and mostly comfortable. My only complaint would be the sheets (which weren't very soft - a bit scratchy) and the mattress (quite firm). Other than that everything was great. The included continental breakfast could be improved upon - but in general was pretty good.I would definitely stay here again though.,Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,4
Hotel Albergaria Dias,Sue D,8,Sue Dwrote a review Dec 2014,"We loved this hotel, it lives up to previous reviews, I was worried my husband would find walking difficult as its a very hilly island but he managed fine, going out of the back gate of the hotel is a slight incline but you are seconds away from lots of really good restaurants. We hired a taxi recommended by Mr Dias to tour the island, we found this a cheaper option, the driver was a very knowledgeable and pleasant man. We got the bus to the  shopping malls and enjoyed some retail therapy.",Dec,2014,Dec 2014,2014-12-01,2014,5
Eurostars Porto Douro,NSpivak,26,NSpivakwrote a review May 2018,"We recently returned from a week long trip to Porto. Upon arrival we were thrilled to receive a complimentary upgrade from a standard room to a junior suite. What a fantastic room! Spacious, bright, clean, and with a little terrace with a fantastic view!  Thank you!The hotel is well located by the river within easy walking distance of the Ribeira area and also Gaia where all of the Port Cellars reside. Just down the street is a funicular that makes getting up to the downtown area a lot easier.The breakfast is good with a decent variety of foods, but the same foods every day. By the end of the week, we knew it by heart and we're ready for some change.The photo I posted is from our room. We really enjoyed the view.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,5

Ocean Gardens,Metalactual,59,Metalactualwrote a review Dec 2011,"The hotel is located outside of Funchal which means a travel each day. Is easy accessed via bus No.39 Bus ( yellow ) in 15 mins., cost less than 1,50 eur with card. The buses are an amazing experience, up & down also, especially going into the mountains. You can reach the hotel from airport or return to airport using the green bus SAM, I forget the number, cost less than 4 eur/one way/p.p. The Aerobus doesn't reach the hotel, it run on the highway. The hotel is quiet and It is on a cliff with breathtaking views across Funchal Bay.Pros:The room was clean ( daily maid service ), very comfortable ( king size bed ) and quiet.Nice balcony with table and two chairs and beautiful view.Nice and very quiet small pool, on the rooftop, with a beatiful garden well kept.Stunning views over the Funchal city from the rooftop, in the evenings/nights.Nice and helpful personal at the reception desk.Free computer in the lobby, reception desk.Free parking places.Cons:The breakfast could have offered more variety. The staff does not refill the empty plates, if you come later in the morning. Not an 4* breakfest, definitly.Still, in two morning days I requested an early breakfest for us, with half an hour in advance, and they prepared for us 75% from the regular breakfest, nice touch !I recommend this hotel, but...is better to rent a car.Stayed on July 2011.",Dec,2011,Dec 2011,2011-12-01,2011,4

Our room (which was large and comfy) was directly over the bar and entertainment area on the 2nd floor and sleeping was very difficult at times. The rooms also have tiled floors which means you can hear every movement on the floor above, also we felt that we were in the shower with our next door neighbours as the soundproofing was that bad.This ruined an otherwise excellent hotel, the breakfasts were great, the location was great, the staff were efficient, but because of all the noise (also banging doors) we would not return.",Mar,2008,Mar 2008,2008-03-01,2008,2

Casa Vela Boutique House,Deborah J,4,Deborah Jwrote a review Jun 2012,"From the moment we arrived at the Casa Vela guest house we felt very welcome. Our outward bound flight was delayed by 4 hours and we arrived in Cascais at 1.30am. We had telephoned the hotel from the airport about our unexpected late arrival and were so glad that it was no problem. Just a word of warning, our taxi from the airport cost 60 Euros and according to the hotel staff some guests have paid up to 100 Euros in the past! It is much much cheaper to get the Aero Bus and then the train from Lisbon.The buffet breakfast was great. The selection of food laid out was excellent, we loved the custard tarts! Even towards the end of the breakfast period the food was freshly replenished.The guest house is split into two parts, the old house and a minimalist modern extension. The design of the rooms was stunning and spacious. We stayed in the Curry suite (all the rooms are themed) I loved the modern design. The only slightly unusual thing was there was no proper separation between the bedroom and the bathroom. I was sharing with a really close friend, other people might find this uncomfortable. Our room had facilities to prepare meals and a fridge to cool drinks which was very useful.Our room was not overlooked by any other room in the guest house and the gardens leading down to the pool were beautiful. The quickest route from our room to the pool was down a path from our terrace which was also a water feature. Some guests might be scared of falling on the wet path, but it is not far to walk through the building to the pool. The setting of the pool itself is like an oasis. We loved the rocking sun loungers, we want to buy some for ourselves!Location-wise it is situated just outside of the centre of Cascais which makes for a quiet, relaxing environment around the guest house gardens.Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this guest house to people wanting to escape for a relaxing chilled out holiday. I would certainly stay here again.",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,4

It's a small hotel but that's what we loved about it. Highly recommend the Suite (there are only 2, you get your own plunge pool). The hikes on the property are great, the wine tasting and dinners on property are awesome, and the hiking/kayaking/etc offered are also a lot of fun.This hotel is truly a hidden gem!!!",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,5

The metro is on the door step and you can be in the centre of town in about 10mins or if you prefer, it is a pleasant walk down the Ave Liberdade to town soaking in the atmosphere.Also the hotel overlooks the park and the main terminal turnaround for the open top bus tours.Overall, ideal if you wish to be close to the centre but not in the noise and hussle.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,4

This was our first trip to Portugal and we could not fault the accommodation offered at the Bellevue Apartments. Some of the best we have ever experienced! We stayed in No. 12 as a couple and enjoyed the privacy of our patio area with sunbeds. Unfortunately the weather didn't allow us too much time in the sun but we enjoyed everything that Carveiro had to offer. The apartment was spacious, spotless, well equipped and comfortable.  The TV had 2 English channels, towels were changed three times in a week, the kitchen had every kind of equipment, there was plenty of storage space -  the list goes on and on, just too many features to mention! There was a wonderful restaurant just across the road - A Rede and a small supermarket for everyday needs. Within a short distance the town offered everything for the holidaymaker as well as spectacular nearby beaches.

Vila Galé Coimbra,Luiz Felipe N,22,Luiz Felipe Nwrote a review Feb 2011,"I'm 43 and I usually traveling for leisure, but in the case of Vila Gale Hotel in Coimbra the purpose of my trip is diferent: i´m attending a post graduation course in Coimbra University.I stayed in the hotel twice, each time for one night, in a standart twin room, and paid 68 euros per night (VAT included, single occupancy).The hotel is brand new. Both the common areas and the rooms are spacious and have all the comforts one could expect in a hotel of this type. The breakfast is excellent and is served in a spacious room bathed in natural light.There are some minor problems of construction because the material used in the building is not top quality. During my first stay, for example I noticed the tap of the bidet and the magnifying mirror were not perfectly fixed (a little bit loose). But this kind of detail will not compromise your experience.A real problem can be the bed because the mattress is hard. There are people who like this type of mattress, but I'm used to very soft mattresses. It is a matter of preference.I've stayed in Coimbra before, for another 5 times, in a hotel that is right beside Vila Galé, the \"Hotel Dona Inês\". It is also an excellent hotel, but if are alone alone, the rate for individual occupancy of Gale, only 3 euros more expensive, is a better deal because the Vila Gale has (1) 24 hours room service and (2) the breakfast is much better.",Feb,2011,Feb 2011,2011-02-01,2011,3
Pousada Viseu,Biscas,52,Biscaswrote a review Sep 2020,"It has been many years since I last visited Viseu and it is nice to see that the city has evolved a lot and in what seems to be in good ways. I wanted to stroll around the historical part of the city without worrying about driving around so I decided to stay here since it is a 5-minute walk to the old part of town. Lots of free parking available within the grounds and that was one of my first conditions. However, that was just the beginning of our great short stay! why do I say this, well... greeted with a smile by their very professional reception staff that explained everything about the hotel and its rules during this Covid period (Kudos to Fábio and his colleague). I also have to mention that the restaurant/breakfast staff were also top-notch! As for the hotel itself, the rooms are basic, VERY spacious, comfortable with amenities and very clean (this latter one is also a must for me). Breakfast is not buffet but served, due to the pandemic, and is of good quality. There is an attractive central atrium as well as a sitting/reading room to get some work done and outside there is not much but there is a nice pool and sunbeds to relax a bit (it can get very hot there during the morning period but you can always find some shaded areas). Did not get a chance to try the Spa nor the fitness room so I won't be able to comment on those. Now, I've stayed in several Pousadas in Portugal and Paradors in Spain and even though this one does not have the history that other ones have, it was actually one of the ones I enjoyed the most. I certainly recommend it and will be visiting again.",Sep,2020,Sep 2020,2020-09-01,2020,4
