Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Angela D,5,Angela Dwrote a review Jul 2023,"Incredibly spacious rooms!!  We had the one with the rooftop terrace, which also had several other terraces! Having a kitchen and washing machine in the unit was super-helpful. Pools were great. Right on beach. Couple of restaurant options in walking distance. Fantastic breakfast buffet at the hotel. TIP: the blinds to block sun are on the outside of the windows. We didn't realize that until a couple of days into the trip, so woke up with the sun a couple of mornings. Hotel is very close to Lagos. Would highly recommend!!  Would go back if I'm ever in the area again.",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,5

Also is right across from Habana which has some great solo live music at night so you can sit on the balcony with a sea view, watching the people and listening to music with a glass of wine.  The rooms themselves are comfortable with a nice ocean breeze.  They have a private pool and a private little \"bar\" where you can get breakfast, lunch, or a snack or a drink by the pool if you like.

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Anemone,16,Anemonewrote a review Apr 2017,"We ended up here by chance and could have not been happier! Everything in this hotel is just right: the service, the interior design, breakfast + the bar and the restaurant, the rooms, the building itself is incredibly beautiful and the location is excellent - funny how Lonely Planet Portugal didn't mention anything about this area even when it's full of interesting shops & restaurants, and on Sunday there was a wonderful flea market right on the square next to the hotel + metro stop (Intendente) is close by though it's only a short walk to the centre.But the service was best of all, everyone was so nice and ready to help with all our arrangements and questions. PLUS when you check in you don't have to hang around at the desk when tired from the journey etc. but instead they offer you to sit down, have a nice drink (excellent home made ice tea...!) and have the check in done with no stress. Absolutely wonderful! Definately worth it. This went to our top 5 list of best hotels ever <3",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,5

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,empathology,255,empathologywrote a review Jan 2009,"This is an excellent 'design' hotel perched high above the sea affording spectacular views where ever you look.Positives (too many!) - Great location, you're away from the hustle and bustl;e of Funchal but it's close enough to get to easily (45 minutes). Lots of little places to sit and soak up the atmosphere. Good size clean rooms with superb views. Excellent evening restaurant (food, service). No kids (almost!) - this is a modern quiet hotel.Negatives - You're largely left to fend for yourself - which is great - but I wish someone had told us of the 100+ tourist guides lying in the lounge! Breakfast is a bit of a scrap - too many guests and not enough tables.Madeira is a superb location for beauty and tranquility. This hotel serves that purpose 100%",Jan,2009,Jan 2009,2009-01-01,2009,4

Dom Carlos Liberty,Vegaslawbabe2,2,Vegaslawbabe2wrote a review Jun 2023,"This is a review of the Dom Carlos Liberty Hotel.I wil get to the point. The positives: The room is clean.The breakfast is adequate.The elevator is decently fast.Location is conveniently located near the Avenida de Libradade, so you have many options for restaurants and bars.AC is great especially on a hot dayMini FridgeNow for the negatives you want to hear:This hotel is in great need of an update.The room is extremely small-it’s so small we don’t even have enough room to open our 2 carry-on. This room is pricier than some other hotels in the area so I think it’s not worth what we paid.The bathroom is extremely small. Yes, I understand this is “standard” in Europe.  However if safety is concern, ie big enough room so that you can step in safely inside the tub, without slipping and cutting yourself in the swinging glass tub door, then you won’t find it here.The service just plainly sucks. We came from another hotel down the street where the staff made sure they go above and beyond.  Here, you have a bell person (not sure exactly what he is), that is constantly “hovering”, and pacing back and forth and have no respect for space.They have literally zero toiletries. They have a shampoo/body gel combined which aren’t filled in a regular so hopefully you’d bring your own (and enough if your hubby will use some too).They have zero info on how to reach the front desk in the room.  So we have no idea how to contact the front desk from the room. There’s a phone but not sure how to dial out.Staff.  Coming from a hospitality industry, I know a thing or two about the importance of providing good customer service. This place has zero clue. The entire staff needs some serious training on how a hotel should operate. Most of the front facing people are rude and  mostly unfriendly. Don’t use the language barrier card either.  Staff that don’t speak your language will still attempt to communicate, have the facial expressions and body language to  genuinely show they care. The hovering bell person/manager (maybe, like I said not sure) made us uncomfortable the whole time we were there. I certainly will not come back here ever, and don’t recommend at all! Stay somewhere else.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,2
SANA Capitol Hotel,CasaSulo,143,CasaSulowrote a review Jan 2018,"The hotel was a little difficult to locate and, parking was OK in the underground car park but we had to double park, go into reception to be told where it was. Having said that the receptionist was helpful spoke several languages, and answered all questions.Our room, 604 was, a reasonable size with space to walk around, twin beds, fitted wardrobe space and cupboards – enough for a week or more storage. The large worktop area was useful for the lap-top and would be good as an office desk. There was also a coffee capsule machine with coffee, a nice touch but no creams or sugar! There was also an ice machine on level -1 which was useful and well used. The, limited non Portuguese TV gave a reasonable choice and the free WIFI had good connectivity and fast. Beware of opening the windows though it automatically cuts off the air-con.The bathroom was “green” not our choice but well kitted out with mirrors, plugs, hair dryer etc. and the shower was refreshing, plenty of towels and a good size – for once. A word of warning though beware of the door stop which is placed just in front of the loo guaranteeing a painful toe in the night!Breakfast was buffet style, everything was, just about good. Nothing leapt out and said, “We’re special”. Once again, like the TV limited selection of hot foods and cereals. The bread board and cakes were really good but we found the coffee too bitter so we took our own brand down we would definitely have been bored with the selection after three days.Overall, the place looks tired and in need of a face over – for the price we paid and add the €15.20 car park fee and the €1pp per night Lisbon tax- and the carpet in our room urgently requiring a clean or replacement it proved expensive but the saving grace is the staff. All, without exception were polite, good humoured and knowledgeable.The acid question would we stay here again? Probably not even though it is reasonably central",Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,3

Arriving at the hotel directly from the airport, it was apparent I made a good choice in lodging.  The front desk attendant Anastasia provided one of the best check in experiences I have encountered. From the sincere welcome to providing great suggestions, it was apparent that she was proud of the city, justifiably so.  The room and property are very well maintained and the staff is outstanding.  I am looking forward to returning to this hotel in the near future.",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,4
Four Seasons Fairways,Glenn T,42,Glenn Twrote a review Aug 2015,We stayed at FSF from 23-30 July 2015 as a party of 7 in a 3 bed villa with pool. Since we first holidayed there over 20 years ago (last occasion 4 years ago) we never fail to be impressed by the quality and presentation of the resort and the individual accommodation. Staff were speedy in their responses and warm in their welcome. A great place for a vacation with lots to do in and around the resort complex. We were blessed also with excellent weather - here's hoping for a return visit soon. FSF provides excellent value for money.,Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,5

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",slj60,636,slj60wrote a review Oct 2023,"Reids is a lovely hotel where we have experienced two holidays to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Last year’s stay was pretty faultless, this years, less so.The grounds are kept immaculately by the gardeners, the cleaners keep the hotel pristine, the flower displays are stunning and the waiting staff are attentive and charming. The hotel has 128 rooms, so for a hotel of this size,  the personal touch should be easily achievable, but it was missing this last stay.Our first visit to Reids was last year, I booked  superior suite 450.  On first appearances it was lovely.  The General Manager left a card welcoming us with a bottle of wine,  but  the waters ran brown out of every tap.  I called reception and was told  “that suite isn’t used that often, we’ll send maintenance up”. I was quite horrified, was the hotel not aware of how to prevent legionnaires disease by running taps frequently? A man came up but after 30 minutes the water was still brown. While he was there I had noticed that the  suite was in need of a major refurbishment. The carpets were threadbare in places, the soft furnishings were tatty, the air conditioning didn’t work, the fridge was dirty and needed defrosting and the water was still brown.  I called reception and asked to see the manager.We were moved to suite 770, the George Bernard Shaw Suite.The rest of our week’s stay at Reids was quite lovely.   On our wedding anniversary flowers and a bottle of champagne were brought to our room  with a personal note from Ciriaco Campus the General Manager and before we left another note arrived from Patricia Gomez, PA to the General Manager, thanking us for choosing to stay at Reids with a bottle of Madeira wine.When we checked out we booked to return this year and reserved the Winston Churchill Suite which is considered to be the best suite in the hotel, for the week of our wedding anniversary.   We  left generous gratuities for the staff we hadn’t met or been able to thank personally because they are equally responsible for guest experience as the front facing staff are.I sent several emails to various members of the management team personally thanking them for making our stay so special and said we looked forward to returning to Reids .So let’s move onto this stay and why it was disappointing ……I contacted the hotel on the 1st September ( our stay started on the 16th October) to book restaurants. I asked if the Flavours of Madeira dinner would be held in the dining room on the 17th October and said I hoped it was because it was such a wonderful room to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I booked to eat in the hotel’s restaurants for four nights out of our seven night stay.In all communication with the hotel I referred to us as “we” or “ my husband and I”A few days before we travelled, I received an email from the hotel asking us to check in online giving our passport details.  I sent them my details and those of my husband, so they knew a married couple were staying with them.We arrived on the 16th October.  A girl on Reception asked who we were. I told her and she proceeded to speak only to me, “Welcome Mrs ….” Oblivious to the fact my husband was standing next to me. She didn’t appear to know what room we were in (the staff should be aware of returning guests, especially when staying in their best suite) and then asked us if this was our first visit to Reids.We were shown to the Suite, which is gorgeous, it was lovely to be back. There were two envelopes in the room, both addressed only me, not to my husband and I.My husband joked“Am I invisible or don’t I exist anymore.?”.One note readWelcome to the Legendary Reids Palace! We wish you a delightful stay, Best regards Patricia Duarte Executive Assistant ManagerMs Duarte was obviously unaware we were returning guests as the note should have read “Welcome back….. ”.The other envelope contained details of the restaurant bookings I had requested to be made but two nights’  reservations were missing.Other aspects of the rest of our stay were disappointing .The Winston Churchill Suite.The Winston Churchill Suite is the hotel’s best suite.  It is their most expensive suite and almost certainly the most expensive suite on the Island of Madeira. Therefore you would expect it to be exceptional. It was kept clean and generally well serviced, but the small things that cost the hotel virtually no money were lacking;On arrival were four traditional Madeira pastries and a small bowl of fruit, every room gets these.    The fruit should be replaced every other day as is done in other hotels we have stayed in. By day four the fruit was starting to rot and fruit flies were appearing  so I removed it from the suite and left it outside the front door. It was never replaced.   In other hotels we have stayed in fresh milk is provided each morning. I kept having to ask for this every day as the only ‘milk’ was two tiny pots of horrible creamer. I asked for fresh milk in the room last year too. This should have been recorded on a  guest preference  card for future reference but I can only assume the hotel does not keep guest preference cards, these help the hotel to determine, dietary requirements, pillow preferences, etc.There were only four teabags provided each day, two English breakfast and two fruit tea. One morning the mini bar staff arrived so I asked for some Earl Grey, it never arrived until I saw the mini bar man three days later and asked again. The suite has a small kitchen, why not leave a  supply of different teas and a small selection of fresh pastries each day for guests?The Teapots were never washed up and the  large terrace was not tidied. I don’t think the towels on the sunbeds of the terrace were changed all week.  After a torrential storm the floor of the terrace was swept but was left dirty and needed cleaning.  The towels were changed only because they had got wet after the storm and that was on our penultimate day.Dirty water from the tapsAs mentioned above, last year we encountered a serious issue with the water in Suite 450.  This year after we had walked to and from Camara de Lobos, about 9 miles in total, I wanted a shower, hair wash and then to soak in the bath. I ran the bath taps and once again filthy water came out the taps, even after running them for several minutes. We were told this is nothing to worry about, the hotel has ‘old pipes’ and they need to clear sometimes.  This is clearly an issue throughout the hotel as 450 is in the new wing and 670 in the old.  Guests should be made aware of this, as it is alarming to see filthy water spilling from a tap.  Other reviewers have highlighted this too so it’s not been fixed in years.On the first morning of our stay  (our wedding anniversary)we went to breakfast  and were shown to our table by Andrea.  Again we were asked for our names and she couldn’t find who were were on the list. I couldn’t remember the room number and said we were in the Winston Churchill Suite and she looked a me blankly and said she didn’t know what room that was.Shortly after we sat down I noticed a lady wandering round talking to guests, she didn’t look like management.   She came over and introduced herself as Patricia, Executive Assistant Manager. She told us she used to do PR at the hotel but had been promoted and was standing in for the General Manager who was on three weeks leave after having a knee replaced. Eventually, after telling us all about herself, she asked us who we were, what room we were in , my husband told her, and then asked if this was our first stay at Reids.I was surprised by this question. For the last six years, I have been on the management committee of a large iconic hotel, recently voted one of the World’s 50 Best Hotels.   I know from experience, that these 5 star super deluxe hotels, of which Reids considers itself to be one of, hold regular departmental meetings  where staff are briefed who is arriving at the hotel, how long they are staying for and if known, what room or suite they will be in,  as well as any other relevant information such as birthdays, anniversaries, honeymoons etc.  This is so staff can greet guests by name, wish them whatever they are celebrating, and make them feel appreciated and valued guests.Therefore for the acting General Manager to be completely oblivious to who we were was quite incredible.  She said our suite was even more lovely than Suite 770. I agreed with her and mentioned we had stayed in Suite 770 last year after we had to move from Suite 450 which needed refurbishing. To my surprise she replied “ yes we do need to refurbish that suite”, so despite a whole year passing, it hadn’t been done.Around 2.30 that afternoon we decided to have a light lunch in the restaurant by the pool. Andrea showed us to our table, and we ordered a bottle of wine. It took 15 minutes, despite the restaurant not being busy, for someone to come and take our order. After 30 minutes the wine still had not arrived .  Andrea walked around the restaurant smiling vacantly at the odd person and despite trying to attract her attention on three occasions she seemed oblivious to this.  Our food eventually arrived but still no wine.I then beckoned Pedro the manager over. Pedro is a consummate host and really values his guests. I told him to cancel the wine and said we were disappointed to see the two ladies at the next table to us, who had sat down 15 minutes after us, had their wine brought immediately and we were still waiting for ours. I said to Pedro, we rarely drink at lunchtime, but today is our wedding anniversary and we wanted to celebrate with some lovely wine but the moment had now passed.    Pedro insisted we have the wine and brought a bottle straight away. After lunch he said there would be no charge for due to the breakdown in service.  He also sent us over two glasses of Moet champagne at dinner that night with his compliments.We really appreciated this and Pedro is an exceptional member of the Reids team.After being made to feel so special last year we were surprised that when we returned to the suite later that day that there was nothing from senior management wishing us a Happy Anniversary,  not even a card.On our last day late afternoon I received a call from Reception ‘inviting me to stay another week in the suite’. I wasn’t sure if the gentleman was being serious or what exactly he meant by this, but said we get home. He then told me the car would take us at the airport at 11.15 the next morning. The hotel had full details of our flights because I had asked them to book transfers as these were not included in the rate of the suite, which is unusual for a 5 star hotel.   Our flight was at 11.40am. Isa Sousa head concierge, had confirmed a  09.15 pick up to me in an email on the 1st September, so again nobody had read the correspondence.After this phone call, my husband and I started looking at The Suites at The Cliff Bay to stay at when we return to Madeira.A bottle of Madeira wine, which we appreciated, was sent up to the suite on the last night, with a card again addressed only to me, not to both of us, which I consider rude in the extreme.This review is not about not getting a freebie for our anniversary, but the complete lack of recognition and attention to detail from a hotel that should pride itself on customer experience. When you get to this level of cost and luxury, the difference is in the attention to detail and personal touches that make guests feel special. A suite that is charged at the rate of the Winston Churchill Suite should be exceptional and the servicing of it exemplary. It wasn’t.What is very good …..The Breakfast/Pool restaurant.Breakfast at Reids is feast. Special mention must go to Lucia who welcomed us on our second and subsequent mornings with her lovely smile and “Welcome back, how lovely to see you both again”.  She is a charming lady and does her job exceptionally well.Elizabeth is a real asset to Reids, she remembered and welcomed us back and the level of service she provides is impeccable.Andre is a new member but it was delightful to be served by him and he was very attentive.The breakfast choice is excellent and the service is generally very good apart from one day when  I ordered porridge which never arrived.Villa Cipriani is a lovely restaurant and the food very good.  Vania is superb waitress, she is attentive, charming, incredibly helpful when explaining dishes and so professional.Victor FeldtVictor is an outstanding member of the front of house team.  We first met him last year when we had the issues with Suite 450.  On day 5 of our stay this year our boat trip had been cancelled due to bad weather out at sea and I met Victor going back to our suite. He remembered us from last year and stopped to talk to us. I told him, I told him about not seeing the Dolphins and Whales and he sat us down and spent several minutes talking to us suggesting what else we could do that day. We decided to walk to Camara de Lobos  and Victor gave us a map and recommended which route to take and restaurants and bars to visit.Victor reminds me very much of Thomas Kochs, one of the World’s greatest hoteliers. We  wish Victor continued success and feel confident he will rise to great heights in hospitality.I know this is a long review and I am sad to feel the need to post it but, our stay was not booked through a tour company, nor through a travel agent and not through a third party website and not even through Belmond. It was booked twelve months in advance, directly with Reids.The hotel knew we were returning guests and had chosen to return to celebrate our wedding anniversary because we were made to feel very special when we stayed last year.A good hotel, regardless of cost or number of stars it holds, should strive to exceed their guests’ expectations. Last year Reids did just that, but this year they failed to deliver due to a lack of communication at senior levels.In 2022 Reids set themselves a very high bar.This year the bar fell into the ocean.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,4

Wyndham Residences Alvor Beach,André A,99,André Awrote a review Sep 2023,"The plus:The location, very close to the beach (3min walking) and from city center (10min walking).The room is very spacious with a nice balcony, kitchen well equiped and confy bed.  The staff is super friendly, always ready to help quering if everything was ok.  Pool area is nice with a lot of sunbeds and bar service and free towels (you can take it to the beach too). All common areas looks freshly renovated.The minus:The bathroom has a draining problem, the floor gets flooded very easily so the use of towels on the floor is needed (environmental issue). The sun umbrellas need an update because it can't be properly fixed and the wind makes them fly, can be a bit dangerous. No loundry service or room service, the room cleaning could be better and the kitchen appliances need an update (rusty toaster) and small supplies (sponge, dish soap, seasoning groceries, etc)",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,3
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Jaime M,187,Jaime Mwrote a review Sep 2016,"I had read about Reid's many years ago and decided I would stay there when I visited Madeira. I was not disappointed. The hotel exudes old charm (with utmost comfort). We had a \"charming room\", which is the smallest category, but it was very comfortable and we had a splendid sea view. Sumptuous breakfast, direct access to the sea, splendid gardens, kind reception staff, and lots of atmosphere. Wish I had stayed longer.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Lorrainefox,56,Lorrainefoxwrote a review Jun 2015,"Just returned from a weeks stay here with my husband and 20 year old daughter. The apartment was massive, very clean and had everything you needed. The wi fi was very fast and free, we did have the same problem as an earlier reviewer with just getting 2 sets of towels but the housekeeper was usually around to give us more. The rooms don't get cleaned in a Sunday and the towels only get changed every other day, this wasn't really a problem though. We had B&B and the breakfast was ok I've had better but I've had much worse. We only went to the bar twice it was very dark would have gone more if there had been any outside tables and chairs, that said the bar tender made fab cocktails and happy hour prices very cheap 50% off (not the cocktails though)I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here there were a few loud groups of hens/ stags staying over the first weekend and a very large middle aged man in a Mancini showing off in the pool,quite entertaining though. Beware the pool is quite cold and not really suitable for small children as there is no shallow end. The local area is beautiful only went to the strip once and that was in the day not for me I'm afraid to say but the old town was nice still quite lively but not so tacky. I would recommend this place and will be returning.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,3
Saccharum,Gazoak,21,Gazoakwrote a review Dec 2021,"We spent a week at this hotel on a b&b basis in late November. Everything was close to perfect. We booked a full sea view room and were allocated room 501 on the fifth floor, the end room with the largest balcony, (lucky for us). The room was fantastic, open plan with a huge bed and large walk-in shower, lots of well lit storage, fridge, safe and large wall mounted TV. My only criticism , the wash hand basin was of a very shallow modern design with no plug (this wasn’t missing, there is just no facility for a plug which made wet shaving a little difficult). We opted for an early breakfast 7.30-8.30am. The restaurant was very clean with plenty of staff and a huge choice, hot or cold including Cava sparkling wine. The breads were excellent and my wife particularly enjoyed the pancakes which were cooked to order. They even cater for vegans! The fly bar on the roof was classy and the pools were lovely but not heated (the sea was warmer). There is a beach bar and private bathing terrace in front of the beach with shower. The hotel is well positioned at the East end of the resort and only 3-4 minutes walk from the bars and restaurants at the marina. There is also a good Pingo Doce supermarket adjacent to the enclosed beaches. We will definitely return.",Dec,2021,Dec 2021,2021-12-01,2021,4

Upon first exploring the grounds, there is a white horse. According to helpful hotel staff, the horse & the land it is chained on belong to a local who I haven’t seen at all during my stay. Her small water bowl was always empty. That is my one and only complaint about this stay. It was very depressing to look out and see this horse chained for days on end with no owner ever coming to care for it. I love all animals and had I seen someone caring for this horse atleast once, I could depart in peace. Instead.. I leave with worry and heartbreak.",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,4

You can see the subway station and the Rossio train station from the hotel, it's that close. We could not have asked for a better location, hence the 4 Star rating.The hotel experience itself I'd give a 3 star. It reminded me of a hostel type hotel when I was a teenager. Noisy location currently due to reno's directly across the alley way which our room faced. Buffet is a crowded, cafeteria type setting but it's free.The room is ridiculously small but it had a very comfy bed. Upgrade to a normal size room if you've got large luggage or you're a human with a stocky build. I'm a slight build and even that little bathroom was hard to be in. Sit on the toilet and lean forward and you'll wack your head off of the sink LOL it's so tight in there.Staff was very pleasant.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Ray-Edwards,58,Ray-Edwardswrote a review Jun 2023,"Sadly I think this might be the last time we'll be staying here, we've been coming here for many years.Recent reviews on TripAdvisor for this hotel have been remarkably accurate, so I won't go into detail about e.g. it not really being a 4 star hotel (because it's a long way off), or the noise/lack of finesse or the breakfast quality. The breakfast is superb.What I find disappointing is that the hotel hasn't kept up to date or with the times. We first came here with our children nearly 20 years ago, and it's exactly the same as it was then. The hotel surrounds you with images of other Vila Gale hotels that look amazing, even the small TV in bedroom blasts a glossy loop of advertising for their other properties both in Portugal and elsewhere.The place is spotless, the staff incredibly friendly welcoming, but for Â£150 a night it's too outdated now, tired furniture and fittings.Sadly I think it's going to be another hotel the next time we visit this wonderful town, I'd like a bit more quality for my holiday next time.Having said all of that, if you get an incredible deal somehow for the place and don't mind a 3 star hotel as a base for B&B then it would represent value for money.",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,3

From the moment we booked the communication was second-to-none, making for a seamless stay. The atmosphere in the hotel is so warm and friendly. The staff are all lovely and service is excellent. We were staying with our 13-month-old and she was made to feel so welcome, from the basket of lovely wooden toys placed in our room to her very own plastic cutlery and crockery at breakfast. And as everyone says, breakfast is not to be missed.We were in the City View Suite in the 3rd floor and we couldnâ€™t fault it. The whole hotel is beautifully designed - a lot of thought has clearly gone into making it look visually stunning while still feeling relaxed and welcoming. On top of this Canto de Luz is located in a great area - calm, close to lots of interesting little restaurants, cafes and shops, away from the main tourist areas, but near a metro station and an easy walk to anywhere you might want to go. We will definitely be back and look forward to trying out their other properties. We really couldnâ€™t recommend it highly enough. You will not regret booking here.

Cidnay Santo Tirso - Charming Hotel & Executive Center,Ema Datshi,551,Ema Datshiwrote a review Dec 2009,"I just returned from my second visit to the Cidnay and I loved it even more than the first time. The hotel is poorly described as being in Porto - it's actually about 15 minutes drive from Porto airport in the small town of Santo Tirso. But if you have a need to be in ST then this is a great hotel.The hotel sits on the side of a hill - and the lobby which you enter directly off the street, is actually the top floor with the rooms, conference facilities etc on three lower floors. The rooms are large and well equipped though so far I've not managed to get one with a view of more than the car park.The restaurant and bar have spectacular views over the hillside. Both are very stylishly decorated with fantastic panoramic windows. There's a large outdoor terrace that I've not yet managed to use because it's always raining!We had a two day meeting in the hotel. The meeting rooms were of good size, well equipped and comfortable. The lunch buffets were exceptionally good and the staff were all very pleasant.As I mentioned, this was my second visit. When I checked in late at night the receptionist said \"Last time you were here you left a book in your room\". I was shocked - it had been 18 months earlier but during the entire time they'd kept my book and had now placed it back in my room for me.",Dec,2009,Dec 2009,2009-12-01,2009,4

We left our valuable belongings (money, 4 passports, credit cards and other documents) in the safe, the next day we returned to the hotel after walking around and FOUND THE SAFE OPEN AND EMPTY. It was a terrifying experience, feeling like everything had been stolen from us! We were very far from home, without passports, without credit cards and with a few Euros in our pockets. We notified the reception, they did not know how to explain what happened, we asked to speak to the manager, they said he was on his way to the hotel, we wanted to call the police to file a report and they told us that first they must find out what happened, after about an hour they said that THEY TOOK THE SAFE THAT WAS IN OUR ROOM TO REPAIR BECAUSE IT HAD A DEFECT AND THEY DID NOT COMMUNICATE ANYTHING TO US AND THEY LEFT ANOTHER BOX IN THE ROOM . We couldn't believe it!! I only arrived about half an hour after they returned our valuables onThe Reception Manager apologized, said that what happened was very serious, that it was an employee's mistake, that he was grateful because we could have said that there was more money there and made a claim, BUT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER DIRECTLY , that he was out of Lisbon and that he would talk to us the next day. We told him that it was not an employee's mistake but a serious failure in the hotel's processes and that the person should not be fired because the hotelHe was responsible. With all this my mother feltVery bad, she suffered a nervous breakdown, we had to call 911 for help, a psychologist helped her reduce her crisis with breathing and talking to her. THE MANAGER NEVER SHOWED UP OR CALLED. They left a plate with pieces of fruit and 2 truffles in the room, without a note of apology AT ALL.

The bed is directed to the window, offering great views even from the bed. Unfortunately you have to sit in the bed for the view, since the windows are higher than the beds.Our spa experience started with a little discussion because our son was not allowed to use the sauna – too dangerous for a 13 year old boy. Since there was nobody else using the facility and he is really used to saunas and knows how to behave in a quiet spa, we didn’t really see the point of that rule, but we accepted it and brought the boy into the room. My wife, daughter and I then tried to enjoy the sauna, which does have a great view indeed. We didn’t wear swimsuits, but were totally covered with towels. Still nobody else using the sauna. The spa manager had an eye on us, though, and came into the sauna telling us that we would have to wear swim suits under the towels. We had an unbelievable discussion and this time we did not accept his request. He went off to call assistance, but didn’t come back.Well, if you never understood why these nordic people use the saunas without swimsuits, if you were never interested to know anyway, if you don’t mind to ruin your swimsuits and if you love these nice traces people leave in the pool when their swimsuits are soaked full with sweat – then this spa is the place for you – enjoy ;-)",Jan,2015,Jan 2015,2015-01-01,2015,4

Vila Galé Coimbra,Chrissy M,4,Chrissy Mwrote a review Nov 2015,"I stayed in Hotel Vila Gale for around 2 weeks and had a wonderful stay. I stayed with my mother whilst settling in Coimbra before beginning university there.The rooms were clean and well presented, just as I like them. The bathroom allowed the option of either a bath or a shower and decorated in a modern fashion. The view from the balcony is of the River Mondego, a very pretty view to wake up to.Another plus, is that this hotel is very close to the station, so if you have a lot of luggage like I did, you won't have to lug it around too much not pay a very heavy taxi fair.Beyond the physical perks of this hotel, is the exceptional and friendly staff, who made settling in that much easier. Extremely attentive and able to converse in Spanish, English and Portuguese - communication is no problem and even helped my mother organise transportation to her flight in Porto, finding the cheapest methods for her.Although perhaps a tad more pricey than other accommodation in Coimbra, you'll find the service and amenities well worth the price. With the option of an outdoor or indoor pool, as well as a steam room and gym to use at your dispense, you'll have plenty to do on a rainy day - depending what month you choose to arrive.Admittedly, the train line running past isn't the most attractive feature, you barely notice it - if at all. It does not disrupt sleep whatsoever.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4

Rochavau Hotel,Steffi K,0,Steffi Kwrote a review Oct 2024,Very nice hotel and very friendly stuff that is always there to help.It is only short walk to the beach and there is a nice restaurant next door.The breakfast area is a little bit small and unfortunately there is often a line at the coffee machine but it is not too bad.,Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,4
