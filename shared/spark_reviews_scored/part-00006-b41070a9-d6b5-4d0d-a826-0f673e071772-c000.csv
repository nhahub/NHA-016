Quinta Mirabela,panama_patti,118,panama_pattiwrote a review Dec 2012,"I should have written this review back in February/March but forgot - must be an age thing.If you are contemplating going to Funchal, and you do not mind a bit of exercise (or getting buses/taxis), then this hotel is a MUST.A boutique hotel but with the service and quality you would expect for a larger, luxury brand hotel.The hotel manager was a god send - helped us out no end when we hit problems with our flight home.The room was lovely, very clean and wonderfully serviced each day.Our evening meals were wonderfully cooked and presented.I would be very surprised if we returned to Funchal (been there, done that - and it's a whole big world out there), but if we ever did, then I would return to The Quinta Mirabela.",Dec,2012,Dec 2012,2012-12-01,2012,3
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Joe B,0,Joe Bwrote a review Oct 2024,"Not great.  Main restaurant food quality very poor.  Mostly inedible, terrible tasting food.  Salmon made us all sick for two days.  Hot snack served between lunch and dinner was so bad we all spat it out, burger and hotdog tastes of Mr muscle cleaner.  Resorted to eating cold ham sandwiches from snack bar.  Stayed at cheaper 4 star all inclusive in Algarve with much better food quality, served right up to midnight, where this stops at 9:30. The hotel is too big with too many to cater for, so much food sat around for too long, flies were everywhere.  Wasn't cheap, won't be returning.  The two premium restaurants were delicious.",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,2

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Emma H,4,Emma Hwrote a review Apr 2022,We arrived here was quiet.food is bland and very cold. Long time to get food.. staff wasn’t very trained at serving at bar or in restaurant. my husband got food poisoning few days before departure. The nights are very cold think hotel would provide patio heaters. The night entertainment is in a large tent. The entertainment was rubbish my 9 year and 12 year old wasn’t interested at all. Room wasn’t cleaned throughly just fresh towels and bed made up. I expected more cleaning they was dust and black mould around shower screen…Wouldn’t rate this a 5 star. Had better treatment in a 3 star hotel… wouldn’t recommend at all!!,Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,3

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Smudges567,0,Smudges567wrote a review Jun 2025,"Disappointing Decline – No Longer Worth the PriceWe’ve stayed at this hotel as a family three times now, with our first visit back in 2022 when free child places were available. That first trip was fantastic value—our daughter loved the pools, and the entertainment was genuinely impressive. The animation team went out of their way to make sure both kids and adults had a brilliant time.We returned in 2024. While it wasn’t quite as good as our first experience, we still felt it offered decent value, even though the free child places were no longer available. The food remained good, although the entertainment had noticeably dropped in quality.We've just come back from our most recent stay and sadly, the standard continues to decline. What’s particularly frustrating is that the cost of the holiday has almost doubled since 2022. The removal of free child places has clearly contributed, but even so, the overall price now feels expensive for what you get. It’s certainly not what I would consider a 5-star hotel experience.There are no longer any themed food nights, so the buffet is repetitive and quite bland—we often found ourselves resorting to pizza most nights. The restaurant service has also deteriorated; we were rarely asked if we wanted drinks, and staff seemed more focused on whipping away your plate the second you finish your last mouthful.The pool area was very busy, and unless you got up early to reserve a lounger, it was difficult to find a spot anywhere near the pool—not exactly relaxing. That said, the pool facilities and slides are still great fun for both adults and children. While the pools are unheated and quite cold, this hasn’t really bothered us as a family.Evening entertainment has become very limited. Aside from the animation team dancing each night—which is fine once, but repetitive after that—there wasn’t much else on offer.The lifts were another major issue. There’s supposed to be a system to reduce overcrowding, but in reality, they were slow, often full, and people frequently ignored the queueing system. One lift seemed to be out of order for the whole stay, which made things worse—especially for anyone staying on higher floors.Overall, it’s disappointing to see a hotel we once really enjoyed slide so far in quality while the price continues to rise. Unless significant improvements are made, we won’t be returning.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,2
Artbeat Rooms,Kidsan_16,20,Kidsan_16wrote a review Jun 2015,"Our stay at Artbeat Rooms was an absolute pleasure and was a great base for exploring the city over a 3 day period. The hostel is about a 5 minute walk from Baxia tube - which in turn is an easy 30 min journey from the Airport metro. It can be a little tricky to find so look for the number 23 above some green double doors - just after a shop selling electric razors and other odds and ends.The hostel is in one of the only flat areas of Lisbon and its proximity to the waterfront made it very easy to find. An advantage that should not be overestimated!We stayed in the Hirst room which was comfortable and spacious - there is no cupboard space - but  there is enough room around to hang up clothes and store a suitcase or two without hassle. The highlight of the room is the balcony area overlooking the street which is perfect for breakfast or glass of wine in the evening. The restaurant below plays music - but amazingly it played a consistently good selection of relaxed songs that added to the ambiance over the trip.The hosts were very welcoming and their tips and fun map really added to our trip. I would recommend the evening of Fado at the Pavo restaurant for couples seeking some good food and Portuguese music. Also visiting Sintra is a must - the Quinta da Regaleira was our highlight - but make sure to bring a torch to explore all the secret passages. Make sure to get the combined Sintra train, bus and attraction pass from Lisbon town centre - we didn't and ended up queuing for ages when we got there!My only slight negative for Artbeat was the continental breakfast was quite limited if you are not a cereal or toast appreciator. However, you are given the full run of the facilities and are able to make fresh orange juice in the morning and take advantage of a cheap mini bar system in the evening which I enjoyed :)Overall - 100% recommend and would stay there again should I visit Lisbon in the future",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,4
"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",Anita K,11,Anita Kwrote a review Nov 2017,"We stayed at the Pine Cliff Ocean Suites for 4 nights in October. The resort was beautiful, open, spacious and well appointed. The rooms were large and the apartments were larger. The bathroom was the open type with sliding glass door. The Balcony opened out with a view of the pool. It was simply beautifully done. We enjoyed walking around the huge property, it took us 20 minutes to go from the Ocean Suites to the Residences where we had an event. The provide with you a vehicle for transfer if needed.The beach is a small walk down the cliff and it is just spectacular. Algarve is truly the Best Kept Secret in Portugal. The water is cool and the sand is white. I would love to go back there again.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,5

Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,lcmcdonough,96,lcmcdonoughwrote a review Dec 2014,"Our family of six (four adults, two children) stayed in the two-bedroom apartment, and enjoyed our three-night stay. Olivia, our proprietor, was fantastic and so helpful, allowing us to leave our bags early (we arrived several hours before check-in) to making restaurant recommendations for our family. The accommodations were modern, but I think six people in a two-bedroom apartment (with a sofa bed) and a very small water heater is a stretch. We made it work, but I think the space is far more suitable for four people. The location is amazing - a short walk to the major sites in Porto and Gaia, and surrounded by great shopping and just a few doors down from the port institute (you must go and do their port tasting flight!). Overall, I would definitely recommend Casas do Porto, and am very grateful to Olivia for her hospitality.",Dec,2014,Dec 2014,2014-12-01,2014,4

From the room which was in the 1st floor with a view to a fence to an nonexistent WiFi with no signal, fitness center with a very limited schedule and a very pricey restaurant (really pricey) where only the desert was somehow good.

Good friendly vibe around the pool. Not a lot happening locally around the hotel but with Uber being well priced in Lisbon this isn’t a problem. I’ve left a separate review for the Tapas & Tiles bar/ restaurant which was a shocker as I don’t want to take away from the hotel itself.,Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,4

The hotel is beautiful - perched on a cliff above the ocean, just a short walk to the center of Funchal.  The service was outstanding at every level.  Every contact we had with anyone on the hotel staff was perfect.  Restaurants are all good.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Alvin C,210,Alvin Cwrote a review Nov 2024,The main reason of this review is to thank Tatiana at the front desk.  She was so professional and courteous and friendly when we checked in on the night of November 6th.  That first impression makes all the difference in customer service.  Five stars to her!!This is a beautiful hotel.  The lobby is very spacious and wide.  The room was nice and clean.  And with our Marriott titanium status we had access to the lounge and that in itself was spectacular.  Both the breakfast in the lounge and in the basement were excellent.

Porto Cinema Apartments,Julia L,29,Julia Lwrote a review May 2018,"We stayed in 1B, the Lost in Translation apartment. The location is the best, right in the middle of everything. We had two (narrow) balconys, facing two directions. It gives you great opportunity to have coffe or wine in the sun, while you observe the people and the trams passing by outside.The apartment had everything we needed (or more), including a Nespresso machine, a dishwasher and Netflix. It was clean. The only downside, as we saw it, was that it was a bit noisy in the early night hours. There was traffic noise and people walking by talking loudly. We had no problem sleeping, but if you’re sensitive to noises you might want to pack ear plugs.However, we would stay here again, if we came back to Porto.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,4

Luna Clube Oceano,Davina S,7,Davina Swrote a review Jun 2013,"Read some of these reviews before we went to Clube Oceano and yes I was a little worried with some of the comments, but on our arrival we were pleasantly greeted and given the keys to our room, and also a map of the local area which highlighted the local supermarkets and other useful information.  We were on the top floor and had a good sea view and also a view of the pool which was ideal for people of all ages. Our apartment had everything you needed for a self-catering holiday, it was very clean and spacious,  the only minor down side was the bathroom which was a little tired looking, but this did not spoil our stay and was still functional. I can not fault the staff at the hotel, they were very friendly including the staff at the poolside bar. Ask if I would go again my answer would be yes.

Royal Savoy Hotel,Jo W,11,Jo Wwrote a review Sep 2015,"We returned to the Royal Savoy recently, having bought a time share room in 2003 and since then, making about 12 visits.There have been previous occasions when we have feared that the hotel was likely to lose its 5 star status, but not this time!We noted numerous improvements to the service and amenities in the hotel.  Firstly, the staff were far more welcoming and obliging.  I made a note of particular staff and mentioned them in my questionnaire at the end of our holiday, but pool, food and beverege staff at the decks, together with room maids were particularly pleasant.A lovely new touch were the Moulton Brown products in the bathroom and the beautiful basket of fruit provided in our room.The rooms had fresh bedding every other day and were kept scrupulously clean, together with our outside verandah.Only one complaint.  The wifi in all areas of the hotel was not good enough. I was unable to send an email for the whole of the two week period.However, that aside, we are very much looking forward to our next visit and I can thoroughly recommend the Royal Savoy to future visitors.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4
Royal Savoy Hotel,nearlyfiftyNorthwood,4,nearlyfiftyNorthwoodwrote a review Aug 2016,"A very comfortable hotel/time share development. Two beautiful swimming pools, one extremely well heated. Direct access to the sea also. Nicely situated just outside of Funchal. Plenty of taxis if the hilly terrain of Madeira do not suit you. Otherwise, its a 20 minute walk into the centre.The outlook from the patios mainly good, although some are somewhat overlooked. All seemed to face the sea.The entertainment at night in the hotel was acceptable but not of a very high standard. I think in view of this, there wasnt a large crowd and as a lot of the guests are timeshare owners, they have seem the acts before and dont attend.Breakfast was excellent. A very wide choice of hot and cold foods, eggs freshly cooked as you wish and of a very good quality. The meals in the restaurant at night seemed expensive so we always ate out at one of the many local restaurants.Madeira has a relaxed pace of life, and the locals are particularly friendly. We were not there in summer school holiday time when the area is probably much busier and more families on holiday.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4
Saccharum,Johanna,9,Johannawrote a review May 2023,"I was looking at my reviews on TripAdvisor when I saw my previous review of this hotel where I gave it 4 stars. Still not bad of course, but I wanted to write another review as me and my husband have been back to Saccharum twice(!) after my first review. So I thought about writing a new review. This is now our favorite hotel on Madeira, as it’s not as crowded like a lot of hotels in Funchal. Calheta is beautiful and not crowded at all. We really appreciate privacy and a calm environment when we go on holiday, and Saccharum is great for this! Sometimes restaurants are packed with other tourists and you’re seated a couple centimeters away from other guests but here at Saccharum you can eat all relaxed in whatever restaurant of the hotel you please. We really like the bar next to the sea, Calhau. They have nice vegetarian options for me. Also everything is clean and hygiene is great. That’s so important to me. So after our new experiences at this hotel I’ve wanted to change my 4-star review into a 5-star review. We are now planning to take my parents to Madeira in October of this year to show them this beautiful island, and we will be staying at Saccharum!",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,4
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Penelope K,4,Penelope Kwrote a review Apr 2022,"We booked a weeks holiday with friends after the disappointment of having to cancel one in the Caribbean. What we found in Reid’s was a holiday that passed our expectations and has made us want to return for more.The modest roadside appearance of Reid’s belied the jewel that awaited us on arrival.Through the elegant reception area we got a glimpse both of the gorgeous views that lay beyond, but also the terrace where we enjoyed the famous afternoon tea during our stay.Our junior garden suite was spacious and extremely comfortable, and luckily for us convenient to the quirky lift arrangement which  indicated the history and development of the hotel.The staff were always attentive and happy to help. Mostly discreet, their part in making our holiday memorable cannot be understated. Some in particular should be mentioned: Wei on the door was always the welcoming face of Reid’s, Antonio preparing sun beds for guests was completing his last week in a 49 year employment (!!) and then most especially Basile an intern on his 8th consecutive day serving drinks and snacks in the pool area and at breakfast a highlight who went the extra mile and has definitely found his metier in the tourism industry.The view from the cocktail bar meant it became a stop off for a nightcap on the way back to our room.The gardens too are worth a visit.Thankyou to everyone at this splendid hotel.

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Paul N,138,Paul Nwrote a review May 2023,"I cannot believe it's 16 years since our last visit, a week in the summer here used to be a regular trip in the early 2000's. Some things have obviously changed but actually much remains the same - classic, traditional but not stuffy.Our room was in the Garden Wing and it's worth booking a sea view which takes in  bit of the garden, the sea, the port, the town and the hills. We spent a lot of afternoon and  evening time on our balcony which was also pleasantly private. The room is well furnished, queen bed and everything needed. Complimentary soft drinks are a nice touch. Maid service excellent - friendly and picked up some good tips for restaurants and walks from them.Meals. Breakfast is served in and outside the pool bar, a big improvement from it's previous location, We were able to sit outside every day and the breakfast food is  superb, both the quality and the huge variety. Daily specials in addition to the hot buffet are provided along with multiple juice and hot drink choices - amuse bouche pastries were another nice touch. We didn't use the pool bar in the day as we were usually out walking around the Island but we did eat in the Cipriani, the William and had afternoon tea on the famous covered terrace. TIP - do book these well in advance  as leaving this to arrival may leave you disappointed. The Cipriani was good, the William excellent (it is expensive but perfect for a treat) and the Afternoon Tea a must do for the experience alone (but the Champagne is overpriced with no other fizz option).Staff. A real highlight, everyone was so welcoming and friendly right the way through from reception,  the concierge team, the restaurant staff, the maids and the senior team - Sarah was very helpful and the Manager, Sr Campus was very visible throughout. There is a weekly welcome drinks evening  and also, in good weather, an outdoor Taste of Madeira dinner which combines great food and wine with stunning views.I would say communication of \"what's on\" is a little hit and miss. There are two notice boards but I think many people would probably not see them and few events were communicated by any messages left in the room. For example, we only found out about the Taste of Madeira evening by looking at the website! We missed there was a  screening of the Coronation in the Cinema room and also we saw no details of what the spa facilities/treatments were.A novelty was the poolside is the daily visit of a Harris Hawk to help keep the pigeons and gulls at bay. Nice to chat with some of the handlers and see these wonderful birds up close.16 years was too long, we'll be returning in 2024.",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,4

At least they are trying.Only downside was the family of 9 who used to reserve sun beds and parasosl and then take off for the day, I know this is a general complaint  and there were signs up but no notice taken of them, a suggestion would l d be to have a pool attendant to keep an eye on things as no one wants to fight for a sun bedBeing an infiniti member and paying a lot of maintenance every year, the least I would expect would be a sun longer",Aug,2014,Aug 2014,2014-08-01,2014,4

All staff are very friendly, helpful and speak good English.The room i stayed at 5th floor comes with kitchen, DVD player, TV, living room a terrace facing the sea; very spacious. We prepare our breakfast and had it at the terrace to enjoy the sea view. One lovely thing is the chocolate they placed on the bed after making up the room, delicious and sweet move...it has 3 pools. two outdoor pools with salt water, one warm and one cold. we just love it and spent at least 2 hour per day at the pool. ANother one we did not try is the indoor pool.There are many good restaurants around in  less than 5min walk; some are Michelin Star which I tried was fantastic. super market just 50m away. Casino is 500m away. Madeira center,  old town and marina and just within walking distance (10-15 min walk alone the sea).Food at the restaurant  is average, but service is excellent.One issue is the the road in front of the hotel is a slope. walking to marina and old town is ok, because is down hill. walking to main street above can be quite tiring because is uphill.Another thing is Wi-fi only available at ground floor and 1st floor at the library area. SO one will need to brig their laptop or smartphone to these area to access the internet.All and  all we had a wonderful stay at this lovely and quiet resort.",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,4

Natura Algarve Club,Craig A,83,Craig Awrote a review Sep 2019,"We stayed at Natura for a quick one week break in August and I have to say we were impressed for a late booking.We arrived early morning due to a very early flight and the 4pm check in is strictly enforced so there was no room available.  However, a very friendly receptionist started the check in process with us and then allowed us to leave our bags in the luggage room.  There were rest rooms in reception to change in and we then enjoyed the rest of the day by the pool before returning to reception at 5pm to get the room keys and finalise check in.  There is a refundable 100 euro deposit to pay but you are pre-warned and we got evey penny back depsite a very early check out on our way home, which was done by the hotel security - as long as you look after your room, I don't see why this would be a problem for anyone.When reporting back to complete check in after a very nice first day around the pool, the extremely helpful receptionist actually showed us to the room, whihc happens very rarely these days and was a nice touch.  We stayed in a pool view studio, which was just right for three of us.  We normally prefer a one bed apartment so that the bedroom is separated from the living space but this was the only available room at late notice.  It had everything you need though, three comfortable beds, a small tv, decent sized kitchen and bathroom with usual mod cons.  The main selling points of the rooms are the free air conditioning, which is very nice to come back to after a day at the pool.  The rooms also have a nice balcony and an electric shutter over the balcony doors, which as well as providing added security, also acts as an amazing black out blind if you fancy a lazy morning!The pool at the hotel was excellent, really nice big size with plenty of sun beds.  There is no real fight to get them and most weren't taken until well after 10am so no rushing to be up at the crack of dawn.  The beds also turn over during the day so there always seemed to be some available.  The hotel also has a lot of grassed areas around the pool so worst case scenario you can also just throw the towel down and still have a comfortable time.  There is also entertainment around the pool most afternoons from 3pm, which varies from bands to parrot shows so something for everyone.The hotel had a really nice atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff and was well located.  At the top of the road are a number of restaurants and a big intermarche supermarket.  There is a taxi rank a little further down the road, though you are in walking distance of the strip.  The distance to the old town really probably requires a taxi at between 5-8 euros, though it can be walked if you want to work up an appetite for the evening!We had a great stay and would certainly return.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

Legends' House by Sweet Porto,T-SGlobetrotters,950,T-SGlobetrotterswrote a review Jan 2024,"We stayed here for five nights over New Year 2023. First and foremost, the location is excellent, close to most of the main sights and convenient both for the train station and metro giving convenient access to the airport. We stayed in a comfortable one bed studio with kitchenette and adjoining lounge area, the one featured on the website which is representative of the actual room. The studio also backs onto the rear garden so it was very quiet even though it was the New Year holiday. Kitchenette was very well equipped with refrigerator, coffee maker, electric kettle, oven, two ring hob and plenty of utensils. TV had Netflix/Prime. Very comfortable bed, good shower with plenty of hot water and plenty of space to make our stay a good one. We opted for the daily continental breakfast which is delivered to your door daily and is quite substantial with fruit, yoghurt, croissants, bread coffee or tea and juice.Very friendly staff made this an excellent stay.",Jan,2024,Jan 2024,2024-01-01,2024,5
Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Pinkfizz31,192,Pinkfizz31wrote a review Aug 2018,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and 3 days, we chose the hotel for the roof top outdoor pool and also for the gym both of which were disappointing. The pool on the roof is tiny and waist deep at most, itâ€™s fine for cooling off but notice swimming or sharing, there is no bar service on the roof and only 3 thin umbrellas for shade, the loungers are poor quality too. It does have good views and is a sun trap however hence need for umbrellas.The gym is again tiny with limited equipment and space, a wooden floor which makes working out harder as things make a loud noise all the time, no music and no AC it is in the spa and hence spa temperatures. Not enjoyable at all so I ended up running out side where there is a nice long track along the river.The room itself was fine but not 5 star, the AC made the room feel damp and sticky, the housekeeping mediocre.Front desk were helpful but when checking in didnâ€™t mention anything about where things are or when breakfast is etc. Breakfast is just ok there is a menu to order eggs but you have to beg for it and then the options are limited. No granola and no smoothies and very standard selection on buffet.The bar is dark and soulless outside is nicer but service can be slow.We still had an average stay and there is a nice option of walks near to the hotel and town in an Uber is 8 euros which is what we expected however we wouldnâ€™t stay again as it was more 3 star than the luxury portrayal on the website which has some creative photograph to say the least.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,2

Pestana Viking,Tribble123,3,Tribble123wrote a review Jul 2017,"Stayed here for 8 nights on B&B basis at the beginning of July.Very pleased with the service we received from housekeeping, waiting-on staff and especially reception staff, in particular Louisa and the lady with the blonde hair who helped me after a fall. Our room (Classic double with garden view) was on the 7th floor (top) and had views of the surrounding gardens, (but not the hotel's) neighbouring complexes and the road. A reasonable view, if not quite what was advertised.  The WiFi and air conditioning worked well in our room and the little kitchenette was very useful for 2 people who ate most meals out, but i'm not sure how a family would cope as there is no cooker.  But for us the fridge, microwave and kettle were adequate and the cupboards well stocked with cutlery and crockery, even a pair of scissors and a corkscrew (both came in very handy).  The only things you need to buy are washing up liquid and a dish cloth.  Which are a reasonable price from the large supermarket at the top of the road.I would have given this hotel 4 stars but for the following things:The décor in the room was worn and needed refreshingOn the last 2 days of our holiday the hotel became much busier and there was an immediate decline in the standard of the facilities, i.e. no toilet paper or hand tissues in the toilets in the communal areas.  At breakfast, which for the rest of our stay had been excellent, both in choice and quality of food (except the juices and coffee which are truly terrible!), it was impossible to find a table that was set, I ended up colleting the cutlery and setting a table myself, no expresso cups - I think this is because the expresso was the best of the drinks from the machine, so therefore the cups went first.The grounds, pool area and facilities were all good, however, in the last couple of days the indoor pool became impossible to swim in as there were many unsupervised kids messing about with no regard for anyone trying to swim.The evening entertainment was limited, but on the night it was on the band/singers were very good.We had a lovely holiday and the area is stunning.  The hotel, which I would say is not quite 4 star, was reasonable for the price that we paid and we would go back again, if we were offered the same deal, but a week or 2 earlier to avoid the sudden influx of guests.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,4

Upon arrival we were greeted by long queues of people either checking out or complaining to the front desk. No welcome or anything as we entered with our cases. After 30mins waiting I had to really kick up a fuss to my wifeâ€™s embarrassment to get more staff to check us in or we were going to leave. Eventually getting to our basic room, we checked out the hotel. By night the bar area was rowdy most nights with groups you g men playing electronic darts and drinking heavily so we went elsewhere after that. Breakfast was an equally noisy and busy affair, queuing for tables with people feasting like it was their last supper. We were so sorry we hadnâ€™t booked the Maria Nova in town where we had stayed many times, but thought we would have a change. Never again....",Jan,2020,Jan 2020,2020-01-01,2020,1

Take your time with delicious breakfast; walk the grounds; chat it up with the staff or other guests in the cozy salon; or simply \"chill\"; meditate, play chess or cards; read a book; take a swim; sip some Porto, tea, or cafe in the comfortable salon or contemplative gardens; share with your partner...Engage the Cascais and greater Lisboa and Belem communities at your doorstep confident that a warm welcome and good \"vibes\" await your return to Casa Vela.

Hotel El Rei Dom Manuel,bcqajbk,142,bcqajbkwrote a review May 2009,"Once again, we were led to the perfect choice by tripadvisor reviewers. This inn is easy to find in this charming town of twisted, narrow streets.  As soon as you go through the town gates, the albergaria is straight ahead.  You will be warmly greeted by Dom Manuel.  He is the designer, owner and proprietor and is quite proud of the inn he has created.  And he deserves to be proud!Our room was on the second floor with french doors on two sides of the room and a balcony/patio  that poked out of  the roof----the views of both the valley (one way) and the town and castle(the other way) were just fantastic.  When making a reservation, request  one of the rooms with a view--I can only assume that it will make your stay even more special.The room itself was  good size.  It was charmingly decorated and immaculately clean.The bathroom was modern and stocked with all of the amenities.We ate dinner in the inn's restaurant.  It was a very pleasant atmosphere and the food was fine......we didn't see many other choices in town and were too tired to go to the pousada (which, by the way, is very hard to find and when we did we also saw swarms of  flying insects.....not at all impressed and we were very happy we had not spent the extra money to stay there).Did I mention the unbelievably low rate for this inn?  We paid 65 euros--the least on our trip---and this was really a wonderful property.  Do not be afraid to book due to the very low price----it is worth far more!",May,2009,May 2009,2009-05-01,2009,5

I had e-mailed the hotel when booking and, on arrival, was upgraded to a deluxe room with spa bath on balcony etc.  Check in was smooth and easy and although the room wasn't ready, the wait was well worth it.  We were escorted to the room and all facilities explained.  Faultless.Breakfasts were ok - I am a pastry fiend so the continental breakfasts suited me well.  Would have liked self service coffee though as I need this by the gallon to get going.We had dinner in the hotel's gourmet restaurant for my wife's birthday which was expensive but well worth it.  A birthday cake and sparkling wine awaited us on our return to the room.  A very nice touch.We spent one afternoon in the spa which is the best I have experienced.  Would have liked to have spent more time here!Location - we had no problem with this.  Belem is beautiful and the Torre, monastery and discoveries monuments are only a stroll away.  The Pasteis de Belem pastry heaven again is only a short walk away and is unmissable.  There are various other restaurants in the area as well as the hotel's own less formal restaurant.  You can catch the no.15 tram at the monastery as well as a number of buses and can therefore be in central Lisbon within minutes.  Both trams and buses are plentiful.All in all it was an excellent stay and I don't think I could have chosen better.  I have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels and this rated highly, perhaps not for the public areas but for the room and service.(Lisbon tip - Wine Bar de Castelo - one of thebest afternoon's I have spent with great wine , fantastic cheeses and meats and very knowledgable and friendy hosts)",Apr,2011,Apr 2011,2011-04-01,2011,2
