Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Leanne F,2,Leanne Fwrote a review Aug 2025,"We regularly visit this wonderful hotel and only have positive things to say. The views and location are spectacular but the culture of the hotel is testimony to the amazing staff who work here. Every one of them is friendly, welcoming and helpful - even at the busiest of times, and their hard work is evident.This year we tried something new on offer from the hotel - a private wine tasting experience. We can highly recommend. A selection of fabulous Algarvian wines, with the most beautifully crafted, tasty canapés, overlooking the wonderful views from The One restaurant was an experience to remember. Bernardo, our guide, is clearly an expert in his field, his warm manner and his knowledge meant our experience was informative and fun!  Thank you Bernardo!We look forward to trying the mocktail/cocktail making experience next time we visit!Thank you once again Tivoli Carvoeiro, we can’t wait to come back!",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,5

Quinta Mirabela,Fabrice B,2,Fabrice Bwrote a review Jun 2015,The hotel has absolut all standarts.the staff is so friendly and the food and the view over funchal is awesome.The only things I have to complain is 1. The air conditioning was not working properly.The cleaning lady was not really good...saw lot of dirt traces in the bathroom after she cleaned.The shower is not the latest version...The sauna in the spa area looks really cheap and not nice at all.The hotel is a good one but too good rated!,Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,paul H,7,paul Hwrote a review Aug 2022,"I went to his hotel purely for a massage as my hotel uses this hotel as its spa. Zoe was the massage therapist and I have to admit, probably the best massage I have ever had ( and I have a lot of massages on holiday!!!! At least 4-5 every week I am away ). I had a deep tissue and it was perfect, enough pressure to take out the knots but not to much that it hurt. In fact it was that good, the whole family is going tomorrow, says everything really. Thanks",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,5

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Lucy P,28,Lucy Pwrote a review Sep 2016,"First time staying here and was very impressed. Location was very good as it was less than a 5 minute walk to the beach, however you need to get taxis into town to eat etc every night as it is around a 30/ minute walk depending on what side of town you are on. The facilities available such as the gym, spa and pools were fab and very well looked after. Staff were very friendly and helpful!We stayed in a 3 bed apartment for a week - plenty of space and good facilities within the room/kitchen were available. My only niggle was that our apartment only got cleaned twice, one being the afternoon on the day before we went home. This meant we only had one shower towel and one beach towel for the holiday!On the whole it was a very pleasant stay and would stay there again :-)",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Nicole W,0,Nicole Wwrote a review Jun 2024,"This hotel is just okay, the large resort environment I have learned is not my preference. We visited June 6-8, when we arrived my friend was anxious to go the beach but it was closed, we never did get an explanation why. There was a wedding & events taking place at the resort and many of the restaurants were closed to private events. Friday night the sky bar was even closed which was disappointing as the views up there are great. The worst part of our stay was the smell in our room, it was indescribably bad. That said, they sent someone to our room right away to look into it. They did not find the cause but they did put peppermint in the vents and we kept the sliding doors open for the duration of our stay. The staff at the hotel were all professional and pleasant.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,3

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Russell C,51,Russell Cwrote a review Dec 2019,"This was our third hotel stay in a two week holiday and it left the competition standing.  From the moment that we walked in the door the staff were excellent and the standard never dropped for a moment.  The welcome was made to feel extra special with a little welcome taste of local food in the room and a complementary drink at the bar, neither of which we had been expecting.The location to see the city is good but it is on the edge of the key sights, and the taxi did drive through some 'interesting' streets to reach it, that we felt no urge to explore on foot!The room is geared up to short stay visitors with hand luggage, so nowhere to store any clothes and four hangers to use.  We had to live our of suitcases which made space rathe tight. The bed was very comfortable and there was a large bathroom which surprisingly lacked a bidet and the shower fitting was broken and had been so for some time.  Useable but awkward.  There is also a quiet side and noisy side to the hotel.  Our room overlooked the main road which had a constant flow of trams and sirens from the emergency vehicles passing by.  Not overly intrusive but noticeable.We did try to use the television one evening but the computer overlay for the hotel portal made it so slow and unresponsive that we gave up.  Wifi coverage though was good.  Security is up to standard with key access required to use the lifts or stairs.Unfortunately we were ill during our stay (completely unrelated to the hotel).  On our final evening we felt well enough to eat carefully in the restaurant and the chef cooked us a light meal, he then came out to enquire how we were and if the meal was suitable for us.  When I write that the staff were excellent they truly were.Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed.",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,4

Lisbon Destination Hostel,K M,9,K Mwrote a review Sep 2014,"Been to Lisbon twice and stayed this time in the Destination Hostel: and I fully recommend it to everyone who wants to visit Lisbon! The Hostel ist located in the centre of Lisbon; you can reach everything with the metro or by walking (bairro alto for example is a 5 min walk). Restrooms and sanatariy installations are new and clean. It's probably the cleanest hostel i've been to. The staff is very nice and always helpfull; we just had a great time there. The included breakfast was also very good. The atmosphere ist very layed back, i will definetly come back :)",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",Deb N,20,Deb Nwrote a review Aug 2017,"The info on the site is misleading. Some suites have an ocean view...when I called for the reservation they said it was on the ocean so I travelled some distance to get there, any yes, it said Pine Cliffs, so I did ask. Suites are nice. Lots of kids and young families .. big noisy.  Big property, lots of walking or commuting to other areas. All in all, a typical big resort property not on the ocean. A walk down a trail to the beach which is where you feel it's more like a holiday.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,2
A Casa Formosa,WouterVG7,91,WouterVG7wrote a review Sep 2014,"It was the first time in Porto for my girlfriend and me, and it was her idea to book at ` Casa Formosa`. In fact the hostel is the whole second floor of the building, so you first need a key to enter at ground level, a second one to enter the apartment and a third one to go into your own room. At the back there is a charming common kitchen where we made our own breakfast during the morning. Joao provides ingredients almost every day, so yoghurt, fresh fruit, corn flakes, bread and marmelade are all available for your own use. You can share a good bottle of Port or Vinho Verde together with some other guests on one of the two terraces. On the big terrace at the back there are two deckchairs for sunlovers.We slept in the room located closest to the entry which is very spacious and luminous. Apart from the double bed there is huge comfortable red sofa and a low table. I particularly liked the two huge windows, but due to the fact the streets are narrow, cars and person can be rather noisy. Wifi is ok.The apartment has two (also common) bathrooms which are located next to each other. Both have a toilet, lavatory and douche. The one near to the kitchen has a bathtub, the other does not. At night two small candles are lighted to guide your way to the toilet, so you do not have to disturb the other guests.Last but certainly not least is the terrific location. Not far from metro station Bolhão and within walking distance from the more touristic places at the river. Joao will give you excellent advice and recommendations for restaurants (both for heavy as for light meals) and attractions.Overall, this is a way more personal experience of travelling instead of just booking a room in a hotel!",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,4
Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,DundeeVino,94,DundeeVinowrote a review Jun 2018,"Quinta Nova is an isolated estate in one of the oldest vineyards in the Douro.  It has sweeping views of the valley and surrounding vineyards, and the owners have developed several marvelous hikes through the property.  The restaurant served excellent meals, and the service was very good.  One note:  this is an isolated location, so if you want to eat something different from what they offer, you will need to drive a half hour or more.  Our rooms were all very comfortable, well-appointed and everything worked as it should (although all Portuguese hotels seem to think that it is fine for the shower water to drip/spray out onto the bathroom floor!).  For our group, it was our top location in eastern Portugal.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,4

Quinta do Furão,Diana4922,19,Diana4922wrote a review Aug 2013,"My husband and I came for the weekend with our daughter, husband and 2 sons prior to a week in Funchal and we absolutely loved it. We had a charming room in the hotel and they had the 2 bed villa, with a lounge and terrace, in the grounds. The boys, (6 & 4) loved the trip to the Madeira Theme Park, especially the bungee jumping and boat lake, which is only 1o minutes by taxi. We did a wonderful coastal walk, and the setting was sublime. The staff in the hotel were outstanding, helpful and friendly. Great swimming pool too. We all enjoyed the Gala Dinner on Sunday, with entertainment, and all in all it was a terrific choice of hotel.",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,5
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,cyberd,45,cyberdwrote a review Dec 2011,Service and comfort. Rooms are what you can expect of the hotel and the service was impecable. The staff was very very nice. They helped us with all our questions.What I like: Staff and pillows.Location is compromise. Taxis in Lisbon are cheap and is 4-5E to the cinemas/mall and 6-7E to  Barrio Alto (I paid 9E but it was a lot of traffic).Subway is a 10-15 mins walk for me not a big deal. (I use the walk to buy cheap beers in the stores nearby the hotel)What I don't like: Internet 20E per day is way too expensive,Dec,2011,Dec 2011,2011-12-01,2011,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Manny N,54,Manny Nwrote a review Aug 2016,"This is a solid 3 stars hotel. The reason is that while many of the common areas seem to be updated, the rooms are old and smelly. The location is not great, as the hotel is located between two freeways. Downtown Lisbon is about a 10 minutes taxi ride. Taxis will charge about 7 EU for the ride. Amenities within the facility seems adequate. The food is great, although it becomes repetitive after a few days. I guess this hotel is good for business, to so much for exploring Lisboa.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,3
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,unxman,24,unxmanwrote a review Jan 2015,Conveniently  located by American Embassy. It is about  a 7 euro cab ride from the airport or the port. The rooms were nice but small. The bathrooms had been recently modernizes and the view from the rooms was nice. It was very quiet and the staff was extremely helpful. The in room dining was good. I would stay here again. One strange thing is that they do not change currency at the front desk. Internet speed was acceptable for work but had some issues streaming videos.,Jan,2015,Jan 2015,2015-01-01,2015,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,7ericcantona,62,7ericcantonawrote a review Sep 2014,"Overall this hotel is very poor. In terms of positives, the pool and pool area is good (although food service there is excruciatingly slow) and location is ok, walking distance from the (horrendous) 'strip'.The rooms, although spacious, are quite dated and are in need of freshening up. Towels in the bathroom are of terrible quality as is the shower itself. Also they don't clean rooms on Sundays, which is hugely inconvenient. Overall, very poor value for money.If you (have to) stay in Albufeira, choose another hotel.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,2

They all work hard and are commited to keeping the hotels reputation high in Madeira.One area that could certainly do with improvement is their food offerings.  For a 5 star hotel some of the ingredients leave alot to be desired and for the price we were disappointed,the burgers and toastie s at lunchtime were particularly poor.Generally a good hotel.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,annetta_planneta,0,annetta_plannetawrote a review May 2018,"This is one of the best hotels I've been at. The rooms are stylish and clean. The hotel has been recently refurbished so it's all very nicely decorated. The service is just amazing here. Everyone is very nice, friendly and helpful. We've booked directly on their website and got the half board that I can only recommend. The food is different every day (we've stayed 9 nights). The breakfast is top aswell. I'd only suggest a little bit more kinds of fruit (I miss strawberries, watermelon, cantaloupe melone). Oh my, but their pastry for breakfast. My husband is French so he can be a bit picky when it comes to croissant but here they know how to make it ♡. We've been here woth our 11 months old baby. They provided a cute wooden crib (not a travel one as hotels usually do). There's also a cool kids room with nice ladies who are there to play with kids. He loved to spend some time there. I and my husband had a massage too. That was a very lovely experience! Actually one massage was free with our stay! You also get free access to the sauna and other spa facilities.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,CorkSailorMan,145,CorkSailorManwrote a review Aug 2016,"My wife and I visited this hotel with our daughter for a short five day stay.  We booked a junior suite because of the room size in order to have a little extra space.  It was well worth the extra cost.The hotel is positioned near the harbour and has direct access to the excellent beach.  The grounds are generous for the size of the building and we found the pool layout very good with beds both on the timber pool side deck and on the grass around the area.  Umbrellas were substantial offering good shade.  A separate fenced-off small kids area had very good facilities with a decent kiddies pool, loungers for parents and a wonderful pirate ship climbing / activity area and we felt was one of the best we have seen.  The addition of more bins and directional signage to the toilets at the end of the pool would add value.A number of reviews spoke about the glass screen between the bathroom and the bedroom - this caused an element of panic amongst my two ladies until we realised that pressing a switch brought down a blind screen.  This leads me to my first concern which is that the electrics in the rooms are complex and nothing was labelled.  Overall we were delighted with the room which had a huge double bed which was very comfortable and a privacy curtain between that and the sitting area where an additional bed could be set up.  This was not the most comfortable but had plenty of space.  Towels could be better quality.Guests in the junior suites get to eat breakfast in a separate area poolside and in general we found the range of food on offer and the service to be good.  The addition of a good coffee machine at the serving table would be positive.  We ordered breakfast in our room when we were departing early and it was very good and arrived on time.  We did not eat in the hotel other than breakfast.Overall - we were very happy with the hotel and would recommend it hugely.  There is discussion in the reviews as to whether this is 5 star or not - to me that is not very important - we very much enjoyed staying at the hotel and were delighted that we had gone with the junior suite option.  It does not pretend to be anything it isn't and is a very good choice for those wishing to stay near the beach.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4
Pestana Viking,shopping884,74,shopping884wrote a review Aug 2023,"Just recently back from our holiday In Portugal.We stayed along with other family members at the Pestana Viking.Check in seemed to be a bit long winded - all very polite and welcoming but after a 5 hour delay to our flight we just wanted to get checked in and freshen up.The room was clean and tidy but the bathroom did need a bit of TLC in terms of repair and decor - it looked a bit outdated . It wasn’t bad by any means but this along with some other areas of the hotel just need a bit of refurbishment given it is rated a 4 star.The chose the half board option - both breakfast and evening dinner were buffet style offerings - I’m pleased to say I found both to be very good with plenty of choice on offer.The staff worked tirelessly topping it up as well as being very attentive in the dining area - I really must compliment them on how they interacted with our two young grandchildren - nothing was too much trouble for them.The same could be said when our son, his wife, who had got married at another hotel on the Algarve joined us one evening as well as other family. They brought wedding cake to share and the staff provided plates and cutlery for everyone.Most impressed with this.The hotel is well appointed with both indoor and outdoor pools, gym, steam room etc as well as a kids zone.There are other bars and places to eat locally. There is a small shop about 5 minutes walk away but a larger supermarket is about a 15 minute walk.Beaches, you will need to negotiate steps and hills but for most people this is quite manageable - less so for anyone with any mobility issues.To conclude, very happy with our stay but the hotel could do with a bit of a minor uplift away from front of house.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Mary M,2,Mary Mwrote a review Mar 2023,"I have to admit I was nervous before travelling as I had read a few bad reviews only after I had made the booking.  We stayed for 5 nights all inclusive and at a very good price.Firstly we arrived in reception and were dealt with by a lovely gentleman (sorry didnt get his name but he was very friendly and helpful) he got us checked in and even though our room was not ready (arrived around 12.30pm) he told us to go to the restaurant and enjoy some lunch and our room should be ready around 2pm.  We had a lovely lunch and our room was ready at 2pm.  We were shown to our room by the lovely Bruno, he was so nice and carried our bags etc, very polite and a great asset to the place.  Our room was small and basic but very clean and had everything we needed and we had the perfect sea view, we could actually lie in bed and listen to and watch the waves roll in on the beautiful beach below.  We really could not complain about the room, service or food especially with what we paid, it was very good value.  The restaurant staff were so nice and friendly especially one lady who was particularly kind to me when I needed something that was not normally available at the time, I do not know her name (wearing pink shirt and dark sleek ponytail) but she was a credit to the place and very professional.If I was to pick any negatives I would say it would be that the place is a little tired in places but did note that there seems to be a lot of work going on to improve this, covid probably did not help with places like this and things were let slip a bit.  It is a pity that the Ocean Bar is not presented in a nicer way - it has so much potential with the fabulous views and the sound of the sea but it really is so tired looking, the flooring is all mismatched and furniture mixed and just not the most pleasant place to sit but it should be as it is the perfect location.In relation to the poor reviews that stated they could not sleep with the noise at night I can honestly say we never heard a thing at night except the beautiful sound of the waves.All in all we had a lovely stay here and am struggling to understand the very poor reviews.  Good value for money - I would return.",Mar,2023,Mar 2023,2023-03-01,2023,2

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Antxl,65,Antxlwrote a review Jul 2018,"This may be our favourite hotel from staying at dozens around the world!We stayed here 16 June to 30 June 2018. We were originally supposed to stay at the Tivoli Marina hotel, which is a few minutes walk away from this hotel. However, our travel agent e-mailed days before we departed to advise construction work was ongoing. As such we were allowed to adjust our booking, and we opted to stay at the Crowne Plaza.We made such a great decision opting to move to the Crowne Plaza. Everything was great! Highlights include:Great beds and view from the room. We elected a Vilamoura facing Deluxe room and were really pleased with it. Complimentary bottles of water were provided every day. Coffee making facilities are available too, but we requested and were quickly provided with a kettle to make tea. The bathroom was modern and good shower, and all other stuff you'd expect with a five star hotel was in place (robes, slippers, plenty of towels).Breakfast was included and there was plenty of choices. We skipped it a few times as we preferred a longer sleep, but went most mornings and I don't think I had the same breakfast twice. The omelettes were particularly nice and made to order per your request.We used room service a couple of nights after a long day of shopping in Faro and attending the Quarteira saints festival. The food arrived 25 mins later, as advised when ordered, and was great restaurant quality. Portions were also overly generous! Probably the best room service I've had in Europe and North America.Nice bar area that never felt too crowded, with plenty of screens for those that wanted to watch sport like golf, tennis, or world cup football. Also easy to find a quieter spot. Staff were attentive and took and delivered drinks orders to your table.The hotel grounds are equally nice and spacious. We didn't go to the pool often, maybe 3 times, but always managed to get sunbeds. There's also sunbeds available at the garden area away from the pool. The grounds are very well maintained.The gym is open 24/7 with plenty of towels. We planned to use the inside pool and facilities but didn't get round to it. Looked great from a passing perspective though.The marina is a very short walk away, and there's a couple of routes. Neither take too long. This is where the bulk of restaurants, bars and ice cream parlours are. The Family Golf is also a reasonable walk, and great day out. The bus stop to visit Albufeira and Faro is a few minutes away outside the casino, which is next to the hotel. Very easy to travel around from this hotel, and taxis are also reasonably priced.At the end of the street at the main road there's a Spar supermarket, which is great for picking up random bits and pieces.I'd definitely stay again. And most likely will before long! We got really luckySpecial mentions to:Fantastic check in and out with Mario. He provided lots of useful tips that helped us throughout our stay.Miguel helped us with every step of mapping out an excursion, really helpful.Andre was a really friendly barman, and even acted as a photographer on our last night after fixing us some great (albeit non-alcoholic!) cocktails.One point to note was one of our party tripped at night on/near the hotel grounds. There's a path that takes you from the main road to the hotel via the hotel next door. I'm not sure who owns the land, could be either hotel or the local authority, but more lighting and improvement works to level the paving would be useful.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,5
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,DerSin9,29,DerSin9wrote a review Nov 2015,"Stayed here the last week of October 3 adults and 1 child. Reception staff and bar staff excellent, friendly and very helpful with anything we requested.Great choice at breakfast as mentioned many times before but the staff at the end of a long summer season appeared to be suffering from \"tourist fatigue\" and we're as friendly as their other colleagues. Whatever you do don't help yourself to coffee, your pot is brought to the table (would like hot coffee)Rooms were excellent spotlessly clean and spacious, the quirky bathroom \"window\" was a big hit with our 6 yr old. We had a side sea view and a view of Quarteria overlooking the hotel courtyard.Excellent wifi all over the hotel.Pool towels provided daily as you'd expect in a 5*.Disappointed with the indoor pool having a fee but we knew that before we arrived and the good weather meant we got to the beach every day so it wasn't an issue.Good location about 10 mins stroll from the Marina with plenty of places to eat and drink.Overall a great holiday, not sure it warrants a 5* just a couple of little things missing. Free access to the indoor pool and friendlier breakfast staff (not all were unfriendly).Wouldn't have any problem recommending this hotel to anyone.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4

Delivers comfort every time even though this complex is now very dated and there are newer more modern places around. Good value for money although more expensive this October as a lot of people have got wind of the good weather in the Algarve well into October. Will be back next year as usual.

São Lourenço do Barrocal,Dinesh J,57,Dinesh Jwrote a review Aug 2023,"During a recent trip to Portugal, we made an impromptu decision to check out this hotel as some friends had heard that it was very nice.Being a member of The Leading Hotels of the World, I decided to check on their web site but surprisingly it showed no vacancy so I tried browsing directly on the hotel's home page and it showed various categories of rooms available. We were a group of 4 and we needed two rooms. We could not make up our mind as to which category room to book out of the three types of options that was available for the two days stay. We decided to call the hotel up and inform them that we were in need of two rooms and that we would be driving down from Lisbon which would take approx 2 hours. They told us it was perfectly fine.We reached the hotel at around 2 pm and Mr. Rui (with whom we had spoken on the phone) arranged for us to see the 3 types of rooms and we opted the middle category. As we had not had lunch, we straight away went to their restaurant and were pleasantly surprised with the level of service and also the quality of freshness in the food. Since all four of us are vegetarians, we also asked the server if we could speak to the chef so that he could perhaps cook us some pasta and other things for the dinner that evening. Here again they were very accommodating and the chef had arranged very delicious and fresh food for dinner.The rooms are very rustic and yet very elegant. The bathroom sizes were very big and the room type we chose had a small terrace area at the back with table and seating.All through our stay, we all felt that the service level was excellent and everyone had a pleasant smile and amazing and warm attitude. The housekeeping ensured that the rooms were serviced properly and kept in great condition.We were also very happy with the variety of the spread at breakfast. The quality of the bakery items was top notch.Frankly speaking, at first, I was a little sceptical to stay at this property as it literally seems like its away from civilisation but we all were taken aback at the quality of service and also the variety of food and beverage options.The reception team assisted us with booking a hot air balloon ride and whenever we would contact them by WhatsApp, the response was very swift. My wife had accidentally dropped her eyeglasses in the balloon basket which the people at the hotel very kindly arranged to send to a local friend in Lisbon.I suppose there were only two minor let downs for us. On the second evening of our stay, we decided to try their outdoor barbecue dinner. While we were assured that there would be a fair bit of variety for vegetarians, it was somehow not very fulfilling. The other let down was that the hotel told me that I was not entitled to get any points for the stay since the booking was not done through the Leading Hotels of The World web site. I clarified to them that the web site was clearly showing us no vacancy so I could not make the booking through that site. They finally discussed with them and gave me 50% of the due points. Barring these minor issues, I would say that I will gladly want to go back to stay at this amazingly friendly and beautiful hotel whenever I am next in Portugal. Definitely among one of our most memorable hotel stays.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Suki Kaur,0,Suki Kaurwrote a review Jul 2019,"1. On arrival, there was no provision for dinner, even for the 2 year old with us. We arrived before dinner ended at 9.30pm but had to queue for over an hour just to sort out our rooms.2. Terribly disorganised reception - we booked our rooms 2 months in advance but still all 6 rooms were scattered throughout the massive complex. One person requested a ground floor room in advance as she was disabled but was advised she could not have one.3. We had to walk several hundred metres up hills and steps just to get from our room to reception and to any facilities e.g. the restaurant.4. Staff were rude at the reception, there was no service with a smile there!5. On the day of check-out, we were asked several times to empty our rooms even though we had paid extra to keep them until 6pm.5. The WORST thing was the food, there was very little variety, and I'm sure some was re-heated or re-used for more than one meal. Proof of this was after one particular lunch, 5 out of 10 of our guests were in bed within 6 hours with vomiting and diarrhoea. Our toddler was very unwell for a week even after returning to the UK and had to be admitted to hospital for IV fluids.6. Generally very noisy day and night.

The Stream Room broke down but the Sauna was good.The staff were all really friend and helpful but I on criticism would be the slow service around pool area bar during the day.

The staff guided us around and if you had any queries they would attend immediatelyWhen we were leaving, the hotel arranged taxi, which only cost 15 euros to the airport (cheap!!!)Location:The hotel is about 15-20 minutes away from the airportThe hotel is situated 3 minutes walk from the metro, (marques de pombal) so very useful if you want to see many of at attractions of lisbonBeing situated at the centre of lisbon, there are plenty of restaurants and takeways few minutes walk from the hotel. They have got mcdonalds opposite the hotel, which is very handyWhen you leave the hotel, turn left and walk down the street you will see a supermarket (really cheap to buy the basics - we realized on the last day though)Rooms:The rooms are very large and quite clean. The beds were comfortable so had no problem. The rooms had balcony but we were given the front rooms (where the view was not all that (street view) but that didnt bother us)The kitchen had all the basics (mircowave, cooker, fridge, plates, cups etc) but do bring some fairly liquid and sponge.Had a plasma in our room and used the safe (middle of wardrobe)A cleaner would come every day in the morning to clean the sheet and provide new towels. The shower was clean and had all the essentials.At the back there is a swimming pool (didnt swim) but did soak some sun - in the evening would come back to hotel and just relaxWe never tried the food at the hotel so cannot commentOn the whole the hotel was amazing - felt like at home.

We arrived around 11.30 and was made aware the check in time to the hotel is normally 3pm, which was fine with us as it meant we could use the pool after being on the plane. The reception staff we very friendly and kept our luggage safe.The location of the hotel itself is very breathtaking. The chapel located at the end of the hotel is also worth a visit but may be challenging to walk to, for those with mobility issues as its located on a hill. The local cuisine and town is very nice with good options for food and drink.The pool and bar area featured some delicious food and drinks, and the service was very good especially from Ruben who worked at the bar area.The outside pools were very nice, only drawback were they were very cold. Given the time of year, they could have done with being alot warmer. The indoor spa pool was heated  to a comfy temperature, and the jacuzzi and other facilities such as the sauna were also very warm. The only drawback is the spa could do with an update, it is showing its age and is quite run down with bits of flaking paint present in the jacuzzi.The food at the restaurant was very nice, and had a different dish each night. The fish pie and vegetarian lasagne are very nice and worth a try! Good selection of different food each night and a good variety for breakfast.We had a suite with a sea view. The room was very clean, and had good facilties such as a microwave, oven and washing facilties. They also provided us with two wine glasses. The only thing that could be improved is some cutlery could be provided in the draw.There was plenty of space in the room itself and in the wardrobe, the bed was comfortable but the duvet was slightly itchy (but I do have sensitive skin). Overall, the suite was very nice and spacious.I was very happy with my stay at this hotel and would visit again. I'd also like to mention how fantastic the staff are, they left a birthday cake for me with a lovley message in my room on my actual birthday. I felt very appreciative of this as I hadn't mentioned it was my birthday, and this made me feel welcomed.Would like to thank the staff for a lovley stay and myself and my partner will be returning again!",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,4

Hilton Porto Gaia,Moonshadow,0,Moonshadowwrote a review Jun 2024,"A disappointing stay. The hotel is in its 3rd year of operations so we assumed things should be at the optimum level. No. We stayed there for 6 nights.1. Lack of amenities and basically no refill, even for toilet paper, box tissue and complimentary water. We had to call the front desk to refill the stuff everything things were used up.2. Room service. Very limited choice aside, staff also forgot the basic stuff. Meal for 2 persons was given just a set of utensils, no plate. We ordered iced lemon tea which came in a bottle but without a bottle opener. We waited for 15 minutes before the bottle opener was brought to hs.  That was not a single incidence and it happened to two of our meals.3. Food quality. We had buffet breakfast for six consecutive days at the hotel and surprisingly there’s NO change to the breakfast options. The hotel was serving literally the same food everyday. Was expecting at least one or two local food options like egg tart but none.  Very limited food options. On our 2nd last day my hubby sensed that the food was not fresh enough and he’s right. Immediately after breakfast he had diarrhea for two whole days….4. Hardware. It looks nice on the outside but the toilet door on the ground floor was broken and couldn’t be closed.In short, a disappointing stay.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,2

The hotel is value for money, rooms are spacious if bland and bathrooms are somewhat tired. But it has ridiculously small public areas for a hotel of this size. There are three lifts but they are of the tiny, only four or five people at a time size which doesn't work for a big, busy hotel like this. And breakfast management was hilariously incompetent. We had to queue before we could enter the breakfast room (like wait for ten minutes) which was odd because, although the breakfast room is way too small for a hotel of this size, there were always obviously empty tables. And the staff didn't really help by allocating a table for six to two elderly English ladies while pushing three smaller tables together for a smaller family of five. We were also woken twice by the cleaning lady who was doing the room next door but left the door open and broke off to have shrieked conversations on her mobile phone. So, in sum, an unremarkable but well-located hotel that is value for money at its current rates but there are probably better options in the wonderful city that is Lisbon.",Sep,2013,Sep 2013,2013-09-01,2013,3

Don't make Sintra a day trip--definitely go there and stay there!  This B&B is just one one-bedroom apartment.  It's incredible and I can't say enough good stuff about it.The owner, Carole, is just lovely and adds all sorts of little touches to make it feel like a place you want to stay in...she provides fresh bars of soap, a new sponge, and a spotless apartment.  this may sound like little things, but it makes you feel at home.  She provides breakfast--by leaving fresh fruit, breads, and plenty of eggs, juices, milk and coffee.  I like that it wasn't \"Please come sit down at this time and you'll eat what i prepare.\"The location is qonderful--it's a five minute walk (at most) from the downtown area of Sintra.  We were in heaven when we realized JUST how close everything was.The garden is large and amazingly beautiful.  There is a terrace (with table and chairs) that overlook the valley--where we ate all of our meals.  Since we have two small children who went to bed early, we would get take out from nice restaurants and eat our dinners out there.  It was heavenly.Carole is very nice and so accomodating.  She gave us tons of suggestions and even helped us out (keeping our baby in safe arms and playing with our daughter) as we were packing up.  I can't say enough nice things about her.She has a lovely pool--prob the ONLY downside to the trip is that the water was too cold to swim--but she said she's soon putting in a heater.

Although the hotel is only 2 star I think this is because of the lack of a safe in the rooms and possibly other amenities but what it lacks for on some aspects it certainly makes up for in others.  Indeed I have been in  much worse so called 4 star hotels.  I would certainly recommend this hotel and we are staying again on our return trip in a couple of weeks.  We are on the 4th floor and even though it is very near to the main road there is very little noise as there is such good soundproofing.
