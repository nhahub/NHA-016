Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,alfred901,0,alfred901wrote a review Aug 2023,We had a lovely time overall in the hotel. The staff were very friendly and kind. The entertainment At night was not very good. The rooms were not cleaned to a high standard and one bottle of water in the room was not sufficient. Normally we would receive fresh water each day in our rooms. Over all the stay was a very pleasant one. Again I have to say the staff were really nice. Especially in the Al bar,Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4

Superb buffet breakfast with an opportunity to enjoy the views outside. I had a spacious bedroom with a large bathroom, balcony and views towards the pool and sea.

Saccharum,chris s,110,chris swrote a review May 2016,"Just come back from a Madeira break. This hotel was a little far out from the main places there but that really works to enhance its appeal. The hotel is as close to the beach as you could ever want and is beautifully set into the bay. The rooms are fab and along with a top notch bed (always my priority) were clean, well appointed and spacious. The staff were really friendly and helpful and the food (we were there on a half board basis) was great. All in all I am puzzled. We have stayed in several 5 star rated hotels not this good so why is this hotel rated 4 stars?? It's seclusion was never a problem as road networks are good but I loved the peace it brought. Thanks to all there for helping making this a holiday to remember for all the right reasons.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Louise S,26,Louise Swrote a review Jun 2016,"Me and my partner stayed here at the end of May/start of August (aged 24 and 26)This hotel is absolutely stunning and spotless! Rooms were perfect, staff were so friendly and helpful. I particularly loved the pool area (apart from pool bar closing at random times each day). We stayed for 1 week all inclusive. I would stay here again but definitely NOT all inclusive, but on a self catering basis. The only let down for us was the food. I usually ignore bad reviews on food as im not a fussy eater but the food was terrible. There was a ridiculously small amount of food to choose from and to be honest what they did have out usually could not be put together as a meal. Also the standard of the food was terrible for a 5star hotel. I have stayed in a 3 star hotel with much better quality of food. If it was not for this I would have given this hotel a 5.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,3

1e Carvoeiro,shensa,10,shensawrote a review May 2019,We visited during Easter. We were 5 staying in a 2 Bedroom apartment. It was road facing just across the reception. Everything in the apartment was neat and lovely. We had asked for a hamper that was provided. The reception staff was courteous and very helpful. They helped us choose local tours and gave whatever information we needed. There was nothing negative about the apartment except the sofa bed which folded on itself when lying down. Happened during sleep so it was a pain trying to correct it. The restaurants in the resort were ok foodwise and price wise. The village was a brief walk away. However it was a slope so one had to climb up. Manageable unless mobility is restricted. The place overall is beautiful and quiet and far better than the  other bustling towns of Algarve.,May,2019,May 2019,2019-05-01,2019,4

I highly recommend the airport transfer, after you get your luggage the driver is waiting there with your name and within 30 min you are at the apartment and Rui was waiting for us.   Rui arranged restaurant reservations and booked our tours that were just perfect. The Douro valley tour was the highlight. The owners genuinely care about Porto and give you lots of information.  With the WhatsApp they are never far away to help in any way.  We had the 2 bedroom apartment that was spacious, clean and beautiful.  The bathroom is gorgeous.

Room service was good, bit on the expensive side but the food was excellent!This is an excellent hotel for business people or guests only staying for one night. Not great for sightseeing as you are not within walking distance to the old part of Lisbon which is where you will find the major historical sights. You would have to cross big roads to get to public transport. Unless you use taxi's.

If you are driving through beautiful, rural eastern Portugal, this is a must stop.  The Casa Pinto is small but totally charming.  It was the most unique accommodation of our three weeks in Portugal.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The views of the town and the surrounding countryside from the B&B or one of the lovely restaurants is spectacular.  Casa Pinto and Monsaraz are must visits.

Vila Galé Albacora,Fififlores,28,Fififloreswrote a review Apr 2008,"This hotel is beautifully located, in the ´marismas´ (totally undeveloped salt marshes, filled with birds) opposite Tavira island - while it feels quite far from Tavira town itself, as you follow a windy road around salt flats to get there, it´s right by the little dock where you catch the boat to Tavira island.We stayed in a room without a view (a little terrace looking onto the car park), which was fine - reasonable size, even with the travel cot provided and assembled by the hotel (no extra charge). Good food - decent buffet (fresh crab and chocolate fondue, not together obviously) and lots of fresh fruit too. Nice terrace overlooking the pool. Charmless bar with fairly uncringeworthy music, unavoidable as loudspeakered into the dining room, and a rather fine strawberry daiquiri. Kids´ playground and lovely sea walks with a decent beach nearby, with little rivulets, perfect for crab hunting and general kiddy pottering.Only real complaint was that they charged us to use the indoor pool - outrageous - 7.50 euros each, plus swimming hat on top of that. Reception staff were totally unapologetic and rude about this, though pool staff were delightful. I thought that charging to use a hotel facility was very very cheeky, in a four-star hotel. The (free) outdoor pool is lovely for those visiting in warmer weather.",Apr,2008,Apr 2008,2008-04-01,2008,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,stone_galen,8,stone_galenwrote a review Jul 2017,"I needed a good room for a week of conference attendance. The hotel asked me either to pay in advance (no refund policy) or to pay a higher rate. I paid in advance. During check in, I still had to produce my credit carda and sign legal documents giving Marriot access rights to my account. No hotel should ask for pre payment AND security. It gives your customers the feeling that you rate them as bums. -- For guests with cars, the location is great, because the next motorway is around the corner. For guests who wish to enjoy their balcony or the pool, sound protectors are advised. Also, if you don't fancy very long walks in the summer heat, you need to pay for many taxi rides (fares are cheap, compared with London or Paris). -- In my room, the WiFi didn't work, even despite lengthy conversations with service persons. The hotel policy of making guests pay extra for (a) ordinary internet use and (b) highspeed uses results in a highly dysfunctional WiFi.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

Royal Savoy Hotel,Allycheck,43,Allycheckwrote a review Jun 2016,I visit here every 2 years and was impressed this year with the obvious redecoration that has been going on.  Mind you - restaining the decking and waiting for at least 4 days for it to dry was a bit OTT.  We were going to eat in the hotel this time around but the Madeira buffet seems to have disappeared so we went out.  As stated before drinks prices are way too expensive and we go up to the Number Two Pub up the hill.  We also tried lunch at the pool bar - not a good idea - service was very slow and my beefburger had gristle in it.  But everything else was lovely and the staff as always very helpful especially the lovely sun lounger and umbrella man and the gorgeous Bulgaria hawk.,Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Mark R,14,Mark Rwrote a review Dec 2019,"We had planned to visit Reid's for afternoon tea by pre-booking to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.The Hotel is very grand and kept very well.Unfortunately for our visit the terrace was closed due to work being undertaken and we were shown to a very nice table in the William Room by the most polite staff.  It was a good deal warmer than sitting on the terrace as we were behind glass windows, but still with a lovely view of Funchal Bay.We cannot recommend the service highly enough, particularly as we were offered a complementary glass of bubbly due to the inconvenience- you could hear works noise being carried out nearby.The selection of sandwiches was lovely and the staff kept them coming according to our preference of filling.  The Scones are to die for - still warm and soft inside with lovely local jam and clotted cream.  The individual cakes were plentiful and of a very high patisserie standard.A good  selection of teas served in Wedgewood china service - nothing was too much for the staff to replenish either food or drink.We didn't realise actually how much we had eaten that afternoon until we stood up to leave we were very very full!We would really have liked a stroll in the hotel gardens, as they looked magnificent and just right to walk off the food.  However, these were only for residents use.A fantastic experience overall despite the inconvenience - well recommended and worthy of the cost for the standard of service, food and general experience.",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,3

Close to Funchal - a 15 minute walk to centre and harbour - easy journey from airport.The staff were attentive and responsive  - and the room and facilities well maintained.  Breakfast was taken by the pool area (choice of both indoors and outdoors)  and always a good selection - with main offerings purposely cooked so very fresh and appetising.  The dinners were taken in a selection of the 4 restaurants - the 2 speciality restaurants were great - as was the seaside terrace - but the bar terrace menu was a tad “same every night”Both pool swimming and sea swimming was available - the sea is accessed via a short ladder and vey deep water but a nice swim to the sea raft - and fully lifeguard attended.Loungers galore - never a problem finding a pair in full sun or shade.Easy to recommend - would return,Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,4

The concierge was helpful in booking activities.Cons: the “classic” rooms which are the most basic are far too small and awkward - to pass between one side of the room to another, we had to squeeze between a desk and a corner of the bed, so perhaps a a foot in width. At the prices for the rooms which are themselves a bit dated if clean, they should be better laid out.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Cfcsccc,108,Cfcscccwrote a review Jan 2018,We stayed for a week arriving New Years Eve having stayed years ago when it was The Atlantis Hotel and again in 2010 when it had just been refurbished as the Crown PlazaI booked a superior room and requested a higher floor but on arrival I noticed we were only on the 3rd floor. I asked for a higher room to be told we had been upgraded to a deluxe room. I should have pushed harder as the superior and deluxe rooms are no different except superior overlook Quarteira and deluxe Vilamoura - Note unless you are keen to be on the Vilamoura side do not pay the extra that the room rate charges for Deluxe - From our room we overlooked the casino car park and buildings - I can see that from the upper floor you maybe able to see the marina.Staff were very friendly and always welcomed with a greeting and a smile. We had breakfast included and it was super with a very wide range from cooked to continental fruit pastrys etc.Room was comfortable with a very large bed and great bathroom. The room does not have a kettle only an nexpresso machine and they charge €2 for additional capsules - We took box of 10 from our supermarket with us costing only £2.50Another gripe is that they have a spa and whilst they charge for treatments they also charge €11 per day for use of the indoor pool. This in my mind is unacceptable for a so called 5 star hotel particularly in the close season when the outdoor pool is not usable.Would I stay again - Yes but only if I could get a good rate.,Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,2

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Kerry O,133,Kerry Owrote a review Mar 2013,"Just got back from a group trip to Villa Gale Tavira. Firstly, Tavira town has bags of character and charm. Cobbled streets, squares and gardens with lots of very reasonably priced cafes. Free wi-fi across the town centre - altogether a really lovely little town. The hotel is a very short walk from the town centre - but if you want the beach - that's another story as it's a bit of a journey to get there. ( Though well worth it - its a lovely stretch of sand). The hotel itself is good - well run and similar to other hotels in the chain. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Wi fi is free in the lobby and bar but chargeable if you want it in your room. Safe keys for your room are also charged for. The indoor pool and spa were very nice and well used. The food is a bit of a let-down - who wants to see 'stewed chicken' on a menu ? The buffet does tend to be chicken /fish/ pork every night and it 's a bit indifferent although there is plenty of fresh salad and fruit if you are happy with that. Altogether a good hotel.",Mar,2013,Mar 2013,2013-03-01,2013,4
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Shalinee,1,Shalineewrote a review Nov 2021,"My husband, 7 year old kid and I were there the last week of October. We checked into a deluxe double bedroom apartment.That first morning when we arrived into the room, we found the hotel grounds, swimming pools and our room balcony view absolutely stunning! The apartment was clean, kitchen well stocked, bed comfortable, all in all an excellent experience. The breakfast had a large choice, I especially liked the variety of freshly cooked hot food. The beach right in front of the hotel is a long stretch with sandy beaches, plenty of restaurants and other shops to keep busy. The entertainment provided in the evenings in the hotel was also excellent! A delightful experience, no problems faced, we are absolutely returning to this hotel!",Nov,2021,Nov 2021,2021-11-01,2021,5

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Neilston_Travellers,9,Neilston_Travellerswrote a review Oct 2007,"My husband and I stayed at the Vila Gale Tavira in May this year and I must admit I am surprised by the reviews I have read recently.  The hotel is clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, the buffet breakfast had something for everyone, the room we had was on the ground floor and was fairly spacious and quiet,The hotel is well appointed for everything in Tavira.  Tavira itself is a working town not just a holiday resort, therefore if you are looking for all the usual English pubs, clubs etc., you won't find them here.  Having stayed in other parts of the Algarve we preferred Tavira because it was more Portuguese than other built up areas.With regard to restaurants we felt spoilt for choice.  We would advise a visit to the Bar Romba at lunch time.  You have to be quick as it fills up fast with local business people.  The fish dishes are wonderful and exceptionally well priced.  We would also advise trying the Joao Belhi, Beira Rio and the Brisa do Rio all were excellent particularly the fish dishes.  We would advise you to avoid the Chinese restaurant and the restaurants along the river (at the ferry point) offering discounts.Regarding things to do in Tavira - a visit to the obseratory is well worthwhile and the trip to Tavira Island is well worth it.  We walked the mile or so from the Vila Gale to the ferry point but public transport is also available.  The beach is really spectacular.  We also took the train from Tavira to Monte Gordo which was also well worth the trip.All in all we had an excellent week in a reasonable hotel.",Oct,2007,Oct 2007,2007-10-01,2007,4
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,thomasholmes5,7,thomasholmes5wrote a review Apr 2022,"Location is great right on the beach. We were early for booking in and expected to have to wait but the reception staff, who are really friendly and helpful made a few phone calls and booked us in straightaway and a young man carried our luggage and showed us to our apartment. We booked a deluxe one bedroom apartment and we were really pleased with the accomodation which had everything we needed. The cleanliness of the hotel swimming pools and grounds are a credit to the hotel. The maid who cleaned our room was really nice and came almost every other day. The towels were changed regularly and were of a good quality as were the bed sheets which the maid changed and all were really nice and clean. We also had a great balcony and view. There are restaurants and bars close by. The bus stop is just on the main road right outside the hotel and only costs 1 euro 40 cents. We used to walk along the main road and down past the Monica Isabela hotel down to the beach and walk into Albufeira. There are two good supermarkets close by, Inter Marche a five minute walk away and an Aldi about ten minutes walk away. We have only been home about two weeks but we have booked our next holiday here.",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,4

Hotel Albergaria Dias,pinooke,2,pinookewrote a review Nov 2009,My husband and I visted this hotel last july. On arrival we were greeted by Mr Diaz junior.  His first question was if we had breakfast and since we didn't have any we could have some in the breakfast room eventhough breakfast was over. We could have anything we wanted. He promised us that our room would be ready within an hour. And indeed he kept his promise. The rooms are clean and big enough.The staff is very friendly and will help you with anything you need.Breakfast is simple but delisious. Restaurants are 2 minutes walking and good.The swimming pool was wonderfull and there where some days I had it just to myself.Mr Diaz senoir took us in his own car into the hills to buy a typical maderia souvenier. He just offered us to take us there and on our way back he took us sight seeing to some beautifull spots near Funchal.This hotel is located away from the hotel zone and it is a nice and quiet surronding... no carsTo any one who likes peace and quiet and good service this is the place to be... we will be back to this hotel soon,Nov,2009,Nov 2009,2009-11-01,2009,5

Legendary Lisboa Suites,Justus5NY,101,Justus5NYwrote a review Dec 2011,"The best part of staying at this aparthotel is that the rooms are unusually large for Europe. We were in a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom unit. There was a full size fold out couch in the living room, which was  opened and made up when we checked in. There is a dining table and service for 5. The kitchenette was \"bare bones\", with just a mini-fridge, microwave and 2 burners. The pool and surrounding area were clean and well-kept. There is a small restaurant, but we did not eat there.It appears at first blush that the hotel is very far off the beaten path. But actually being on a side street means that it is pretty quiet at night. You can catch the train just about a block away--walk UP the hill to the station rather than down. It's much closer. You can catch the hop on-hop off bus Marquis de Pombal plaza which is a short walk away.There's a small grocery store across the main road. It's perfect to stock the kitchen for breakfast and snacks. Make a left out of the hotel, and then a left and go half a block to a tiny restaurant (mid-block) which has terrific food at really reasonable prices.There is a McDonald's right across from the hotel.The staff at the front desk was a \"mixed bag.\" Some quite willing to make conversation and assist with plans and suggestions, others not so much. Overall, this was an excellent stay at a reasonable, spacious hotel.",Dec,2011,Dec 2011,2011-12-01,2011,4

The location is excellent, Belem is a very nice part of Lisbon. The open top tour bus stops just outside and is convenient for hopping on and getting an overview of the main sites. The pool area is very cool and hip, the rooms are big (we stayed in a superior with balcony) beds are very comfortable. The bar area is very funky with great cocktails perfect for a starter drink.We ate in the hotel on the 1st night the food was excellent with a gorgeous selection of wine all well priced. I would highly recommend this hotel for a base in lisbon.",Jul,2010,Jul 2010,2010-07-01,2010,5
Quinta do Morgado - Monte da Eira Apartments,Neil576,147,Neil576wrote a review Jul 2018,"We stayed for the one night prior to checking into a villa in Altura. We received a very warm welcome and they accommodated an earlier check in time. They provided a very helpful map of the local area and directions to locate the apartment. The accommodation was on the second floor where we enjoyed a two bedroom/two bathroom apartment. The air conditioning worked perfectly and it was spotlessly clean. Access to the second floor for anyone with mobility needs may be difficult as there were a lot of stairs. Large balcony overlooking the pool. No designated parking but plenty on the road below the apartment block. It was quiet and felt very safe. Tennis court and pool very close by as well as a restaurant and bar. WiFi is chargeable and not particularly cheap but it worked well at a good speed. Excellent, helpful and accommodating staff, easy to find, very clean and well equipped accommodation and very close to beautiful Tavira town centre. Good access to the airport as well. Would certainly use again.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,4
Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,KatieR,27,KatieRwrote a review Jan 2013,"Gorgeous views, fabulous rooms, perfect service from serene, welcoming staff,great location--what more can you ask for from a hotel?  We arrived drooping from an overseas flight and hassling at the airport with lost luggage to an oasis of kindness.  Theresa, the front office  desk manager, took one look at us and had our room prepared immediately even though we had arrived at 10:30am.  While we waited, other front desk staff assured us that they would send our luggage up to our room as soon as it arrived and settled us in comfy chairs overlooking the Tagus River to await our bed.Our huge second floor room overlooked the marina, the Tagus River and the landmark Belem Tower.  Waiting on the table when we arrived were four of the national pastries, Pastais de Belem, which would become an addiction for us during our stay in Portgual.  The room had every amenity you could ask for including charging outlets on the desk for our electronics and genuinely comfortable chair and chaise for reading and planning.After a long nap, we wandered down to Reception and inquired about a simple Portuguese restaurant.  After getting a feel for what we might like, the young man made the reservation for us, called a cab for us and when it arrived, escorted us to the cab telling the driver exactly where to take us.  This is a priceless service to those still reeling from overseas travel!  His recommendation turned out to be one of our favorite restaurants in Lisbon.  There is no need for a separate concierge because every front desk staffer is a knowledgeable, multi-lingual problem-solver.  When we needed to ship an item back home, the first person I asked at the desk immediately found the name of the company they use, called with detailed instructions for picking up my item and then provided me with all the written information I would need to track my shipment.  The company they connected me with was extremely helpful when we ran into a technical glitch and my item made it to the US exactly as promised.  None of this would have been possible without the help of the Altis Belem and, as with every inquiry, everything was effortless.The next morning we made our way down to the lovely breakfast room with tables both indoors and outside for our inclusive breakfast.  We gave our room number to Natalie and from then on we were greeted each morning by her welcoming smile.  She never had to ask our room number again!We had a similar delightful experience in the beautiful bar which again has seating both indoors and outside overlooking the Tagus River. We discovered that the Altis Belem bar had a bottle of the almost-impossible-to-find-in-the-USA Pappy Van Winkle bourbon and thus began an ongoing conversation with Andres.  During quiet moments in the bar, he was extremely generous about sharing information and stories about his country which enormously enhanced our visit.  When we told him where we were headed the next day, he would suggest certain sights not to miss and the best route to take and he was always absolutely right.We had only planned to stay three nights in Lisbon but we extended our stay one night because we just weren't ready to leave this perfect hotel and we returned for two more nights two weeks later in our trip just to make sure we hadn't dreamed how wonderful it was.  It MADE our first trip ever to Portugal.",Jan,2013,Jan 2013,2013-01-01,2013,5

HF Fenix Lisboa,coshaw,54,coshawwrote a review Aug 2015,"The hotel was easy to find on the side of one of Lisbon's great landmarks, the car park was less easy to find but one extra turn around the round about solved the problem.  The staff were very friendly and the lobby bar and lounge were very comfortable.  The lifts were small but surprisingly efficient.  The rooms and bathrooms were good sized clean and comfortable.  Taking the lift to the basement breakfast room was a surprise - instead of a small dark room there was a very large and grand room with natural lighting provide via a garden atrium.  The hotel while appearing to be a little out of the city centre was actually at the top of a grand avenue which runs all the way through the city centre down to the harbour on the river - an easy 20 minutes walk.  If you prefer buses run from across the roundabout and the terminal for all the hop-on-hop-off tourist buses is on an adjacent side of the square.  Our room facing the large square and roundabout had its own spacious balcony with a couple of deck chairs which captured the sun throughout the day.  For our first trip to Lisbon a great choice.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,4
Myriad By Sana,Fatima T,14,Fatima Twrote a review Aug 2018,"Stayed there on recent visit with my family (including two boys). They have a small \"kids room\" with the most amazing and helpful staff that gave us some great insights into things to do with kids.  The hotel is quite modern and the morning breakfast is so well worth it with some of the most spectacular views of the Tagus. It's quite close to the airport (and should cost no more than 10euros - beware of taxis that over charge) so it made making our early morning flight a breeze. It is however, a 15minute drive to the center of Lisbon or you can take the metro to get to the center quite easily (will take a bit longer).  This hotel is great for runners, as i took long runs along the river and there is a lot to do around the area - a few museums and some nice restaurants but not the authentic colorful Lisbon you get when in the center of the city.  If you want peace and quiet and don't mind trekking to the center, this is a beautiful hotel to stay it.  If you want to be in the center of it all and just walk everywhere, I would recommend staying closer to the city center.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4

This is one of them. Although the staff are very friendly and rooms very clean. Beds very lumpy and uncomfortable and air con not the best. Breakfast experience very dull. So after three days we move to an Ibis (red) a few km's away. What a difference. Great place.
