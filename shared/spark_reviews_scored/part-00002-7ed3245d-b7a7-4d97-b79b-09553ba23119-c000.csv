Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,SarahWilsher,3,SarahWilsherwrote a review Oct 2020,"We stayed here for a week starting 3rd October 2020 and we had a lovely holiday! We agree with other reviews that there is a few things missing that make this hotel 5* but we still enjoyed our stay. We feel it was worth the money we paid. The major downside was the cold pools, our baby loves the water but he just screamed every time we tried to put him in. Also the roof top bar was shut for maintenance which was disappointing. The tea and coffee isn’t replaced in the room room which disappointed us. Also just a little thing but I love a dressing gown and slippers in a hotel room which was also a bit disappointing! However we loved everything else! The food was nice, staff friendly, free shuttle bus which was full so they came back for us which was so kind! I think this hotel is amazing for older children there’s so much going on to keep them entertained. The a la carte restaurant was our favourite part, the food was gorgeous! Overall we would stay here again!",Oct,2020,Oct 2020,2020-10-01,2020,4

Saccharum,Nabiha N,45,Nabiha Nwrote a review Feb 2017,"This hotel has a lot to offer that includes a game room, infinity pool/multiple rooms and spa. We were a little surprised with the open walk-in shower. Just check the room before you book it.  We didn't like the  buffet dinner. The food was below average and there weren't a lot of meat dishes only had duck when we were dining. Dessert counter was acceptable standard. We felt like we got more out of €39 in other places.",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,4

Hotel Madeira,Julie B,2,Julie Bwrote a review Feb 2017,Great central friendly hotel - within walking distance to harbour & restaurants. The hotel is very clean with a great rooftop bar with lovely views. Lots of comments regarding the breakfast - we had no problems there was a good range of both cooked & continental. Our only small disappointment was there was no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room - but that said we would definitely stay again!

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Michelle n,6,Michelle nwrote a review Jun 2025,"Spotless hotel, food good and selection good. Kid clubs great, Staff lovely but have to rate 3 star due to undersupported reception. On average took 10-20 mins to speak with someone on reception about a query or to book restaurant. Waited one day for 35 minutes. Staff trying their best but it gets annoying after a day or two. No one answers phone. They should have a dedicated person for queries or taxi bookings as hold up seemed to happen when people were checking in.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,3
Quinta Mirabela,shererazade,7,shererazadewrote a review Apr 2013,"wonderful location halfway up Monte, great to watch the men in baskets running down the hill! The hotel has regular buses in to Funchal which is great. Wonderful design hotel. My husband and I are probably younger than most visitors to Madeira so looking for an up to date hotel was not easy in the slightest. This hotel ticked all the boxes for us. It was a boutique hotel, the staff were so helpful and utterly charming they could not do enough for you. Wonderful. The food was good, decent selection at breakfast. It was the rooms which was the clincher for us. After staying in hotels that really needed a spruce up, this was such a delight. Wonderfully modern and well designed rooms. We felt right at home. Our room overlooked the bay of Funchal and the sparkling pool, we had a terrace which was lovely to have a drink and watch the boats come in. Absolutely wonderful and we will be back very soon.",Apr,2013,Apr 2013,2013-04-01,2013,5
The Boliqueime Inn Hotel,Sindy7,184,Sindy7wrote a review Sep 2017,"Staying in a villa locally & the owners had rcommended this place for lunch. Portuguese feel to,it tho many of the staff appear to be English. Pre,lunch drinks in a big and airy bar area. The restaurant itself was a disappointment, we were sat at a table butting up to a peeling column of wall, with no feeling of space or view at all. Why do restaurants even have table like that?So, although the food & service were good - lovely prawn & avocado starter, good roast lamb dinner, with all the trimmings & nice puddings, for me the whole experience was spoilt by the poor table.There's a good,chance we will be repeat visitors to this area but not sure if we'll be repeat visitors to this restaurant if the dining room isn't improved.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,2

The resort has top wquality units of good size and well supported by an excelelent service staff who respond immediateley to your needs.

Hotel Madeira,Benedicte A,3,Benedicte Awrote a review Dec 2017,"The room size was okay, but the room itself was so cold that we needed extra blankets and to put a sweater on when we were inside.When we took a shower the whole bathroom flooded and there was no air in the bathroom after, because of bad ventilation.The breakfast felt like it was a week old or prepared in a microwave.The rooftop was really nice, but no one could use the pool because it was’nt heated.",Dec,2017,Dec 2017,2017-12-01,2017,2

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",Patrick J,0,Patrick Jwrote a review Jun 2022,"Booked a week with our three children (all nearly four years old) at Pine Cliffs because we had heard so much about how child friendly it is, and also read reviews confirming as much. Unfortunately I have to say all those reviewers should be drug tested, as they cannot possibly have gone here with kids. This is a beautiful golf resort with a number of excellent pools, that at best tolerates children. Nothing here is designed for kids. The family room had beds three foot high with stone floors: wriggly children falling out of bed will end up dead or with cracked skulls. There is not one plastic plate or tumbler in the apartment: every plate is porcelain; every drink vessel is made of thin glass; every piece of cutlery metal. The restaurants themselves are the same, so as soon as you sit down you are frantically moving all glasses and plates away from the children. Drinks ordered for kids are delivered in fragile glass. The buffet restaurant - a must for parents with one child, as it avoids any unnecessary waiting - is closed two days of the week, and was then closed for another two days of our stay because of a corporate function. This went for other restaurants as well, at one point half of them were closed for various reasons. But most disappointing of all was the fabled Kids Club: it is terrible! Our kids have being going to nursery and camps for the last two years so are game for anything, but within a couple of days were refusing to go because it was so boring. There are barely any toys, kids are shoved into a holding pen with some sand, and end up inside watching movies. It is staffed by disinterested looking local teenagers who seem bewildered when faced with a crying child. We weren’t the only ones, plenty of other couples had a similar experience of kids refusing to go after a few days due to it being so boring.All in all, mega disappointing, especially when it’s spoken of so highly, just cannot believe those reviewers actually have children",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,2

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Caro and C,0,Caro and Cwrote a review Sep 2023,Our room on our first day was so small we couldn't open our suitcases.  For three of the four nights we had no air-conditioning. The room was stifling and if we opened the window loud music from the courtyard filled our room.  The staff were friendly although VERY slow and uncoordinated. Overall a very disappointing experience.,Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,2

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,lizziemLanark,40,lizziemLanarkwrote a review Oct 2015,"We stayed at Forte do Vale for one week. Most enjoyable but we encountered a few problems.On arrival, & on checking in, we were advised the accommodation we had booked was not a one bed-room but a studio. We were glad we had the correct accommodation voucher & one hour later, we were given a beautiful apartment.The fittings were of a very high quality., with just about all you could need on holiday.We missed not having a kettle, having to boil water in a large pot, not idealThere was no oven either but a washing machine & dish washer. Quite strange.Staff were all very helpful & friendly, although there should have been more of them as only one barman in the evenings was not sufficient.We did not visit the restaurant so cannot comment on the food.Pool areas were attractive & there were plenty sun loungers & umbrellas. One thing we noticed, the man in charge of the pool area, appeared quite late on one occasion, & started to wash all the sun loungers. This was 10.30 a.m.! This should have been done much earlier in the day.Having said all that, these were only trivial things & they certainly did not spoil our holiday. It's to be hoped these points can be taken on board & then Forte Do Vale would certainly be entitled to it's 5 star rating.We would most certainly return.",Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,3
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Aygarcia823,24,Aygarcia823wrote a review Feb 2015,"We stayed in this hostel for a total of 2 nights and it was great. The staff was very accommodating and the hostel was impeccably clean. We stayed in a private room that was huge. We arrived after a long bus ride from Sevilla at 5:30 a.m. and although we couldn't check in and get into our room until after 2, they allowed us to take a nap on the couch in the movie room and store our luggage until we could check in. The bathrooms were clean and wonderfully designed with enough room for people to shower, blow dry their hair, and get ready for the day. The hostel also offered a dinner for 9 euros each night and it was a great option. Dessert was amazing. It also offered a free breakfast that even included pancakes. It was pretty central to the main sites to see since it was right in a train station.The free walking tour of belem was okay - our guide had just started giving the tour and wasn't really able to give us that much history. However, it was nice to have someone to bring you to the main places and guide you around the city.Overall, highly recommend this hostel. Great place to stay.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,5
Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,Barbara B,0,Barbara Bwrote a review Mar 2018,"We’ve been travelling now for over 5 weeks in Portugal and Casas do Porto is our favourite place to stay. The apartment was very comfortable, kitchen well supplied. But most of all, Olivia and Barbara made our stay    terrific. Great restaurant recommendations, they were such wonderful hosts.

Dom Carlos Liberty,294globetrotter,9,294globetrotterwrote a review Jan 2019,"I stayed at the hotel during a long weekend and found the staff very pleasant and helpful, the hotel very clean and quiet. It was a short walk from the city centre. The only reason that I don't give it an 'excellent' rate is that it would mean that there was nothing to improve on (and there's always something we could improve on). I stayed on my own and the room I had was just right for one person.Thank you for making my stay pleasant, especially as it was my birthday weekend.",Jan,2019,Jan 2019,2019-01-01,2019,4
Luna Clube Oceano,John R,74,John Rwrote a review Mar 2016,"Have stayed in Monica Isabel apartments/hotel many times. If Monica Isabel is Three star, Clube Luna is Seven star!

Casa Mitchell Apartments,Shirley G,6,Shirley Gwrote a review May 2013,Just spent a week their celebrating my wifes BIG 50!Could not fault the hotel in anyway. Sunbeds galore around the pool and so peaceful and as the hotel has only 16 rooms everyone got on so well swopping ideas of great places to go to and restaurants to eat in. The hotel is family run and the owners were so friendly and helpful. Only 5 minute walk to the old town square and loads of fab restaurants to eat in. O Manjar restaurantein Ruo do M.F.A.was out of this world but in general you will be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat. The beach is also only 5 mins away and also fab. The cafe across the street has a happy hour between 4 and 7 on a fri and a pint is only 1euro 60c!!!!!!!!Hey also forgot to mention it a kids free hotel so you wont have the hassle of screaming kid although we did get on like kids ourselfs a few days around the pool. Bring a few plastic cups for afternoon drinks around the pool as the hotel has no bar and owners do not mind at all. Also bring a few ice cube bags as there are no ice cube trays in freezer. ENJOY!!!,May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,5

Independente Principe Real,GwenMcCauley,64,GwenMcCauleywrote a review Nov 2015,"I'm not certain how it happened but I managed to get to be a senior citizen without ever staying in a hostel. On a friend's recommendation I changed that life-long habit recently by staying at The Independente Hostel & Suites in Lisbon.My stay was great and I'll definitely be back. I wasn't certain about sharing the bathroom facilities but I needn't have. As always in Portugal not only were they meticulously clean but offered a fair degree of privacy and men and women were separated. The bunks were very comfortable, although I must admit that folding my aging joints took some forethought. I was assigned a middle bunk. Getting up the stairs and into bed wasn't too bad, although pressing against the square wood of the frame resulted in some interesting bruises. Getting out was more problematic for me; especially for those dratted 3 a.m. trips to the loo that are so common to us older folks.Next time I'll be certain to request either a bottom or top bunk! As it was, as soon as I mentioned my challenges I was encouraged by the front desk staff to move to the bottom bunk since it wasn't booked.The staff was very friendly and most accommodating. Each bunk has a large locker but I was at the beginning of a 6-month stay so I had far too much luggage to fit. No worries, it was placed in a locked facility on the main floor where it was safe and I had access throughout my stay. There are lots of public lounge facilities and a basic kitchen area for really frugal travellers.I also loved the Decadante, both the bar and the restaurant. I'll be writing a separate and very positive review.The Independente has converted me to a hostel lover. I'll definitely be back. Don't know why it took me so long to discover this form of travel accommodation.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4
Four Seasons Fairways,Andrew O,31,Andrew Owrote a review Aug 2017,"Stopped in villa 3 from 24/07 - 5/08.Firstly I will start with the negatives, not many but the reason I didn't give a 5/5.1 Sun loungers around the villa pool are just plain uncomfortable look quite worn, only 4 loungers when villa sleeps 6 but worse only 1 parasol. I requested additional parasol and was charged €50 for 2 weeks. I would have preferred 2 parasols and be charged €50 extra on my booking.2 The villa pool had no depth markings - children???Positives and there are many of them!1 Arrived 4 hrs before check in time, villa was ready and were allowed in.2 Staff, from the maids, to reception to bar and restaurant staff are absolutely first class, an example, we are very wifi dependant ref my work, in villa 3 just outside the French doors to the pool signal was lost therefore I was unable to work outside. I mentioned at reception, next day 2 engineers moved the internal antenna and problem solved.3 Food and drink is not only good but excellent value the most I.E we dined at Casa de Campo ordered giant prawns at €47 same but larger portion at Fairways €17 and better!4 Villa clean and maids do a great job.Overall really good and I will return",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,2

PortoBay Liberdade,Annie123081,213,Annie123081wrote a review Dec 2022,"This was our first hotel in Portugal and it was a great welcome to Lisbon. The hotel is located on a quiet street right off the Avenue Liberdade.  It was about a 20 minute walk down to the tourist craziness.  The Avenue Liberdade is a nice street to walk on as it is pretty flat - unlike the rest of Lisbon.We upgraded to the Superior room and were very happy with the size, bed and amenities.The breakfast was a very good buffet.  We were there for 4 days so I wish we would have been told on day one that we could have ordered eggs prepared a different way than scrambled that was in the buffet. They should tell guests that when they check in for breakfast.  The coffee/tea service also needs to be better organized.  It took way longer than it should have to get coffee and tea delivered with the amount of servers they had on staff.  That is a simple thing to fix.The stars of the hotel though were definitely the front desk and support staff in the lobby.  They were so friendly and ready to help with any request. We found the same thing when we stayed at their Porto property so this must be a staple with this group.I would stay in any Portobay property in Portugal!",Dec,2022,Dec 2022,2022-12-01,2022,4

We are a family of three and were so happy that Reid’s has rooms with three proper (very comfortable) beds. Our room was outstanding with a beautiful view to the sea and gardens. The standard is very high. Every detail is considered. We enjoyed relaxing by the swimming pools, swimming, looking at the beautiful surroundings. The food was excellent, both the poolside and food at hotel bar, but especially the breakfasts, with a large variety of breakfast foods. Since we were here at Easter, they had thoughtfully made Easter candy available with a beautiful display of flowers and decorations. Flowers are everywhere here inside and out. Strolling the gardens is a treat for the senses. If you like birds, take a short stroll towards the cliffs at dusk and listen to the charming calls of the Cory’s Shearwaters. We highly recommend lovely Reid’s Palace!",Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,5

The house sits on the side of a mountain which provides amazing views. The owners were just the best hosts and even cooked us dinner the first night as my wife was too sick to dine out. They offer dinner and breakfast (which we had and loved it) for a very good price but if you do choose to dine at the house, make sure you bring cash as they don't accept credit cards (as you'd expect).

This was not well received.2 of us on each table of three then shared a pot of tea as they must have been making a point that they were table space short as we asked them to take 1 away as they wouldn’t reconfigure as we suggested.Cream for the scones was soft and warm as it had obviously been out of refrigeration too long as replacement cream was cold and a better texture.  Cakes were a good selection but in our opinion had been filled too soon so things that should have been crisp were soft.Jam in glass jars like in Motorway services and butter in pre packed tubs, I was disappointed to see this.Spare cakes cannot be boxed for you to take away.I was really hoping this afternoon tea would be better than all the others our group have experienced, afraid to say it wasn’t.",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,3

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,paulstephens,25,paulstephenswrote a review Jul 2016,"My wife and I have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Crowne Plaza in Vilamoura and rate the hotel as one of the best we have ever stayed in.  From the moment we checked in, to when we checked out every member of staff was extremely pleasant and very helpful.  We stayed in room 516 which had a side sea view and the room itself was spacious, very clean and well maintained during our stay.  It had a free safety deposit box and the wi fi signal was good throughout the hotel and around the pool.  I found the food in general both at breakfast and the evening meal very good but my wife struggled on a couple of nights due to the choices available so we ate out one night down at the marina.  The pool was one of the best we have ever used so we were in 2-3 times every day.  Getting a sun bed on the grassed areas around the pool at about 9.30 was never a problem but the day before we left it seemed very busy by 10.00 with all the sun beds taken.  Location wise the beach is 10 minutes away and the marina about 15 minutes. Overall we had a fantastic holiday and will certainly be returning to the Crowne Plaza in the future.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Muzy,30,Muzywrote a review Jun 2019,"This was our second visit to the Crowne Plaza in Vilamoura within a couple of years, the first time as a family and the second time as a couple. The hotel is lovely with modern décor, very well maintained and spotlessly clean, both inside and out. The staff will always great you with a smile and a friendly “Olá”, and nothing is too much trouble for them. Breakfast is plentiful, always kept fresh and well stocked with a great choice for all tastes, with the tables and surrounding areas kept clean and tidy even at times when it is busy. The huge pool and surrounding areas are lovely with plenty of space around the water’s edge as well as higher up on the grassed areas, which ensures you do not feel “hemmed in” or restricted when turning your lounger towards the sun to get that all-important suntan! The beach is literally a stones throw away, and there are plenty of loungers to choose from at a reasonable 11 euros for two beds and a brolly for a ½ day up to 2pm or 16 euros for the day. The bedrooms are spacious, clean and modern with pleasing décor along with a huge comfortable bed and pillows. Lots of space in wardrobes and drawers for clothes, but take a few spare hangers with you to avoid having to double-hang clothes. The room we stayed in had a safe, fridge, kettle and even an iron if you feel the urge for some domestic chores! The walk into the Marina is a pleasant 10 to 15 minute stroll, where there are plenty of bars, restaurants and shops to choose from. Overall, we had a very relaxing holiday and would highly recommend the Crowne Plaza.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,5

The reception area is lovely, clean and modern. The room itself was beautiful. Again very very clean, spacious, comfy beds and a unique bathroom. The buffet breakfast was fab and all the staff in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful.The pool area and outside areas again were spacious and very clean. The only downfall would be the charge to use the inside pool.

The staff was outstandingly friendly, the rooms and the overall ambience was very cozy and pleasant and the location was also very convenient to drive relatively quickly to many hiking spots.The pizzeria was also excellent - super delicious pizza with great view. The restaurant was “only” fine from the point of view of food - but the staff was outstandingly friendly.The bar and terrace are also totally beautiful and offer great views. Enjoying a coffee at sunrise in the morning is simply fantastic and heralds a perfect holiday day.",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,5
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,arabforbesie,22,arabforbesiewrote a review Apr 2007,"Good hotel, although the walls are a bit thin. That was not an issue for us as there were no rowdy parties. The rooms were clean, and made up daily, and were a reasonable size. Only a couple of English language channels on the tv.The pool was clean but the water was freezing. Only went in the once, never again.The buffet breakfast was as you would expect. cannot comment on other meals as we did not eat in the hotel. The a la carte menu looked expensive, the beers definitely were.The hotel was in a good position, near the town centre and with easy access to the main road to the golf courses we were playing.The hotel had internet access which was handy, with 3 levels of access (I think), per hour (5 euros), 24 hours and weekly (50 euros I think)The only criticism, and it is partly my fault, was the fee for the safety deposit box. I am pretty sure I paid in advance, but cannot say for definite, but was charged again at checkout. Although I got a receipt for the first payment, it did not say paid so I did not have any proof. I was not going to argue as prior to this I had a trouble free stay and it would not stop me from going back again",Apr,2007,Apr 2007,2007-04-01,2007,4

Ocean Gardens,andyH122,16,andyH122wrote a review Aug 2017,"Ooutdide of the busier areas of Funchal, on the right side of the island for quick and easy airport transfers, lies a wonderful hill side hotel. First glimpse may put you off as it seems like it's built over the firecourt/ parking area!However it's possibly one of the best hotels we have stayed at.So we have this well appointed hotel away from the busy town. Only 42 bedrooms, almost a boutique hotel, and even when full seems quiet! A wonderful view assured from every room as they face the sea. Good size balcony. Fridge on romantic with a reasonable selection of drinks and snacks. Wonderful comfy beds in good sized rooms. Big bathroom too. All very comfortable with lovely helpful and accommodating staff.The grounds and subsequent views are to die for. Well tendered hidden away garden areas. You can hide away without being seen if you so choose. Their swimming pool and area is clean and you can order drinks and food from morning through to early evening. They have a sauna near the pool however never saw anyone use it. Also massages on appropriate area near pool. The pool is easy to get in and out and overlooks Funchal and the sea!We only booked with B&B and found the breakfasts more continental than full English but excellent and the venue from restaurants again amazing.  Lots of fruit and a cold meats abd scrambled eggs. Lovely Maderia baked breads.. We left in the morning over full!We wanted to try evening meals out in restaurants on the island ir in Funchal. But we had some excellent meals in the hotels own restaurant. Good choice abd range and catering for European tastes. Nice fish and great value steaks etc. Good to amazing range of wines. The house red was incredible!So come here for a great value stay away from the crowds and chaos, for the views, for excellent service and lovely staff. You might want to hire a car, the hotel allows free safe parking, but there's a relatively frequent bus service and the hotel offers a free morning city drop off and early evening collection... But needs booking! Had we come for two weeks I dare say we would have spent more time relaxing in this excellent hotel and grounds, but this island needs to be explored!We will have to come back!",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Hotel Albergaria Dias,Alan B,9,Alan Bwrote a review Mar 2014,just spent first week in march at this wonderful hotel. my husband said to me for my 50th he would take me away for a week anywhere in the world. i chose this hotel because of the wonderful reviews on trip advisor and i wasnt disappointed. we were welcomed by the wonderful and friendly staff and offered a free drink. they make u so welcome and go out there way to be friendly and helpful. we got upgraded to the superior suite on the top floor because there were no rooms left on the third floor where we were meant to be. the views from our balcony were absolutely beautiful and we were so grateful for our upgrade. the hotel itself is very clean and tidy and in a fantastic spot. 5 minutes out the back gate and theres a row of restaurants on the left and right hand sides. our 2 favourites were the portao restaurant and the san jose. please avoid the chinese restaurant. we were going to eat there but kept seeing dogs coming out of it and wondered why then one night we saw the chinese lady with the glasses feeding a dog the remains of a cooked chicken. if u walk along by the waterfront you come to the town centre. loads of souvenir shops there that you can buy gifts. the town centre has lots of cobbled streets so not adviseable to wear high heels. i bought a pair of crocs from home and they were so comfy to wear and i usually complain about sore feet. i personally dont think its a place to take young kids or teenagers. its the kind of holiday to go on for a relaxing break. i just need to give a mention to the owner of the hotel...mr dias...what a lovely lovely man....he gets up every morning at 4.45am and has done for the last 14 years to prepare all his guests breakfasts and just has such a wonderful outlook on life and your jam at breakfast time is the best i have ever tasted. me and alan will be back to see you and your wonderful staff and thank u all for such a wondful holiday.,Mar,2014,Mar 2014,2014-03-01,2014,5

Legends' House by Sweet Porto,ItalianFromFrance,53,ItalianFromFrancewrote a review Nov 2023,"A perfect accommodation experience in Porto.It's not an apartment, it's not a hotel...  a boutique aparthotel maybe :-) ?It might not the cheapest apartment option in Porto but, the apartment is well organised and beautiful, and in our experience the girls at the desk were so helpful that it's definitely worth it.There is room tidying every day, although in our experience not real cleaning. Probably asking you get that as well.The location is great - like most of those close to the center. Easy access from the airport* and walking distance to MOST attractions and lot of restaurants.For those wondering... yes, porto is a bit hilly but overall you can walk around easily - even with a stroller - as long as you look at the best way to go before hand!There is a breakfast basket for the room option  when booking. It's full of good products (although there was never a pastel de nata😅) and very copious.If you like to take it slowly in the morning, eat a lot, or have a family it's a good option.If you just need a coffee and a quick bite it's probably wasted.*PS. Porto public transport is a joke - it's always so full you can barely fit in, even in a non touristy period or outside rush hour; buses don't follow schedule; that was a terrible city experience. We have two young ones, one with a stroller... oh what a nightmare. Traffic is bad, so using taxis or uber/bolt is more comfortable, very reasonably priced, but slow at any time except in between 10pm and 7am.",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,4
Ocean Gardens,artgal5445,3,artgal5445wrote a review Feb 2020,"We stayed here as part of a package called Portugal Getaways, and we expected a standard tourist hotel.  Instead, our spacious room had a lovely balcony with a stunning view of downtown Funchal, a delicious breakfast with eggs for my hearty breakfast-loving husband, and ample fresh fruit and juice plus yogurt and excellent croissants for me, and a gorgeous orchid in the room. The front desk staff, especially the daytime young woman, were helpful and professional advising on public bus schedules and even getting an extra hotel jitney for us one day. The gem of an upstairs rooftop garden with a pool, a bar, and lounge chairs galore was an added bonus and perfect for a relaxing drink after a day of sightseeing.  We only ate dinner there one night with fine pizza and salad so can't judge the meals other than breakfast.  We took several tours while we were in Madeira and heard from other visitors that the downtown hotels can be quite noisy, so were doubly glad to come home to our mountain lodgings on the #39 bus, so easy and convenient.  Highly recommend this clean, beautiful and friendly hotel.  (One thing I wish I had known is that the cruise ships are in on Mondays and Tuesdays so it's better to tour downtown on any of the other days--you can see the ships from the balconies.)",Feb,2020,Feb 2020,2020-02-01,2020,5

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,BelisariusUK,117,BelisariusUKwrote a review Jun 2014,"We stayed here at the end of our recent trip to the Azores. Unfortunately three nights was cut down to two because of a fog-cancelled flight from Horta. Although the hotel is situated outside the city centre in the Belem district, there is a great deal to do within a very short walk of the lobby! The maritime and archaeological museums, the planetarium, the Belem Tower, the monument to the discoveries (an amazing thing!), the long promenade alongside the Tagus to mention but a few. (I have also reviewed the company \"By Boat, Lisbon\". We were able to book that trip close by as well). We found the staff very friendly and welcoming, especially in the bar and the restaurant where we ate one night we stayed there. The meal was of excellent quality and made more enjoyable by the staff who were friendly and attentive.The hotel is at the water's edge on the Tagus and has superb views. it is very spacious, modern and very clean, with some great outdoor areas to eat and drink.(One tiny quibble - can they please do something about the strange and rather delicate light fittings near the bedside?)The breakfasts deserve their own special mention - you could spend the whole morning just drifting in and out of the restaurant sampling all the goodies!

The Mareta View is a bit more expensive than the Beach, but it is worth it! The balcony is a must, the beds are very comfortable and the small courtyard is well appointed. However, both breakfast are the same: fruits, bread, coffee, etc. Also, as in many European Hotels, there is NO room to put anything in the bathroom. What is the point of having a big bathroom if you have a minuscule counter and no shelves? But, all in all, a very good hotel.

Most of the negative in our case were some very peculiar design flaws. Our room had exactly one free electric plug but it was blocked by a TV cable that made impossible to connect our adapter. The air conditioning system had a 32 button remote control that was so hard to figure out that the room had a short manual to operate it. Still, we had to call front desk twice to set it (once at 4:00 am). Apparently, the system is also controlled from outside and at that time was not operating properly. Ample parking but the worst parking exit I have seen in Europe: it involves three extremely sharp turns just before a narrow steep ramp with two way traffic. The parking ticket was validated at checkout but with the 15 minutes it took to get our bags and maneuver the turns and the ramp, the parking ticket had expired. Had to get out of the car in the steep ramp with backed up two-way traffic and pay in a machine for the extra minutes. Still, I recommend the hotel if you can live with these design quirks.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,3
