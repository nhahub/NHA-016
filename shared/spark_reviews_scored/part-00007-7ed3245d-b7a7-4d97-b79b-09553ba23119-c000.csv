Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,brinleepaigexo,0,brinleepaigexowrote a review Jun 2023,"Returned home yesterday after a weeks stay here, was a little apprehensive after some of the reviews I saw on here before we arrived but we had the best time! Hotel was very clean, staff were lovely, food choice was always of huge variety everyday. Only downfall was the evening entertainment, kids mini disco was okay but the adults entertainment afterwards was very repetitive and boring. Would 100% return to this hotel",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,3
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,MadZim,51,MadZimwrote a review May 2022,"This facility has the potential to be THE ROYAL GEM of The Algarve!! The view from any room in the hotel including every dining area is outstanding!! So Picturesque!!! Seriously a breathtaking view! And the staff very accommodating, English-speaking (mostly), and cordial.However, with all the potential in the world, the quality of the food would drive guests to any OTHER location. Unfortunately, we ate 3 meals a day there for two days before we discovered there’s a downtown area only five blocks away with far better dining options!!The scrambled eggs and the bacon on the breakfast buffet were barely cooked; I know there are different preferences on the degree of “cooked” but were almost raw! We seriously had to ask the omelet station to recook our bacon from the buffet in the midst of making omelets for everyone who couldn’t handle the thought of eating the scrambled eggs! They did, however, have a huge variety of options with the breads, pastries, fruits, cereals and deli meats/cheeses.There are several additional dining options, with one being a higher end (called The One, which I will review separately), had excellent food; there’s a poolside option, and a limited menu in the Azur Bar with lovely inside and outside dining. However, the food was really bad at both of those!! One item on the menu is Shrimp Tempura…..sounds good, but is basically “shrimp on a stick”….it’s breaded in breadcrumbs rather than a tempura batter, and has a large toothpick running thru each prawn……. but it’s still actually one of the better options due to the camouflaging chili sauce that accompanies it!The prices are not consistent throughout; you will pay a different price for the exact same item and maybe a different price each day in the same place for things as simple as a coke;  kind of feels like it’s up to the individual server!Food service is also INCREDIBLY slow; one day (with only 1 hour for lunch due to a conference we were attending) we waited FORTY FIVE minutes for a club sandwich, at which time we told them to just cancel the order. We did raise the issue with the very nice hospitality manager, who apologized and the (also very nice) server brought our club sandwich to the lobby packed in a to-go box…..but there was no longer any time to enjoy it – and the accompanying fries were ice cold. While talking to the hospitality manager, we mentioned the overall poor quality of food, citing the Shrimp Tempura as an example, but she had no idea they even offered Shrimp Tempura on their menus!!I don’t want to sound snobbish about the food; part of the problem is that my husband is an excellent cook (chef quality!) which kind of raises the expectations for food you’re paying for outside of your home!While on the topic of food service, I have to address the game many of the conference attendees were playing while staying there. It’s called “Will I get MY food or someone else’s”? Meal after meal we watched servers carry our order to other tables, or deliver someone else’s’ food to our table. It actually became more entertaining than frustrating I’m thinking they are not familiar with the concept of either knowing table numbers from memory (that they associate with each order) or at the very least, having numbers stuck to the tables to help direct orders.In their defense, I do understand that in locations like this, the work and the staff are seasonal. Hotels and restaurants MIGHT get a handful of employees who worked there last year at this time, BUT they might also get an equal number of brand new (and untrained) employees. Covid probably only made that worse! There was one server who absolutely didn’t have a clue……he was nice enough, but wasn’t capable of much more than bringing silverware, salt and pepper. We were there mid-April, which is probably just after their high season (and ramp up of staffing) occurred; I have to hope they get their act together. I keep telling myself it was just poor timing on our part.We were there for eight nights, most of which was very windy and rainy, making the walk to other restaurants less likely. So we felt kind of stuck, which is not how you want to feel in a NH Hotel Chain. Yes, the Tivoli is part of NH Hotels, which up until now has been one of our favorites in Europe!  On our second day there we noticed two women walking the property with clipboards and making notes …..what one would typically assume are “evaluators from Corporate”….a great concept IF they are there to see that the poolside restaurant is never open when it states it will be open, or IF they welcome feedback from hotel guests rather than relying on their own observations.Now that I’ve probably told you more about the food service than you really want to know, and I have to hope that it’s improved since we left a week ago……I’m going to move on to the room. It was a lovely suite with plenty of space, lots of closets, a huge bathroom and a huge balcony. The Housekeeping staff for this suite was INCREDIBLE. The room was cleaned in the morning, and then cleaned again (with a second set of fresh towels and bed turndown) every evening. She was incredible!!!The Spa and staff were also exceptional!On the evening of our last night there, my husband made a quick trip to the room and noticed the power was out, which he reported to the front desk. At 10:30 PM when we attempted to turn in, the power was back on, but water was running down the rope that held the bedside lamp to the ceiling…..literally it was raining at our bedside, and the nightstand (containing meds) had 1” of water in it. No one called or texted to let us know earlier; the front desk staff told us housekeeping had reported the incident and they wanted to see how we wanted to handle it before doing anything further. REALLY!?!? After sending a repairman, and housekeeping to clean up after him, we got back in our room at midnight. We were checking out and heading home the next morning, and were now looking forward to it. There was never any offer of compensation or discount for the inconvenience in this high-priced suite.I know this has not been a favorable review, but it’s an honest one. I would not want to assure others that they have probably rectified all these issues because I’m guessing they probably re-occur annually with the frequent change of personnel. But I also don’t want to suggest that it’s not fixable……my advice would be to stay there, enjoy the breathtaking view, know that your prices will never be consistent, eat as many of your meals as possible at THE ONE (their higher end restaurant) or in town, avoid the breakfast buffet…..or wait until mid-summer to visit so they have time to fine-tune everything that’s not working at the opening of their high season!The only other thing I want to mention is that we had no idea until we checked out (and after leaving cash tips for every server for every meal since we arrived) that they were adding automatic gratuities to every bill. So whether ordering drinks for large groups of conference attendees, private meals, or room service…….be aware that you’re going to be leaving lavish tips when you combine your already generous tip with what they are adding to your bill.Just be aware!Oh. they also have the most remarkable rooftop bar!!! can't forget to mention that.....it's THE PLACE TO BE assuming the weather cooperates!",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,2
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Yvonne W,14,Yvonne Wwrote a review Oct 2019,"Myself and my husband have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Tivoli, this was our fourth visit to this hotel. The room we were given was on the 6th floor no balcony and view of the car park, not ideal, also the water in your room incurs a fee never had that before so we walked down to the local supermarket and brought our own. We were half board and breakfast was fantastic much improved from previous stays,dinner is buffet style and leaves room for improvement, we only had dinner one night choosing to eat out in the town.On previous visits you could swop dinner for lunch but that's changed now such a shame.As lovely as the hotel is we were so disappointed this time, I feel it does not warrant 5 stars it's very pricey for drinks that depending on weather you were by the pool or in the bar the price varied, we will look at other options when we go back to caverio. On a good note the cleaners keep the hotel to a very high standard.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Denise C,0,Denise Cwrote a review Jun 2024,"Stunning resort on the beach with sparkling, spacious rooms and fabulous amenities. It's better than the pictures. And it's great value for what we paid. After three nights we wished we had booked a longer stay. We had a spacious two bedroom apartment with all the services of a hotel, including daily housekeeping and room service. The staff was so genuinely friendly and helpful.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,roystonwb0065,47,roystonwb0065wrote a review Sep 2016,"We only stayed at this classy place for a couple of nights but found the place to be very welcoming. The Rooms are very slick and designer with plenty of room. We had a one bed apartment and it was extremely well facilitated. The on site facilities are more than adequate; parking, swimming pools and downstairs bar service and the nearby beach is a blessing with only a five minute walk at the max. Highly recommended.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Pistoi,2,Pistoiwrote a review Sep 2025,"It was our first time staying at a family hotel with our little one of 2 years old and we had an amazing experience at this hotel. The food is amazing and there is so much choice, the room is impeccable and the cleaning staff changes the towel twice a day. The pools are really good and fun for kids! A special mention goes to the staff, everybody at the hotel was so nice and accommodating and our little one did enjoy the kids club's activities and in particular George and Lara were so good to her.  All the animation guys were lovely and you can see that they are working very well together.The evening shows are the best ones I've seen so far in a hotel.Overall a very positive exprerience and we will definitely be back!Little room for improvement:The elevators are often full and at times you need to wait a long time to get one freeThe big pool could have slighly warmer waterThe splash pool could have times when the big bucket doesn't work so the small kids can enjoy it freely without fear",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,4
Saccharum,mjbwn5598,0,mjbwn5598wrote a review Aug 2016,This hotel is situated in a bespoke corner of this quiet resort. It is stylish and well equipped. Our sea view room was simply beautiful with high end fittings and a wonderful sea view balcony.The 8th floor infinity pool was fantastic and the spacious sun terrace areas were never full. The food was really good with lots of variety. My only criticisms are that the breakfast was a little chaotic with a lack of clean glassware and crockery. Also the gym was unattended in the morning from 8 am and it was far too hot with no ability to reduce the air con or get a towel or water.In summary I would definitely go back to this hotel for s relaxing break.,Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Michael M,18,Michael Mwrote a review May 2015,"Before I travelled to the Belmar, I had asked for a specific room as I had visited the hotel before, although I thought it a long shot I was more them pleased to find that I had the room I'd requested, check was slick and smooth and the room was ready even though we arrived before the check in time,  the room ( apartment ) was spotlessly clean, our room been right alongside the infinity pool and yards from the spa, food in the restaurant was superb, The  staff were  very polite and room service etc very good,  my only concerns were the gym was not open till nine in the morningAnd for me it was too late as I like to train first thing and then the days free,  Also the spa pools were treated like a children's play pool with lots of children running in and out etc which when you have time to relax it's not what you want, Although I must say that one pool was closed due to a leak so maybe in there defence that was the reason, all in all I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, I'm a regular visitor to Lagos so I'm sure I'll be back,",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,margaret c,2,margaret cwrote a review Jul 2023,"This hotel was very very good, from the start we were treated with the best care and attention as my husband had mobility problems and they gave us a room close to everything. The pool was great, always beds available and the location was great in between the old/new town. Beach is a 10 minute walk with golden sands and water was refreshing. I used the gym every day which was a blessing. The food was very good and waiting staff very friendly especially Bia who was always smiling. It was also good to go to other restaurants in the hotel chain. I recommend the Italian and Indian restaurants. A big thank you to the manager and reception staff who had to accommodate a full football team when we were there, but still had time to attend to the other guests. We would return to this hotel as it was brilliant, quality entertainment and the cakes are amazing. It is a quiet hotel which we really liked.",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,The_Lictor,34,The_Lictorwrote a review Sep 2017,"We can for a log period of 10 days. The hotel looked very nice when we arrived and the room was ready before 4PM, which was a good sign.However, in our stay we met some poor standards that should never be met in a 5* hotel (and this is NOT a 5* hotel).First, room was dated. One balcony door wouldn't lock, black stains in bath, and not a clean feeling.we arrived on Thursday, on Friday evening someone came to tidy the beds quickly. On Saturday and Sunday no maid came, and no Towels were replaced... So we went down to the reception, they were surprised and promised that someone will come tomorrow. They did, at 17:50, and she said that she is not being paid overtime and her shift is finishing at 18:00, so she just left a bundle of clean towels, and went. We went back to the reception... this time we got a bottle of wine from the manager and a letter inviting us for dinner. Nice, we thought. We went to the reception to ask what is this dinner, and they said that it is the same dinner we already getting, as we are staying Half board... so an empty gesture it was.The next day (5 days after we arrive) someone actually came and cleaned the room for the first time. Hurry!!Also, the restaurant was understaffed on occasions, which meant that it had unoccupied tables that the staff couldn't clean so we had to sit in a cold and not pleasant conference room to have our breakfast.The acoustic is bad, and combining with the shows from the downstairs bar, meaning that you can;t have a quite time in your room until after 22:00, not very convenient when you have small children trying to fall asleep.Food was average, coffee awful, fresh fruit great.Extra charges for the safe in the room...  really??Good things:Very good location to go to the old town, the new town centre and the seaside.Big rooms.Free beer for dinner.very nice pool.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,2
Lisbon Destination Hostel,FEINT,14,FEINTwrote a review Dec 2013,"The hostel is in a great location, it is close to the subway and also the Rossio train station. This station has direct trains to Sintra which is an amazing town to visit. The hostel is close to many of the sights of Lisbon as well as the night life. I stayed in a 6 bed room and the walls were pretty thin, so you could here people from the other rooms. The room was well equipped, big, comfortable and clean. There are no en-suites. The room looked over the square and the view was amazing. The main area is really nice where everyone can sit and relax, it also has a hammock.The free breakfast was excellent with crepes being served each morning. There is also a really cool chill out movie room.The staff are friendly and some are helpful but the check in process and check out process was rather tedious with accounting issues. I was told there was money owing when there wasn't. Apart from that minor issue, I recommend this hostel and would stay again.",Dec,2013,Dec 2013,2013-12-01,2013,4
PortoBay Serra Golf,Margaret M,40,Margaret Mwrote a review May 2017,"My husband and I spent two nights at the Porto Bay as part of a walking holiday. This is a really lovely hotel with attractive grounds. The foyer was full of flowers. We had upgraded to the Ballesteros room which was huge with a private balcony. Excellent large, firm bed.There was a good bathroom with two wash hand basins. It felt very luxurious. There is wifi in the bedroom as well as tea and coffee making facilities.The beer in the fridge was warm (but that is only a minor comment) so we went downstairs and had drinks in the lounge. A very pleasant experience. The staff were very helpful.We tried out the swimming pool which is not very big but makes for a refreshing dip after one has been walkingWe were on half board basis and found the food to be very good and varied. There was also an ample buffet bar for breakfast including sparkling wine, which I duly sampled.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,CJPOB,82,CJPOBwrote a review Mar 2024,"Spectacular hotel in the heart of Lisbon's most fashionable boulevard and the service cannot be beat.We spent four nights in the very lovely Valverde Hotel and it was perfect!  From the morning breakfast to the evening turndown service it was an absolute pleasure.  More than the amenities, it is the staff and service that differentiates the Valverde from other hotels, we felt.The entire team at the Valverde seems to be completely customer focused and ready to assist in anyway. From dinner reservations to suggestions of attractions to see, their team was so very helpful.Beyond the service and location, the hotel is beautifully appointed and  all of the finishing are very high quality.  Our room was spacious and overlooked the pool and had all the amenities we could have needed.There is an on-site restaurant, which was fabulous, and a bar that stays open late. The hotel is also very close to shopping, dining, pubic transit, and the exciting sights of Lisbon.The art collection that adorns the facilities is wonderful and, the hotel smells great.It is not the least expensive property in Lisbon but the value and service for the price is worth it.We highly recommend the Valverde and are anxious to return again.",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,5
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,etd2015,63,etd2015wrote a review Sep 2015,"I needed to relax in the sunshine and this hotel gave me all I needed for 4 wonderful days. The balcony facing sea and golf course was great for reading in peace and buffet breakfast in the sunshine was wonderful with good healthy choices. The pool area was a bit packed with rows of sunbeds but not all were occupied and it was quite calm most of the time as the young men were probably off golfing. I wondered why they had not developed more of the grounds to create quiet seating areas. The hotel is surrounded by golf courses and villas as well as right near the fantastic beach  and as children had gone back to school it was not too crowded.  We stayed for 5 nights and any longer might have begun to get a bit boring without a car but the whole area is nice to walk around and long walks on the beach are brilliant.The hotel is a strange mix of styles with old English hunting scenes, tiles, a thing like a large padded headboard on the wall in our corridor and  a lot of geometric patterns (no flower pictures anywhere, I suspect it may cater for Muslim tastes in that respect). However  it was full of middle aged English and Irish guests and I hardly heard any other language spoken, not even Portuguese.The 2 restaurants were quite good for main courses, but there is a range of decent restaurants over the road which overlook  the sea and give more variety and better value for money.  The hotel has a seafood buffet on a Sunday night which is expensive but OK if you want to stuff yourself with mass produced food.There is live music every night which was probably aimed at older cliental and to be honest did not add atmosphere to the bar area which was a little dreary.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone, whether they are playing golf or not and I think it would be equally enjoyable for families or younger people as long as they are not looking for noisy nightlife. If you want to see something of Portugal then I would suggest car hire.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,4

Quinta do Furão,TreacleMusic,33,TreacleMusicwrote a review Apr 2019,"This hotel gives a good impression of Madeira, with traditional food and ambience and a warm welcome.  Our room was spacious, well equipped (including tea-making facilities for the Brits) and comfortable.  The only downside was that the window of our room was small and let in little light, though there are rooms with balconies.  The food in the restaurant has a strong Madeiran character, with plenty of choice.  The hotel is in a very quiet location on top of a cliff with a coastal path running past and some fine views in all directions.  The staff are very attentive to detail and responded very well to a small error in a picnic we bought.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4

Casa Mitchell Apartments,KTHXBAI,88,KTHXBAIwrote a review Jul 2015,"During the summer season this is dedicated to Thomson Holidays so everyone there is British and there are no children. It is quiet, really quiet, and the neighbourhood is quiet too with no bars or clubs nearby. The beach is only ten minutes away but it is a steep walk down and I strongly recommend using the magnificent beach lift for the return trip.The apartments are all good but they do vary in their design and some are better than others. The kitchens are well equipped and the bathroom is fine with a really good shower and unlimited hot water. The maid comes in on five days (not Mondays or Fridays) and is very friendly and helpful, as are all the personnel.The pool is small but adequate if one wishes to bathe rather than swim. The poolside area is spacious with enough loungers for everybody.There is a mini-market at the end of the street and a couple of larger supermarkets less than ten minutes away. The marina is about fifteen minutes walk and worth taking a look.If you read the Thomson brochure carefully and decide to come, you will not be disappointed. It truly offers excellent value for money.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,4

Luna Clube Oceano,BFC15,10,BFC15wrote a review Aug 2017,"When booking, I requested a higher floor. My request was not granted and we ended up in a basement studio with no balcony and no privacy. We had children wandering into the area outside our patio doors some days...this would not happen if it had been a balcony.  I am very, very disappointed. The maid was not adequate and did not turn up each day until 5pm. The equipment in the kitchen was barely enough.  It's a good job that we didn't want to cook a meal. We didn't even have a pen oven, but I have read that other apartments do. We even had to beg the bar to lend us two wine glasses. Not factors for a good holiday. On arrival, and after being told that we couldn't move rooms, although Ruben did try for us, I asked for two bulbs to be repaired. The man who came down to do this left greasy hand marks all over our patio doors and broke the light shade on the patio. The hand marks were there all week.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Fesj1991,64,Fesj1991wrote a review Feb 2016,"The hotel itself is very nice. Lots of mini shops inside and places to eat. Prices are a bit expensive, but the breakfast was worth it (in my opinion).Staff is very friendly and helpful, ready to help in every situation. The gym was ok, a bit smaller than i expected, but usually very empty and the swimming pool looked nice, however, being winter i didn't go near it.I stayed in a standard suite and it was a bit bigger than expected, with a nice balcony and everything, only issue I had was with the ventilation system, which would sometimes not work or take forever to change the temperature, even after setting it to cold I could still sense warm air coming out of it.A bit far from the centre, but since I was travelling on business, wasn't really an issue.The entrance could be a bit better for people that are not getting there by car. They have many barriers and makes it difficult to find the correct place to walk to the door without having to look out for cars all the time.Wifi is a bit expensive. In this age, we usually expect wifi to be included, so the prices seemed a bit high when looking at it.Overall a nice place. Would stay again if travelling for work.",Feb,2016,Feb 2016,2016-02-01,2016,4

HolaCamp Albufeira,mugsy2007,7,mugsy2007wrote a review Aug 2013,"Only my second time staying at a campsite but won't be my last. We booked a residential which is a mobile home because we were sold on the outside space whereas my parents at the last minute booked a bungalow as it was the only option left and sadly we were miles from each other. Literally a car drive. The campsite is huge and is like it's own little town. We were in the Grove and it was deadly quiet living among permanent residents which was a bit strange. The mobile home seemed fine at first view but toward the end of the week you did spot that it was starting to show it's age and looked a bit rough around the edges in places.The Bungalow had views of the campers and near the restaurant and pool and so was much more interesting place to be if we come back we'd definitely book one of these but preferably one with a larger fridge than the one in my parents F Bungalow it was tiny and no good for a weeks visit. Although, we did see that some of the others had normal sized fridges. The verandah had a hammock on it which the kids loved and a picnic table which blew the mobile home plastic chairs and small terrace away. We could also close off the verandah with a bench to stop my wondering one year old running away which made life a lot easier. Air con in both places worked really well and is a must during August. The self service restaurant was excellent value and was great fun in the evening with entertainment every night. The sunset pool party was a highlight as well as coronation street star doing karaoke on our last night.The pool was always busy and getting a sun lounger was nigh on impossible as people reserved them with their towels very early. It also always looked super hot and not that welcoming for non sun worshipped like us. No parasols are provided so take one if you want to spend the day their unless you want to fry. There is a place to stand them although these are a quite in demand too.Albufeira itself is not much to write home about itself but some of the beaches near by we're stunning. Evaristo and Castelo were the ones we went to and everything is so well signposted, clean and well taken care of. The central location of Albufeira was great for moving around the Algarve as well.I know I'm a campsite newbie but from my perspective it was well run, very organised, secure, clean and safe. A great place to stay especially with kids.a visit.",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,3

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",John M,64,John Mwrote a review Sep 2018,"Belmond Hotels are really nice and have a lot of character. This one is no exception. It consists of two buildings, one is about 100 years old and the other about 60 years old. We stayed on the top floor of the old building and had a balcony overlooking the sea and the harbor. We could see the sea and the mountains and both are integral to the island. we came in summer and that is not high season. Spring and Winter are high season. But in summer its not too hot but it hot enough. The hotel has two great swimming pools, and offers a section built out on rocks that allows swimming in the very clean sea. Staff everywhere in this hotel work very hard to help. The room we had was big, clean, elegant. Older style furniture but in excellent condition. Bathroom had old style fixtures but in excellent condition. Because the hotel consists of two buildings, it took us two sets of elevators to get to the pool. We did not get to try the gym or spa but both looked great. Perks are free nonalcoholic drinks in the room, free tennis, free ices in the afternoon at the pool. Breakfast was outstanding and the setting at the pool terrace overlooking the sea was wonderful. The island is well worth the trip. Lots to do and see.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Chloe V,2,Chloe Vwrote a review Aug 2023,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel from July 2nd until the 8th 2023. To say this hotel is a 4 star like advertised would be a lie. This hotel is no where near a 4 star. The room we were allocated was infested with Ants and various other bugs crawling all over the floors and surfaces. The bed was 2 single beds pushed together, which is usually comfortable, however, this bed did not have a connected cover and was impossible for us to sleep next each other. We were told there would be music playing in a restaurant outside our hotel until 12:00am every night. This music did not stop until 4am every single night leaving us unable to sleep due to the thin walls and the loud bass shaking the bed. We were told we were not allowed to make noise in our room after 22:00pm but this music continued obnoxiously loud until 4am. The standards of his hotel were ridiculous, at the buffet there were flies all over the food and no protection was taken to stop this. The hotel staff were nice however looked as if they were tired from working all day and did not smile or talk to each other once which was very sad to see. We usually never leave negative reviews on hotels we stay at because we love every single one however this hotel was horrendous and definitely not worth the money. If you are in Albufeira find a different hotel because this one is atrocious!",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,1
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,forgetmeknot21,34,forgetmeknot21wrote a review Nov 2014,"We returned home this week from a 6 day break which we hoped would be relaxing.  Unfortunately it wasn't. The hotel is a modern building with all the things you would expect from a 5 star rating.  The room was fine, as was the beds and bedding.  Comfy mattress and pillows.  Bathroom is big and didn't understand the need for glass walls which you can see everything thru.  Including using the toilet.  So the blind was used all week.  There was a kettle in the room but no cups, or tea, coffee etc.  So you had to ask for some every day if you needed it.  I always take my own, so much easier.  Loved the ice machine and used it a few days.  Fridge to store fresh milk and a few cans of drink.  Bathrobe and simple toiletries supplied.  The breakfast was ok, same choice daily so nothing special.  But the orange juicing facility is a bonus.  Had plenty of vitamin C which was lovely.Now the bad part.  I have to say this is a review from a stay in November so bear that in mind.  The weather was lovely and warm and I love to swim.  So down to the pool armed with sun cream etc.  No mattresses, asked at reception, sorry gone to be repaired and washed.  Nothing available.  So had to lay on a hard surface on just a towel.  Swimming, The pool is very cold at this time of year and I am a wimp.  So I went to reception and asked about the indoor pool.  Yes you can use it at a cost of 10 euro per day.  No I just want to swim for half hour, yes 10 euro please.  That's a no then.  Back to a hard bed.  Now also we were not the only guests by the poolside.  So why they don't send the mattresses in phases I don't understand.  So then they would have some available for guests when they wanted them.Now the disgusting.The biggest seagulls I've seen at close range.  yes using the pool as a bath.  I've never seen this before anywhere in the world I've stayed that had an outdoor pool.  So they had exclusive use of the guest pool.  Feathers everywhere and bird poo around the pool edge and in the water at the bottom of the pool.  I pointed this out at reception and was told what could they do?  Its a hazard of the area.  Maybe install an electronic bird scarer would be one choice. This is unacceptable to me personally, I did see 2 men swimming in it, but I'm a bit more fussy as to where I dive in. So its my opinion that the outdoor should be closed in the winter months and let guests use the indoor pool at no extra cost.",Nov,2014,Nov 2014,2014-11-01,2014,2

Eurostars Porto Douro,Marian L,2,Marian Lwrote a review Oct 2022,"This hotel is perfectly located. Out of the crowd, short walk aling the river from the city centre.Nice welcome, fine breakfast.We were given room 501. Never go there!Instead of a view of the river we were facing a high wall. No view at all. Hardly any daylight.Next to the window was a ventilator of the airco system of the entire hotel making a noise 24/7.On the other side was the rooftop terrace  great view but after a party the staff was cleaning, transporting tables etc the whole evening using the emergency exit next to our room. Every time when that door closed it produced a bang on our wall so we couldn’t not sleep. After midnight I friendly asked the staff to be a bit silent. Their answer was: go to the frontdesk. We have to clean…!I went to the frontdesk and they promissed me to take action. They did. No excuses.. nothing.Would never go their again.

Ocean Gardens,nina k,3,nina kwrote a review May 2016,Just returned from a 4 day trip. The views from the hotel were amazing. The twin room was kept clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had half board and regrettably this is what let the hotel down. Breakfasts were minimal and the evening meal provided was not what was expected from a 4* hotel. It seemed to me that the salads had been prepared early in the day and kept in the fridge all day making then totally tasteless. Also had to purchase the water from the mini bar in room at €4 for a litre bottle. Due to having to book the courtesy bus 24 hours in advance we felt it was inadequate.,May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,2

Luna Hotel Da Oura,TandWtraveller,470,TandWtravellerwrote a review Jul 2019,"This hotel was booked at fairly short notice for a three night stay Friday to Monday. I have only visited Albufeira once before and that was fifteen years ago. I wanted somewhere clean and quiet with a pool and easily accessible to the main areas. There were only a handful of options I would say fit my requirements at short notice, but Luna Hotel Da Oura was chosen from them for a reasonable price and the better location. We booked a one bedroomed apartment on a self catering basis. I sent no email in advance of our arrival as I often do.We arrived quite late in the evening of Friday the 28th of June, having taken a private transfer from Faro Airport, which took around forty minutes. I was surprised at the entrance to the hotel being through an underpass which seemed a little unusual. The hotel is almost secreted away, you can see it, but not easily identify the entrance. Reception is large and airy with some bright soft furnishings and a large cascading waterfall water feature. We were quickly checked in and issued two key cards to our room (321) at the end of the corridor on the third floor.Our room was massive, in fact it was twice the size of the adjacent rooms which seem to be mainly studios with a balcony. Our apartment had the footprint of two studios and as such, two separate balconies which faced over the back of the hotel and a new pool area. Having the two balconies would have been even better had the dividing wall been taken down or an archway put in, but either way we still had a lot of outdoor space for just the two of us.We had storage in the entry hall, with iron and board, plus a safety deposit box which we did not use. There was a bathroom with toilet, bidet, sink/vanity area, hairdryer and batch with shower attachment over. It was awkward to reach the taps if you were not in the bath, as the shower screen could not be opened to allow easier access to the tap. You ran the risk of turning the taps on and getting dialed by the shower head, the push button on the mixer tap didn't work well so you didn't know where the water might come out. We were provided with towels, a slip mat and bottled toiletries which were quite pleasant.Our kitchen area had a sink, halogen hob and microwave. Under the counter fridge-freezer and enough cupboard space. The big plus was a dishwasher being provided and a washing tablet if we chose to use it. A sideboard held cutlery and some additional items, like tea towels. All said it was a very well equipped holiday apartment kitchen. Our dining table sat four, there was a large modern sofa bed that seated three, plus an easy chair. TV showed a number of channels. Some films were English but subtitled in Portuguese. The balcony off the lounge had a table and two chairs plus a clothes airer. The balcony off the bedroom had no furniture. Both the living area and bedroom had air conditioning units and the remote control provifed wired both without a fee. The hotel has fairly good free wi-fi across the grounds and room, we certainly had no issues with it.The bedroom had a huge six foot wide bed, which was very comfortable. A dressing table and morrow and two large wardrobes with sliding doors. I have to say for what we paid it was excellent value for money, especially in late June. Being at the end of the corridor we found it quiet, even though outside at the end of the hotel grounds was the  main road through Albufeira.The new pool is essentially a quiet pool with a shed in the corner with vending machines. Outside the front of the hotel is the original pool with a poolside snack bar, which played music. The staff were very friendly, and the snack not too dear. There was a bar inside the hotel called Bakus which offered a happy hour from 5pm, but it was too early in the day to come in and sit in an artificially lit room. The happy hour should be at the pool bar and make the most of people still enjoying the day or relax with a couple of sundowners before preparing for the night.The hotel is less than ten minutes walk from the strip, which is extremely busy and can be rowdy. Otherwise you can walk the thirty minutes down to the old town or take the tourist train from the strip for â‚¬3 single or â‚¬5 for the day. The ride is bumpy, but it is a little quicker and more fun.We ate breakfast at Fat Cats just a couple of minutes away to the left as you leave the hotel and the following day at Charlie's which is around the back of the hotel. Both were good value. There is a small shop in the underpass to the hotel for snacks, but a larger Pingo Doce supermarket is just across the main road, plus a mini market across the road towards Fat Cats. Another shop to call into in the same area is Pao Da Aldeia, a very busy bakery in the morning and great for Portuguese sweet treats.I have read reviews that say this hotel is dated and old, it isn't slick like you might expect, but it is a fairly comfortable and clean place to stay. We were long weekend visitors and Albufeira does attract a lot of stag and hen groups, despite this I had no issues with groups or noise during this visit, it seemed to be predominantly family orientated. I don't think you can ask for much more except the maids shouldn't be coming to clean your room between 4-5pm. Traditionally a siesta time for most tourists.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4

Bura Surfhouse,Kathy M,0,Kathy Mwrote a review Jul 2016,"I have just finished a 7 night stay at Bura and it was honestly amazing. I chose to stay at Bura for quite a few reasons - firstly, I was travelling alone but am quite a social person so didn't want to spend my holiday alone. Their website and Facebook page painted the picture of a friendly, welcoming place where you'd never be short of someone to have a yarn with and Bura definitely did not disappoint in this area. I have stayed in 50+ hostels around the world and the staff at this one were by far the friendliest I have ever come across, and they were really genuine too. I never felt like they were being nice to me just because they had to for work. They created an atmosphere that encouraged guests to socialise too so by the time I left I felt like I had 30 new friends!I also chose Bura because of the pool and the access to activities. I'm the sort of person that likes my holidays to be a mixture of relaxing and being active and I was easily able to get the best of both worlds at Bura. I spent many a day relaxing by the pool with a cocktail but I also tried surfing, power kiting and kayaking while I was there (which were all great). I was able to easily organise these through reception.Some special mentions:Ellie - the first face I met at Bura. Gave me a great tour of the facilities and helped me find food at a late hour after a long day of travelling - very important to a hungry backpacker!Gianluca - made me feel very welcome my first night when he was on the bar and everyone else had already gone into town.Hywel - one of the nicest guys I've ever met. Came surfing with me and made theday heaps of fun. Not so good at scrabble or skateboarding though.Louise - always went the extra mile to make sure she was offering Bura's guests the best experience. On several different occasions I observed her researching restaurants or activities to widen her knowledge or make sure she knew exactly how to explain an activity. We also had some great chats about everything from religion to my love life!Katy - I had email contact with Katy prior to arriving and she always replied in a prompt and pleasant manner and was able to answer all of my queries. She also gave me some great life pep talks!Becky - a great example of how friendly and genuine the staff are. I met Becky in the kitchen one night and she wasn't on shift so could've been doing her own thing but she struck up a conversation with me instead and we had the first of many great evenings.Big Kev - amazing chef and knows some really great games. He taught me a cool one out in town one night and everyone got really into it.Olly - legendary cocktail maker and all-round great guy. Made me look forward to the bar opening for more than just being able to get a drink!!Py -Chris - helpful, friendly, inclusive, introduced me to the best pizza I've ever had.Matt and Chelsea - a super fun couple who were great at bringing people together.Nick - a great guy who was always happy to help. Perhaps gingas do have souls after all ;-)Gina - was great to talk to a Kiwi after living away from home for so long! Helped me a lot at reception.Katie - the overall success of Bura is obviously down to her management. She's done a great job of staff recruitment and she always went out of her way to look after guests. She should be very proud of her staff and hostel.(Py, you're awesome too. You're also just the most competitive person I've ever met so I figured you'd be scanning the list to see if what I'd said about you was better than everyone else so I couldn't resist hahaha)",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5

Hotel dos Templarios,chris_butler_uk,97,chris_butler_ukwrote a review Jun 2012,"A four star hotel that didn't have any read weakness and is very well situated for easy access to the old town and (provided you can face a climb) the convent that dominates the town.Rooms are clean, staff helpful, common areas spacious, parking convenient, gardens attractive, breakfast extensive and fresh (even at 10:00) and one one side of the 'L' shaped hotel, the balcony views are excellent.  In short, we had no complaints, a good view and a place right on the doorstep of the old town.",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,4
Pestana Bahia Praia,Helena A,24,Helena Awrote a review Mar 2018,You need to visit Azores and this hotel is in the right location to travel around S. Miguel. I suggest to rent a car and travel around the island. The people are very nice and the sensation of being in the heart of the Atlantic Ocean is unique.,Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,5
Vila Galé Coimbra,Diane M,4,Diane Mwrote a review Aug 2018,"We stayed for 2 nights. Drove from Estoril.The objective of the stay was to visit Portugal dos Pequenitos and have some family time.It was very hot (in the 40°C range) during our stay. The Ac was very welcoming.The family room was nice and spacious. It is composed of a seating area which is converted into 2 beds and the main bedroom is separated by pocket doors. Each area has access to the balcony as well as its own TV. The kids sleeping area also has direct access to the door. This I was a bit uneasy about as I am a deep sleeper. I was a bit worried about the kids waking up and walking out of the room. We set up obstacles to the door however there was no escape attempt.We always kept 1 of the door cards in the power slot so that the room was cool when we returned.Breakfast was very good. We would take snacks for the kids as they are not big eaters first thing in the morning. Yogurt, fruit and a sandwich. Staff had no issue with this.The staff was very nice.We took advantage of the pool. It was very refreshing during the heat wave. Snacks by the pool are actually made inside the hotel and for this reason take some time however do eventually arrive.Ice cream is readily available at the pool.The spa seemed very nice and relaxing however we did not get a chance to use it.We did park at the hotel during our stay. In/out privileges. Fee paid at check out. 7,50 a day. The parking is a bit tight but manageable.The hotel is family friendly. The staff are great. The location is good.The towels and bed linens are good quality and comfortable. Pools towels are also provided. No furniture on the balcony or line to hang wet towels or bathing suits.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4
Hotel dos Templarios,muttibey,752,muttibeywrote a review Jul 2022,"I think it is one of the few decent and attractive hotels in Tomar. Old fashioned and rustic decoration from top to bottom. It has a decent pool and a bar to drink. Plus, the breakfast was more than enough for any reasonable person. Staff veas very professional and friendly.",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,4
