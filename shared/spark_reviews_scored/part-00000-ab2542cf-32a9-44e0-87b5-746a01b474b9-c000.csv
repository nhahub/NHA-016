Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,jonspeyer,89,jonspeyerwrote a review Jul 2014,Other than the hydro pool being as cold as a mother in laws smile we found the whole experience damn good indeed. The rooms were very well presented and the equipment was in fine order. The finish everywhere was very good and to walk out to the garden area and then the pool was particularly appreciated by my daughter who thought that was great fun.Breakfast was tip top even though after maybe a week you would get a bit tired of the sameness of it.Watch out for the massages as they are expensive in my opinion so negotiate a price before you lay on the couch.The position of the hotel is first rate and there are two v good restaurants at the beach which is close by.Overall the Belmar was enjoyed....shame about the hydro pool so watch out if you go early May !!,Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,3
Hotel Madeira,pammiejean2,45,pammiejean2wrote a review Sep 2011,My husband and I and another couple stayed here for a week in August. The hotel was very good. all staff friendly and helpful and the rooms lovely and clean. It is located over the road from the Municipal Gardens. We even had a parking space reserved at a nearby carpark. The only negative has been mentioned before - breakfasts were the same every morning but as far as I was concerned these were more than adequate. if I were to return to Madeira I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again.,Sep,2011,Sep 2011,2011-09-01,2011,4

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Ksenia V,75,Ksenia Vwrote a review Oct 2012,"The hotel is situated in a wonderful place not really close to the city center but it's really a plus cause you have a nice clean and not over crowded beach near by with 2 places to have a drink in the afternoon. The check in was so perfect (thanks to the guy on the reseption) that the stay used to be really nice. But what you will face here if decide to stay...- \"dnd\" table on the door will not stop housekeeping to ring the door and then to come in with out any urgent reasons for that or to come in the room few days later without any rings or knoking;- food in the restaurant will be nice, but guys there leave you to serve wine by yourself or may ask you to move to the bar as they start to clean restaurant before close time;- you will not find matches all over the hotel;- you'll be given shampoo only once upon arrival and even for extra pay you won't get the extra bottle;- some lights, bidet in the room or some other trifle will surely not work;- reseption guy on the request to make a booking in the restaurant will ask you to call the restaurant by yourself from the room;- and in spa most of the devices will not work.So this is Belmar as it is... Unfortunatly.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,3

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Mike T,270,Mike Twrote a review May 2017,"We stayed here for 3 nights in the past week while on a city break in Lisbon and thoroughly enjoyed the Valverde.The location of the hotel is great - right on the Avenida da Liberdade which means that you can easily walk to all the central locations but it's also opposite the metro stop which you can then combine with Lisbon's very easy public transport network of metros, buses and trams to get you anywhere in the city.Reception was great - Miguel was there to greet us and it all worked very well despite us arriving late due to a plane delay.We had a classic room so facing away from the avenue and we really liked it - very well appointed, all the facilities you'd require and a really good bathroom there too. It was nice and quiet and made for a good night's sleep.We had booked dinner in the restaurant but our delay meant that we'd arrived very late but the staff were great and we got some food sitting out in the courtyard area so, while we never had full dinner at the hotel the service and food (and wine) that we did have was excellent.We also ate breakfast in the hotel - again, excellent service with a good buffet and then a selection of fresh egg dishes. A very nice place to sit and have breakfast.We left after a great short stay and the hotel helped us again in making an early start and getting over to the train station.I'd thoroughly recommend the Valverde to anyone looking for this type of hotel in Lisbon and I'd happily stay there again in the future - it's a lovely place to stay and the staff especially do a great job of making it special.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,5
1908 Lisboa Hotel,glaikit_wean,0,glaikit_weanwrote a review Jun 2022,"What a great Hotel. Even at this busy time (it was the Festival of St. Anthony – sardines everywhere) the busy staff still went out of their way to help.Andre, Caterina and Joanna elevated this hotel.We arrived early so we left our luggage – Caterina moved it to our rooms when they became available. What great service! The included breakfast (served by Joana) was healthy and abundant.Andre helped with directions and helped us manage Portugal during a two-day festival (he suggested we visit LX Factory – glad we did not miss it)Many of the hotels we stayed in on our trip to Portugal, suffered from form over function - they would look modern  and sleek but there would be nowhere to hang your towel nor a shelf for the soap – little, but practical things. Happily, this hotel 1908 Lisboa had been both well designed and thought out – it looks good, and everything works….The smallish but functional rooms were modern and decorative with all the functionality you need, a shower that wets you, somewhere for toiletries and enough plugs for any modern charge-aholic.Couple this with the attentive, friendly, and fun staff and you have hotel we recommend",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,5
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,ShezzaH,27,ShezzaHwrote a review Oct 2023,"This is a 5 star because of the building which is full of serene crafted spaces. If you like the architecture of Mies Van der Rohe or Alvaro Siza you will enjoy this hotel. Built in the late 90s it’s a wonderful integration of a modern building with two existing old buildings on a dramatic cliff above Ponta Do Sol. Yes, I could say our room was not 5 star and needed some refurbishment but you cannot escape the mood the building creates with its spartan modern interiors facing the horizon. Absolutely wonderful. Will go back a third time.",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,5
"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",glamslam,17,glamslamwrote a review Aug 2018,"The Pine Cliffs Resort is really an amazing resort. The rooms were new and beautiful. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with our 3 adult/teenage children (22, 19 and 16). It had a full kitchen, washer/dryer, dining room and living room with a sofa bed. There were 2 full bathrooms too. The terrace was huge and had nice furniture to lounge around in. We had what they called a resort view but we really looked mainly at the parking lot. The spa was very nice but the consensus about the massages were that they were average at best. We enjoyed playing tennis and golf, biking around the property and using the fabulous exercise room. The indoor pool and jacuzzi were stunning and that's besides for the 8 outdoor pools and the beach. It is a beautiful beach that is accessed directly from the hotel down an elevator and then down many steps. The sand is soft and there is a restaurant and lounges for hotel guests. My kids also enjoyed watersports at the hotel. There was a schedule of activities every day for kids and adults. The scenery of the pine trees and the cliffs (hence the name Pine Cliffs) was simply breathtaking. Most of all I felt that this resort had a very laid-back, friendly and informal vibe that really added to my relaxation. I would love to return here.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4
Quinta Nova Winery House - Relais & Châteaux,MarleneP,12,MarlenePwrote a review Oct 2015,"I had read the reviews of this location and really thought the last one was so negative that he must just had had a attitude.  I am sorry to say that I have to agree with some of this person's concerns.  There is no arguing in the least that this is one of most beautiful places I have ever stayed.  The location, the pool, the outside/inside seating is so wonderful.  However, that is where the perfection ends.  Our welcome was very lackluster.  The lady who checked us in was very disinterested in us.  As was all of the personnel we met during our stay.  We did not realize that there is no choice when ordering dinner and the chef chooses the menu for the night.  This night it was duck.  It was fine but nothing special.  It took almost 2 hours for them to bring it..  The table sitting next to us, were served and done before we ever received our main course.  The wait staff were totally disorganized.  Not sure if they were new, but really did not seem to know what they were doing.  We had stayed at posadas throughtout Portugal and were treated to just the most amazing attention, beauty and service.  I guess we took this for granted as we certainly did not receive this here.  I think the most disconcerting thing was that, I assume they read the reviews of their location, that they have seen the negative comments on service, and they really don't seem to care.  By all means visit this location for the abosolute beauty, but do not expect more.",Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,2
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Pascale,7,Pascalewrote a review Apr 2017,"I didn't stay at the hostel but I was able to join two of their tours which I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend. The staff was very welcoming when I came to reception and I gotta say the hostel looked really nice, clean and modern.The Fado tour started with a lovely home-cooked meal at Alfama Patio Hostel. It was delicious and the lovely cook sang some Fado for us. Then Ze told us about the history of Fado and took us to a Fado house. The upstairs room was pretty much reserved for us, we got more petiscos and wine and three fado singers came to sing for us, accompanied by two guitarists. I had a really lovely night.The Street Art tour really surprised me. I had already seen quite a bit of Street Art when walking around Alfama/Mouraria and LX Factory, but Ze mostly took us to places far from the city centre and up to the surburbs that I would never have found on my own. And I couldn't believe the amount of street art there's in Lisbon, it's never ending and it's amazing work! Ze is clearly a fan of street art and very knowledgeable. And towards the end of the tour, one of his contacts told him that artists were in the process of painting 5 buses in another location so he took us there as a last minute addition!Obrigada Ze for giving me a taste of Lisbon's culture through traditions and modern arts!",Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,4

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Katherine M,0,Katherine Mwrote a review Oct 11,"As a sometimes solo traveler it is important for me to feel comfortable in the places I stay. I arrived to the hotel after an especially frustrating journey and Andre, at the front desk, greeted me with a warm smile and made me feel right at ease. In my room I was welcomed with a local sampling of their renowned pastry, Patel de Mara and local cherry liquor. The included buffet breakfast in the morning was delicious and the choices were plentiful! Staff were friendly and helpful whenever I had questions (or asked for more of the complimentary cherry liquor lol). The bed was comfortable, the rooms clean and although I faced a busy street, had sound proof shutters that opened up to a pleasant balcony to let in the fresh air. Walkable to many sites, otherwise very accessible to public transportation or Uber. Overall, a very pleasant stay.",Oct,2025,Oct 2025,2025-10-01,2025,4
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,mo883,43,mo883wrote a review May 2014,"We have just returned from our 5th golfing holiday to Dona Filipa and San Lorenzo which has been hugely successful.The hotel’s public areas has been extensively refurbished to a very high standard which is a mixture of Portuguese and contemporary design.Some rooms has been refurbished with the remainder due to be complete in a few months. The rooms we had were of the old deign but still good, very clean and well presented.The staff are very welcoming, helpful and courteous.On this visit we sampled the Fisherman’s Buffet which is held on Sunday evenings in the terrace restaurant overlooking the pool. There was a big selection of seafood dishes both hot and cold and also beef and pork carved order. I would thoroughly recommend it. The hotel operate a voucher system where meals can be purchased in advance reducing the cost to dine in either restaurant.The hotel’s breakfasts are fantastic especially the omelettes which are cooked to order.We played golf at San Lorenzo which was good but needs some attention to the tee boxes which had uneven and course grass. Still a great course which is a fair test to golfers of all abilities.In summary:Greatly refreshed Hotel in great location, serving good food by good staff.San Lorenzo still one of my favourite courses that needs some TLC.",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,4
PortoBay Liberdade,Emwhitbeck,20,Emwhitbeckwrote a review May 2015,"The Porto Bay hotel is chic and cosy, with a very agreeable spa, pool, and a rooftop bar on seventh floor with outdoor sofas. It's a 10 minutes walk from the historical city centre Chiado as well as Barrio Alto, so it's perfect both if you want to chill at the hotel or spend days sightseeing. My boyfriend and I stayed in a double. Spotless room with comfy queen-size bed and en-suite bathroom (btw the glass door that seperates bathroom from room doesn't have a lock). Very cozy overall, perfect for couples, and perhaps less so for families as chic and quiet atmosphere. Didn't test the breakfast as it was an additional £20 per person, and you can get a very large continental brunch for that price at any outdoor terrace cafe in the city centre.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Celso F,48,Celso Fwrote a review Feb 2019,"I stayed five days at the Lisbon Marriott last January. I chose an executive room with executive lounge access. The room was extremely comfortable and the services were also typical of a good Marriott hotel. The rates are just fair and the hotel is no more than a five or   ten-minute Uber ride to most Lisbon areas. It is a quiet, comfortable , charming hotel for you to rest after a busy day walking around Lisbon. My favourite shopping, Colombo, is quite near and the airport is within easy reach. I recommend this hotel for those who already know Lisbon very well like me, so that you can rest and be within minutes to any part of the city. I would like to praise and congratulate the staff, from the porter (Sergio) to the waiter  (Miguel) at the executive lounge for making my stay a very comfortable and pleasant one. Highly recommended!",Feb,2019,Feb 2019,2019-02-01,2019,5

Four Seasons Fairways,MadameSerpent,15,MadameSerpentwrote a review Jan 2014,"This was our first visit, and it was very nice indeed. It was too cold to use the pool, but most of the time it was warm enough to sit on the terrace at night. The villa was clean, spacious and well appointed. The master bedroom had a full en suite with whirlpool bath, TV and door onto a private courtyard. There was another double bedroom with en suite shower, bidet, WC etc. There was a separate shower room and WC. The biggest bedroom had two single beds but no en suite. It had doors onto the terrace. The decor of this room, out of character with the rest of the villa, was somewhat dull and sombre. There was efficient heating for cool days. The kitchen and laundry were well equipped with good quality appliances - the only quibble was there were no containers for storing opened food in the fridges, nor were there any basins or bowls for cooking. Internet access was patchy. Out on the terrace it was non existent, and indoors it varied. The staff were pleasant, nothing was too much trouble, and the whole atmosphere was welcoming.",Jan,2014,Jan 2014,2014-01-01,2014,4

Villas D. Dinis Charming Residence Adults Only,Julianne,5,Juliannewrote a review Aug 2017,My boyfriend and I are doing a trip around Portugal and Lagos was our first stop. We didn't really plan getting here from Faro airport but I would recommend booking a shuttle as it cost us  €100 by taxi. Upon arrival the gentleman at the main reception was very welcoming and showed us to our room which was in the next villa over. The bathroom was clean and modern with a rainfall shower head. The bed was comfy and the AC was much appreciated! We had a small fridge to put things in and there was a fantastic balcony over looking the pool. The main centre of lagos is only about a 10 minute walk and there is a convinient store 1 minute from the complex but also a Spar store about 5 minutes away. There wasn't any need for a car but we admittedly didn't do any sightseeing here. I would highly recommend this place and could not have asked for more!,Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,5
Royal Savoy Hotel,SuzieL,15,SuzieLwrote a review Nov 2013,"I was one of those guests burgled in August and have remained quiet on trip advisor, until now.  I have been to the RS for the past three years and have loved every minute of it and am not a timeshare holder, although know someone who is.  7 rooms were burgled on the same floor whilst all the guests were out for the evening and they stole jewellery, cash and electronics from the safety deposit boxes (in fact they removed them entirely).  The RS have offered little in compensation for the losses, which are significant and are ignoring their duty of care to their paying guests. The Savoy chose to provide neither adequate security nor any contingent liability cover in the absence of adequate security. Therefore they are not insured for guests placing items of value in these boxes - so do not take anything of value with you!  I agree with a lot of the reviewers, you can see that the costs are increasing and corners are being cut in terms of security and general lapses that a few years ago did not exist.  They are selling this as a home from home, but it is starting to look tired in comparison to newer versions.  However, you cannot complain about the view, the position or the pool area, which are all fabulous.  It is just a shame that the management are more concerned about commercial outcomes and not customer service or customer relations, which has blemished my view on the company as a whole.  I will never go back until these issues are addressed.  I know this is my own personal experience and not the general view, but I do feel that when things are great, all is well with the world, but when things go wrong, it is the customer that always suffers.",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,1

Royal Savoy Hotel,PRLBirmingham,74,PRLBirminghamwrote a review Sep 2012,"It was our first visit to Madeira/Porto Santo.  We stayed in 3 hotels: 3 nights at the Royal Savoy in Madeira, 2 nights at the Pestana in Porto Santo and finally 2 nights at the Vine in Madeira.We chose the Royal Savoy as a more traditional hotel and a contrast to the Vine, which we had scheduled a stay at later in the week.This is a hotel which is mainly timeshare apartments. It is about a 15 minute walk from the centre of town and a 25 minute cab ride from the airport.The hotel had emailed us a few days previously us to ask what time we would be arriving so they could ensure our room would be ready.  We told them 1.30pm, which they acknowledged. We thought was a nice touch.  However, on arrival our room was not ready and we had to wait until 3pm! Clearly the hotel management and the housekeeping team are not on the same page.  The rest of the check in was pleasant enough.We had a superior suite with ocean view and an adjoining double with ocean view for our 17 year old daughter.  The rooms were a nice size; we had a kitchenette and complimentary water, sparkling wine, Madeira wine and Madeira cake.  The suite had a separate sitting room and a good sized balcony.  The decor was a bit dated but a lot of the guests are older so it may suite their clientele.  The internet connection (which you have to pay for) is abysmal.  On the whole, I thought the rooms were pleasant enough.The restaurant lets the hotel down, presumably because most of the time share guests are not interested in eating there.  Breakfast and lunch are good but I would definitely avoid having dinner there. Apart from the food served at dinner, the hotel lacks atmosphere and is not somewhere we felt we wanted to spend the evening.  If you turn left out of the hotel and walk 5 minutes up the hill there are plenty of cheaper and better places to eat, although it is all average fare.Overall, I think the hotel is fairly expensive for what it has to offer.  I would put it in the average to good category.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,3

I believe this is underway in some rooms.Staff were very efficient and helpful and everything worked perfectly! Free wifi if you join their Discovery Club which is completely free. You can have a free English paper every morning too which was a nice touch. Only bugbear was the price of the evening buffet meal in the hotel which we had on our first night as we were too tired to walk into town. We were charged €30 per head ( including our drinks) and we didn't feel it was particularly great quality food for that price especially at the current exchange rate! Lots of great restaurants in town however - an easy 10 minute stroll away.All in all a real success and I would recommend to anyone wanting a relaxed couples/family holiday in a beautiful setting.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4
Saccharum,sophiekatasi,1,sophiekatasiwrote a review Apr 2022,"Just wow. Incredible hotel. Fantastic views, facilities, rooms, breakfast and staff. Cannot fault this hotel. Only downfall is that everything is extra. To use the spa is an additional €20 per person per day - a bit steep but the facilities are good and very relaxing. To play squash inside the hotel is €15 but was super fun.We did not eat dinner inside the hotel as there are about five restaurants on the beach front which is less than a five minute walk. These restaurants were all great too! Little supermarket about five minute walk away from the hotel too.Bathroom in the bedroom has a separate shower and toilet. Shower does not have a door if you prefer your privacy.Overall a fantastic hotel and I would definitely return!",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,5
Palacete Real Companhia do Cacau,Fernando C,2,Fernando Cwrote a review Sep 2017,"We really enjoyed our stay at Palacete da Real Companhia do Cacau!Montemor o Velho is a beautiful little town in middle Alentejo, very peaceful and with beautiful old houses. You can easily spend two or three days exploring the castle, the city centre, and the surrounding areas. The food and wine are great, as everywhere in Alentejo.And then Palacete da RCC. It's a recently refurbished old house, well in the centre of Montemor, but very peaceful and quiet at the same time. The pool and surroundings are really enjoyable, and there's a small fitness area where you can do your morning workout so as to better enjoy the great breakfast.The room was very pleasant, with high ceilings, contemporary design, and constant attention to detail. A small middle afternoon lunch is served by the swimming pool with wine or juice. You can see that the owner and staff do care, and want to provide the best stay. Not to forget the great chocolates, and interesting visit to the small factory.Of course if you are looking for a big metropole and a 6 star hotel this may not be the right place, but you can tell that just by looking at the map ...",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

A little rest and relaxation is what we were looking for and we found it here. We were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking the pool/ocean. Service was good, the weather perfect, hot and sunny and the choice of the beach or the good sized pool with pool bar. Walking distance to the marina where you have a multitude of choices for restaurants, shops and nightlife. I would definitely go back.",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4

Emerson Mendez was the best member of staff on the whole resort from my experience and he looked like lil uzi vert he worked at the on-site Italian restaurant! also the entertainer from Cuba (male with bald head donâ€™t know his name) every other member of staff on this resort was very very very rude",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,2
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Debdawson5,3,Debdawson5wrote a review May 2024,"During my current stay with my daughter, there was someone who pooped in the pool. To our horror, they didn’t close the pool or inform guests  allowing unsuspecting guests to swim gulping water without knowing about the brown lumps beneath them. They did bring a pool cleaner which removed the mess and added a lot of chemicals but didn’t test the water or evacuate the pool at any time. Furthermore we were not informed of the horrific noise of the construction works going on next door. Seriously not the relaxing holiday we paid for. Since seeing how they dealt with the pool incident, we’ve felt completely unsafe going in. I will never come back here as the hotel have been unwilling to listen or accept responsibility in anyway.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,1

It's also slightly away from the noise and bustle of the marina but only a ten minute walk if you wish to visit. The breakfast offered has a great selection of food for all tastes and excellent quality. I loved the freshly squeezed orange juice. The pool area is lovely and has a gorgeous breeze from the sea, but be aware there is no life guard. My only criticism was the cleaning of our rooms. It was clear that the bath and mirror in the bathroom was not cleaned or the bedroom floor which was dusty and had hair on it :(",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Quinta do Furão,Autumn leaves,388,Autumn leaveswrote a review Dec 2022,"This restaurant  and resort were recommended  by a friend of ours who grew up in the Northern Madeira  area. What a  great place to spend an afternoon  for lunch with a postcard view. Reservations  highly  recommended.  Menu is diverse and we tried the typical  regional  soup with  pork  beans, potato, carrots and rice. Absolutely  delicious  and like a stew! The couvert bread is addictive  so don't eat too much and save room for your main course.  We had the grilled beef skewers and tortellini... both prepared with perfection. We really enjoyed  every bite. Tried the pistachio  surprise which is just that!! Creamy pistachio icecream enveloped in dark chocolate.    Mmmmm.Staff were so friendly  and helpful  even though the place was buzzing. They made the experience  even better.  We loved it here and look forward  to a return visit.

Hotel Travel Park Lisboa,mastercb,0,mastercbwrote a review Sep 2010,"We stayed in Hotel Travel Park when visiting Lisbon.  We were more than happy with our choice.  Before we made the reservation, we read reviews on Trip Advisor and was a bit concerned with the issues of overbooking and noise from Metro.  But it turned out to be one of the best hotels we stayed.  The service was good.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, speaking great English.  The room was very spacious, clean, and quiet.  We also appreciated to have quite a few English channels on TV.  The location is not right in the center of actions, but quite close.  It is right off a Metro station and very convenient.  There is a grocery store close by, which was a plus to us.  However, you do need to pay 5 Euros a day to use the internet.  For what we paid for the hotel, we were happy to pay a little extra.",Sep,2010,Sep 2010,2010-09-01,2010,4
Ocean Gardens,Laura T,791,Laura Twrote a review Jun 2022,"We booked a superior bay room and had a huge king size bed and Huge corner balcony with amazing views. We absolutely loved our room. Very modern and clean. Lots of wardrobe space and a couple of comfy desk chairs to sit in.Bathroom is very modern and very spacious, walk in shower is huge! Love a separate shower, especially now 6 months pregnant. Only thing is nowhere to hang a hand towel near the sink, a couple of hooks would be sooo useful please. Also a larger shelf in the shower so not having to bend over to pick everything up off the floor would be much appreciated (the soap dish on wall is only big enough to hold 2 small bars).Room always clean and very nicely furnished, with plenty of space. We thought it quiet so slept well. If there ever was any external noise (sometimes noisy cars driving past or room upstairs dragging chairs around - please don't do this!) we just turned up the air con fan to loud to drown out any annoying background noises, but this wasn't necessary very often.No tissues in bedroom or bathroom, would be a nice to have. Standard amenities include a flat screen TV, air conditioning, a safe, a hairdryer and a small fridge. Note: there are no tea and coffee making facilities. Rooms are all non-smoking and Wi-fi is available from the room, this was always excellent during our stay which was great as mobile data signal wasn't that good in the area.We loved that our huge balcony overlooking the bay always got the afternoon/evening sunshine, very pleasant to relax on your own private the balcony in the sun after a busy day out sightseeing. We paid extra as the bay rooms are recently renovated and very modern, and the superior bay is a corner room with a much larger balcony than the standard rooms (maybe 3-4 times the size).Safe in room is free and easy to use. As other reviews, no kettle or tea making facilities in room so we bought a £6 kettle from back home to use! Useful for making pot noodles etc as didn't want to spend money eating out all the time.Although we do love our room and the views! I'm not sure I'd return to this hotel as just a bit too inaccessible. Especially with us arriving late Friday for 10 nights, meant only actually able to use hotel shuttle for half our stay, as shuttle times not made clear when booking. Public busses runs every hour during week but the at weekend big 3 hours gaps so not always very convenient. Bolt got us out of a few jams, like Uber so pretty reasonable, upto 8E to get into Funchal.Hotel shuttle bus runs Monday - Friday to Funchal 10am and 3pm, returning 1pm and 5pm. Information in hotel room is wrong - shuttle bus only running Monday to Friday, NOT weekends. In fact all bus times for weekends are difficult - with 3 hour gap in middle of day!Breakfast 7.30-10am. Pool and sun deck / Solarium is on 4th floor. The swimming pool is only small and you do not get views from the pool, but from the sunbathing terrace area nearby. The pool is freezing! Water not heated so too cold to actually swim in during April. Small sauna here too. Snack bar by pool apparently open 10am to 8pm but on our day by pool we only saw the bar being open for a couple of hours later on afternoon for drinks. Get pool towels at reception, info says 10Euro deposit required per towel! but we weren't ask to leave a deposit.Breakfast was a disappointment for us, as just not a lot of options. Another reason why we wouldn't come back, although everything else about our stay was great.There are lots of fresh breads, which I would eat with the small selection of cold meats or bacon or sausages (like hot dogs). But there were would only be 1 hot meat option a day (alternating bacon and sausages), although 2 types of eggs daily for those that eat eggs. There would usually be yummy croissants, these always disappeared very quickly but are restocked often. There was a small selection of fresh fruit (usually apples, bananas and slices of pineapple) and 2 types of cereal. There were yoghurts, some days a choice of flavours but usually only plain natural yoghurts and strawberry flavoured yoghurts too. Luckily I could nearly always make a decent meal out of bread and meat, with a little pineapple afterwards or the occasional strawberry yoghurt, and a couple of croissants saving the day, but not exactly the breakfast you dream of. The hot water machine was rarely working so my husband struggled to make himself a cup of tea on a morning, although the coffee machine was always working. The machine also served tasty hot chocolates, which I enjoyed.Staff were also polite and welcoming, the food was constantly being restocked and the tables quickly cleared and set up again for more guests. At the start of our stay it was very quiet but towards the end of our holiday it got a lot busier - as the start of the easter holidays. The buffet breakfast is served in Bellevue Breakfast Room and there are many huge windows to sit next to so can admire the amazing views.Reception staff always very friendly and helpful, giving us bus timetable and our room preference etc. Free parking is available at the hotel. In April guests still wore masks to breakfast and in reception etc, also on public transport and in taxis, in the cable cars etc - basically anywhere that you're in close proximity to others it is considered polite to do so.Beautiful gardens around the pool and terrace area. Although small there were lots of gorgeous bright flowers blooming when we visited 1st week in April. And of course the amazing views of the ocean and bay into Funchal are an obvious highlight of staying at this hotel! Beautiful views are available from everywhere in the hotel it seems. The breakfast area has long windows so you can look out at the view while you eat. Unfortunately for us, the plusses of the views and of our gorgeous room did not outweigh the negatives of the inaccessible location. (This is probably our own fault as I had relied on hiring a car after reading reviews of car hire of around £200 for week, however we booked our holiday late and by that time car hire was nearly £800 for 10 days!! so totally out of our budget, which meant we were completely reliant on buses, taxis and Bolt.)Hotel restaurant open from 11am until late evening I think, in the same place where you eat breakfast. We ate at the hotel for convenience 1 evening (as buses don't run very often on sundays and the bad weather meant we weren't venturing too far from the hotel) and 1 lunchtime when we had a chilled day by the pool. On other evenings we ordered takeaway! picked up in reception and eaten on our gorgeous balcony in the sunshine.Food at the hotel restaurant was pretty decent and service was very good. I did resent being charged 5Euro for bottled water when I asked for water though, when afterwards we heard the next table over order tap water! Just make sure you specify tap water. 1 meat skewer to share with 2 medium sides and a portion of local garlic bread to start, with bottles of water and a small seven up come to 29E, so husband rounded to 32E with tip.The views from the restaurant are spectacular, especially on the couple of days we got gorgeous sunny weather, the balcony is a lovely place to sit. Food is a little pricier than other restaurants but still not too bad as sometimes we just wanted to pay for the convenience of not having to leave the hotel; eg 12E for margherita pizza.Remember whilst in Madeira to try Bola de Caco, the local flatbread, with meals. It is basically a garlic bread as covered in garlic butter but totally delicious and we ate at most meals! Other tasty local meals included prego (steak sandwich), picado (beef stew served over chips), Espetada (beef on skewers) and fried corn. We loved the Nikita cocktail, but Poncha is crazy strong!Check in from 2pm and check out by 12pm. There is a secure room to store luggage in after checking out.Late check out, until 5pm, costs €40. I asked in advance but was told to check with reception nearer the time, 4 days before we left told not possible as fully booked. Disappointing as we had 8.30pm flight back home and I was 6months pregnant so would have been nice to rest up before flight.A little info on bus tickets:from SUBURB : The first time if you don't have a ticket you must buy a GIRO magnetic ticket from the driver for €1.95, including a 50c charge for the card. When you reach the centre, recharge your ticket at a machine. A single ticket can be bought in the bus, but a better investment is rechargeable cards, on which you load between 2 to 31 travel credits.Once in possession of a physical ticket, it can be recharged at the little stalls you see near all the bus stops at central area in Funchal, also the Horarios office and in several shops in the center, including Bazar do Povo and the tabacaria in the Sao Lourenco shopping center (where the hotel buses stop).Get No 39 bus into Funchal and back to hotel (signed for Monchal), at bus stop near central station area. You can get an up-to-date timetable at the hotel reception on request. Buses run hourly and the journey takes around 20 minutes. It is €1.50 each way once bought the ticket. Hang on when going round corners/roundabouts as saw a few people go flying! combination of crazy bends and high speeds going round corners.Eating out all adds up as it's hard to find a meal for 2 with non alcoholic drinks for under 30E, often upto 40E per meal (even lunch, unless you get burger & chips or mcdonalds or something like that). We would recommend Basmati Indian restaurant in old town for very tasty food and great value too. We even got their food delivered a couple of times plus some local portugal food delivered via local app like JustEat.",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,4
Eurostars Porto Douro,ABJ,32,ABJwrote a review Apr 2019,"This is a very nice hotel in a decent location. At first we were concerned that the location may prove to be an issue since it was at the river level and all the attractions were up several hundred feet. It turns out there is a tram about 200 feet away - of easy walking. However, you need to note that in Porto – walking can be an issue regardless because there are a lot of ups and downs. The attractions are all very close and we managed to easily get to them all in the downtown area. The hotel provides a great view from the rooms over the river and the service was excellent. I understand that parking can be an issue but we were on foot so we’re unaware of what those may be. The breakfast was decent although fairly simple – mostly continental type with some scrambled eggs and bacon. We would most certainly return.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Sheridan7,15,Sheridan7wrote a review Jul 2025,"First off - lovely staff. A really nice room, shower/bath room, separate toilet which is great idea. Loved the 19 Floor restaurant for food and drinks. The cleaning staff did a really good job with the room every day.Problems- the scent in the lobby is overpowering like really strong cheap aftershave. It gave me a headache and definitely not what you want to smell heading down the breakfast, or getting a drink at the bar. Something is also pumped into the air around the room corridors - not necessary. Just clean the place well.- The pool is nice but very small. More than 4 people in there and its hard to swim.- I got food poisoning on my last day! From the breakfast. It was pretty much instant. The manager brushed me off which was not great, but it was 100% from the breakfast. Given that I still can't eat smoked salmon or eggs it was one or both. Luckily I had asked for a late checkout but I was stuck in my room for 4 hours. Was able to eat again 48 hours later but not much.Things to consider- the location is nice but keep in mind its about an hour's walk from old town. Some of which is uphill in direct sun. (uber is very reasonable so I suggest using that for traveling around)- the beach is well worth a visit. We were told it was a 50 mins walk. It was almost 2 hours and we walk pretty fast. All in direct sun - its an open main road. Get an uber. The left is more interesting, lots of shade and greenery - the right has more restaurants, open beach, sun bathing etc.- good shopping in Porto. Got some good deals both from in old town and from a shopping centre about 15 mins walk from hotel.  The Decathlon was very useful for walking sandals, and a knee support.",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,3

The room contained everything we needed and the bed was super comfortable and spacious.The breakfast buffet wasn't huge but it contained enough variety to keep one satisfied. The staff were helpful but they did somehow manage to mess up our eggs everyday.The spa was lovely but the treatments were slightly over priced for the quality. I had a mother to be massage that was more like a rub down.The only real disappointing thing was that we only had 3 days of sunshine whilst in Lisbon and the rooftop pool was closed, the receptionist informed us that its not opened at this time of year as its 'off season' this however was not true as the pool was then opened on the 4th day. The day of rain!!Overall we enjoyed our stay at Altis Belem and would recommend it for couples, friends, business or solo travellers. The location is a little out of the way and you need to get either a taxi, train, tram, bus or the hotel shuttle into Lisbon centre.

HF Fenix Lisboa,Guilherme S,0,Guilherme Swrote a review Aug 2023,"Hello,The hotel management acts in a way that is not at all flexible in relation to its customers, with a view restricted to profit and not the well-being of its guests.There was the Pope's visit at the beginning of August, in which the center of Lisbon was closed, information in which HF FENIX had and did not pass on such information to customers who booked on the date, this was an important factor to communicate (for those who focus on the customer at least ), but as they wanted precisely the value of the daily rates without worrying about the way in which the guests would arrive at their hotel, after all, if they informed them they would lose many daily rates, so they preferred the discomfort of the guests, but the money in your cashier.When the guests disembarked, contact was made with the hotel, through the reservations sector and the manager, the two people we found informed that the hotel management had given information that was not to be flexible with any case regarding this in a short way and thick.The cancellation attempt was made because there were two women and they would have to walk 2km (about 10 blocks) to get to the hotel, they had 2 pieces of luggage each and were wearing high heels, meaning they had difficulty moving around. And yet, after requests from suppliers, they continue with the same regrettable stance.Anyone looking at this post should avoid this administration when looking for a hotel in Lisbon, as their focus is 100% on money and not on you, the guest who is here looking for information to decide on a hotel in Lisbon.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,1

The only negative if you are travelling with a family with no transportation is the distance from town. It is about a 20 minute walk. We walked it twice a day (mornings to the ferry to go to beach, and evening to go to town for dinner and drinks) and it was an enjoyable walk; it may not be if your pushing a stroller.

Legendary Lisboa Suites,sandra047,77,sandra047wrote a review May 2015,"We stayed here over Christmas and New Year and it was the perfect hotel for us.The room was a good size.A lovely balcony with table and chairs.The kitchen was fairly well equipped.A micrwave oven would have been useful.The bath room was good with plenty of hot water and large fluffy towels.The room was lovely and warm for the time of year.Staff polite and helpful.House keeping good too.There are resaurants, cafes and a Mcdonalds nearby too and a small supermarket.The free wi-fi was excellent on our tablet and phone.It was quite a walk into the city but it gives you a chance to see the city too.We would defenitly return to this hotel again.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,4
ibis Styles Lisboa Centro Liberdade NE,Relax17904,6,Relax17904wrote a review Aug 2005,"We stayed here for 4 nights (friends of ours also stayed here) and all of us were very pleased with the accommodations.It was very clean and in good shape.  Bathroom was ultra-clean and had quality fixtures.  Bedding was good quality and bed was comfortable.Room was not too big, but I don't live in my hotel room.  It's just someplace to sleep and get refreshed.Very close to Metro stop at Marques de Pombal and nice neighbourhood.  Two grocery stores just feet away and a small fridge in the room for storing perishables (or chilling white wine).No complaints.  Would stay there again (57 euros a night including breakfast)",Aug,2005,Aug 2005,2005-08-01,2005,4
Hotel Principe Lisboa,Bent Petersen,14,Bent Petersenwrote a review Aug 2011,"I think it was a very good hotel for the price. For that I mean, that we were three people straying for 75 €. I didn't expect it to be so nice, and good as it was.. Staff is very friendly ! The hotel is located just in front of a metro station, so its very easy to get there, or to get out in town. Overall I think its a very good place, I will for sure stay there again if I get back to Lisbon.",Aug,2011,Aug 2011,2011-08-01,2011,4
Hotel Fátima,traveler0605,26,traveler0605wrote a review Jun 2004,I stayed at the hotel in Fatima with my 76 year old mother in January. The hotel is very convenient. It is literally on the grounds (almost) of the complex. The hotel is not luxurious or fancy but it is very clean and the staff is friendly.  If you are making a trip with an elderly or disabled person this is probably the hotel to stay in.  The food was okay(for some reason we had a difficult time finding good places to eat in Fatima) and the hotel had a bar. There is religious articles store right across the driveway and the town is within walking distance as well.,Jun,2004,Jun 2004,2004-06-01,2004,4

Hotel Golf Mar,Scasi,7,Scasiwrote a review Aug 2023,The information about facilities for the disabled is misleading and false. After I asked directly I was informed that they do not have bathrooms with walk-in showers nor do they have a bath lift. The swimming pool has no disabled ramp or lift.  Completely unacceptable.,Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,1
Hotel dos Templarios,BSF-Lx,62,BSF-Lxwrote a review Apr 2019,"The Hotel dos Templários is ideally located in a garden right in the city centre. The surroundings are beautiful and quiet. Although not a new infrastructure, it shows it has been well maintained and renovated. We have chosen a superior room as the pictures in the hotel website showed an amazing room with large balcony. Actually the description promises a balcony in every superior room. However, ours did not have a balcony. We were shown another room, with separate sitting area from the bedroom which had two smaller balconies with a wonderful view (great to enjoy the sun in the late afternoon), but it was not half as nice as the one in the pictures. But a very good and comfortable room anyway. The bathroom is good, with very powerful shower and heated toilet rails. Wi-Fi is OK, but the TV system is in need of an urgent update, with a terrible image quality due to poor analog transmission. But to be fair, you do not go to Tomar to stay in the room an watch TV... Breakfast is very diverse, although the quality of the ingredients is a bit hit and miss. Service at breakfast is deplorable. The staff is completely disorganised, they spend a lot of time talking with each other instead of taking care of the breakfast room. In the two breakfasts I had, the plates ran out and the replenishment of food stocks was really slow. The number of waiters seems OK, but there is clearly a lack of proper management and routine which is hardly acceptable for the standing of the hotel. Another aspect which surprised me is that if you want a cappuccino you have to pay extra! Watery coffee is available in pots and expressos are included in the breakfast rate. Apart from the chaos in the breakfast room, the staff is generally very attentive and polite. The restaurant (in its own review) is OK, but you get much better price/quality options outside the hotel within 10 min walk. This could really be a \"must go\" spot for a short break or even a longer holiday, but some small details do need to be sorted out.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,3
Vila Galé Coimbra,agrawalrachit2013,9,agrawalrachit2013wrote a review Dec 2015,It's a great hotel to stay and it's near the heart of the city. Suite is pretty good size and breakfast is served with a lot of variety to choose from.From the room the forum is visible it's the best shopping mall in Coimbra. It has good spa and swimming area as well.,Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,5
