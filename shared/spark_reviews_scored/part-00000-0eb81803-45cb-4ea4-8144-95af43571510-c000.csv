Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,hdempsey,369,hdempseywrote a review Apr 2025,"I enjoy visiting a spa while on vacation and this one wasn't too far from where I was staying. Simply put my treatment (volcano scrub) is one of the best I've ever had. I'm only sad we don't live nearby!After the treatment we stayed for lunch at the hotel's restaurant.

Montebelo Viseu Congress Hotel & Spa,Leonel L,1,Leonel Lwrote a review Feb 2018,"I have been several times in Viseu in another Hotel of this Group. This time I wanted to try the 5* of the Group, and I was quite disappointed.The room honestly did not give me the 5 * comfort (compared to other hotels in this category.) Towels looked rather worn, no longer \"fluffy.\" The spare bed was rather fragile, but for a 6 year old it was still enough.At breakfast the regular cafe only is \"sack cafe\", the breakfast buffet in my opinion quite weak. When the orange juice ran out, the same was not attested, hot water for the tea was only lukewarm. Just like the scrambled eggs and the bottle sausage.Conclusion, Price / quality is not in accordance. Price yes 5 *, but the quality at most 4 *.By sure I will not make this \"experience\" again.",Feb,2018,Feb 2018,2018-02-01,2018,2

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Mark Dearman,0,Mark Dearmanwrote a review Aug 2023,"Positives:Check in was quick and easy and our cases were taken to our room which was a nice touch.The hotel is big and has a great multi sports area and the slides are also good.The staff are friendly and responsive.The rooms are big, tidy, clean and quiet during the night times (built well and no room noises coming through).The pool bar was great.The food buffet was small but actually the quality was better than expected.Drinks selection was also pretty good.The guests - this is a family oriented hotel and all the guests were respectful of that - no bad behaviour.The negatives:Main one is location. It’s a good 20 min walk to the beach or the old town.The nightclub strip which is 5 mins way is an eye sore - great if you are here to party but not so great if you are here with family. I was up running at 6:30am every day and there were still people staggering around the strip drinking and rubbish and the smell of pi@@ everywhere.The gym doesn’t have anywhere near enough equipment for a hotel of this size and only has 1 working running machine (although I told reception on the first day that one machine was broken - still not fixed 6 days later)Entertainment for teenagers was a little sparse in the evening. Only a small outside area for a singer and the indoor bar felt more like a waiting room. Needs a bit more mood lighting and music.The in-house paid for restaurants are not good enough to warrant spending additional money. They should ditch them and use those areas for something else.The pool is cold and uncomfortable even when the sun is bearing down on you.There isn’t enough umbrellas for the sun beds and although there is plenty of space, you have the same people abusing the towel reserves everyday - putting towels down and disappearing down the beach until 4pm - totally out of order and the hotel should police it and have signs up to warn that towels will be taken after say 2hrs. All Sun loungers were reserved by 9am. I was up 6:30am running everyday and towels had already been put down around the pool at that time. So be prepared.Conclusion:I wouldn’t return - the area isn’t for me. The Hotel ticks lots of boxes and would be great for younger families. Those with teenagers may find it a little limiting.They say it’s a 5 Star Plus - well it’s not. I stay in 6 Star Hotels in Dubai all the time and it makes hotel seems like a 2/3 Star. In context of other Spanish hotels of similar standard, I would say this is a lower 4 Star Hotel.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,3

After reading previous reviews regarding food, these people obviously wouldn't know a whatnot food was as the food here is fantastic. There is something for everyone. We are all inclusive and came with the idea of eating out a few night, yet we leave tomorrow and are yet to eat anywhere else. The staff have been wonderful and so helpful.

Charming Antas House,Laura Olin,130,Laura Olinwrote a review Jun 2022,"Why would you want to stay outside the city centre if you are coming to see Porto? That was my thought when I realized this hotel is in Antas. But the hotel made up for it! The spaces were carefully decorated and all details in the rooms were top class: the linen, the towels and so on. Manuela and Joao were amazing hosts who made heartly breakfasts. The last night when we needed a little snack, we got a full serving of local specialities in the garden. And yes, the Uber trips to the centre were super easy and cost between 5-10 euros for theee persons. Warm recommendations for Antas House!",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Rachel B,0,Rachel Bwrote a review Oct 2024,"This is an honest review on our experience, we had high expectations given the rating of this hotel and when we choose all inclusive we always ensure we go above 4 star for the quality of the food, which was not the case here - the all inclusive was of a 3 star standard. Whilst there was always something to eat, the food was not representative of the lovely portuguese food in local restaurants, the service eg replenishing of food was poor, drinks were ok, there was no coffee included except for instant coffee in machines, there was a lack of ice cream (only small tubs included) and slush puppies for the kids.  When we spoke to the manager about this we were told that it was value for money. I think this depends on expectations and I have definitely had better value for money in other hotels. The Italian restaurant in the hotel was shut for the end of the season and it felt as if the hotel was shutting down, which I understand it was. We didnt venture to the other restaurants which were included which could have been more authentic/better quality.  We were very disappointed by lack of fresh coffee which we have had in much lower star hotels and no bottled water except one bottle on the first day. On a positive note the outdoor BBQ was good for lunch around the pool and all the staff always served with a smile and there was always something to eat in the restaurant. I also found the food to be of a good temperature.Rooms were ok, they are a great size but again the quality is not 5 star. There was no special toiletries, they had one shower gel/shampoo for all uses, they were great for a self catered 3 star apartment and this is what I think the hotel should be rated as. We had to request some of the items eg slippers that were said to be included. It was very odd that it said there were tea and coffee facilities but no actual tea and coffee included although when I did request this it was responded to straight away (although no milk and again instant coffee).Facilities, the one thing that I think really does set the hotel above the rest is the indoor spa. Sometimes the cleanliness could have been higher, but this really was a great asset having the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room included and this does set the hotel above the rest. The outdoor pool was nice and clean, and the entertainment was good. It was a shame some of the competitions didn't have suitable prizes for kids (my daughter won the bingo but was given a bottle of wine for mum...the same wine available on the all inclusive 🤣)I would also like to positively comment on the service, whenever I had an issue it was responded to straight away. A special mention to Carlos who arranged both of my girls to have special gifts arranged for them in the room and really did go above and beyond.Locally, I would recommend the Marina for a lovely drink and food (tasca Portuguesa was lovely) and we also had a great boat ride there and saw the dolphins and caves (arranged by Carlos at the front desk).We won't be back - I don't think all inclusive is for us here, but I think if you are expecting 3 star and/or you come here self catered and enjoy the spa, you won't be disappointed.",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,3
1908 Lisboa Hotel,India,1,Indiawrote a review Mar 2025,"Super friendly staff, lovely hotel.Room was good with big bathroom. We were on side overlooking road and there was building works / traffic noise when we had the balcony door open, however once shut couldn’t hear anything! Bathroom was large with really hot waterfall shower.Location - wise it is quite near the Martim Moniz area which has a lot of single men hanging around on the streets. We were 2 women and walked around fine both during the day and at night with no issues. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Intendente metro and about a 20 minute walk from the main town shopping area. We also used Ubers which were very cheap!The staff at the hotel were some of the nicest I have ever come across, they were so friendly and helpful! Breakfast was included which we used most days - continental buffet and then other hot items such as eggs / pancakes on request.Overall staying at the 1908 Lisboa hotel was fantastic.",Mar,2025,Mar 2025,2025-03-01,2025,5

They're 1 bedroom with a very awkward bathroom separated by a glass door.  Not sure why they call them suites - they're not.

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Liz B,69,Liz Bwrote a review Aug 2018,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Valverde for 3 nights in mid-July and LOVED every minute of our stay.Upon check-in, we knew that we had found a wonderful gem.  The entire staff was outstanding, kind and helpful.  The little hotel is very pretty with a courtyard for brunch, cocktails, swimming and some entertainment (Fado was delightful).  Our room, 502, facing Avenida da Liberdade was wonderful, quiet and elegant.  The location is perfect.The iPhone provided to each guest while in Lisbon was a great touch and very helpful.   The bed was great and the bathroom so nice as well.There could be better light in the bathroom, as it felt a wee bit dark.  Only other constructive criticism was the AC, which definitely could have been stronger.The breakfast was delicious and again, each and every staff member were wonderful and one could not ask for anything better.

Captain's Log House,annchillada,0,annchilladawrote a review May 2013,"This hostel is just great!! It's not like other hostels - the equipment and decoration is very nice and special (it's all about the comic character \"Corto Maltese\"). We had a lift from the airport to the hostel for free and stayed 5 nights in the \"family room\". There's absolutely nothing to complain about! The staff is extremely friendly and you feel like being at home! There's a huge kitchen with everything you need and every day fresh fruits and chocolate in the living room. A sunny garden and a winter-garden provide enough space to relax und sit together. The Captain's brunch is amazing! You get rolls and cookies, ham, cheese, jam, honey, fruits, cereals, milk, tea, coffee, pan-cakes (recommendable!!!!), scrambled eggs - everything! They offer some bikes for free and you can leave your surf stuff in the garage. I give the advise to talk a lot to the staff - they can tell you much about Peniche, Baleal and Portugal if you're interested. They also offer you a drive to the supermarket. If you need surf lessons or wanna do yoga they work together with the Drop-Surfschool which is just a 2-min-walk away from the hostel. The beach is 5 mins away. All in all this is the best hostel! Price and offer are super - I will obviously come back some day!Greets to Zé & Sabs - you're just amazing! :-)",May,2013,May 2013,2013-05-01,2013,5

I did think in fact while I was there how you could be anywhere in the world as the carpets, paintings on the walls, general décor is pretty standard.I was here on business as it has great conference facilities and all went very smoothly (I had additionally arranged a side meeting myself) but not sure how convenient it would be for tourists as it’s roughly a 20-30 minute taxi ride into town.Sitting out in the garden by the pool or the terrace with a glass of wine is wonderfully relaxing.",Mar,2009,Mar 2009,2009-03-01,2009,4

Anyway, we were not looking for new furniture etc., but a nice, quiet and comfortable place. And that we got! Although Albufeira is a holiday madhouse  we were in between 'the Strip' and the village center itself, close to the beach, and no noise from the bars and restaurants. Both centers are about 10 minutes walk, with lots of good and cheap restaurants. Also in the vicinity of the hotel there were several good restaurants.There is a good minimarket next door, with fresh bread every morning.The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. there is a good swimming pool, with sufficient beds to sun on. Free Wifi is available in the lobby, next to the reception.To summarize, we had a good three weeks holiday for a very reasonable price.",Jun,2011,Jun 2011,2011-06-01,2011,4

Our room with river view was spacious with balcony, coffee and tea making facilities, TV, bathrobes, minibar and well equipped bathroom. The bed was about 250 cm wide. After 3 nights I pointed out the perforated bedsheet and the uncleaned balcony since moving in. Unfortunately, only the duvet was responded to and we received an apology. Breakfast rich and with lactose-free dairy products.  Wellness and sports area cost extra. Outrageously, I found a waitress who didn't dignify us in the evening. So I went to the counter to ask for salt and pepper. She then regulated that we should do this exclusively through her. Value for money not appropriate.",Mar,2025,Mar 2025,2025-03-01,2025,2

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,P D,0,P Dwrote a review Sep 2025,"Stayed in one of the two bedroom townhouses with roof terrace which I thought were good. English tv is limited i.e. one channel bbc world news. But the tv had netflix, amazon etc. Be aware that  one section of apartments is very close to the main beach road so has significant road and foot traffic going past. Noisy on occasions might bother some light sleepers. The apartments effected are on both sides of the main entrance to the hotel block E being the one on the left. Ubers are excellent. If you hire a car and intend to refuel at the petrol station at the airport we found everyone had the same idea and chaos in action.

This is one of the best 5 stars hotel that I've stayed in Portugal. Loved the room and the details with the cot, huge bed, fruit was delivered in out arrival and every day they bought candys to the room and the house cleaning even folded out baby clothes in a very cute way. The breakfast is really really good, a lot of variety, they even have traditional cake from Madeira. We have lunch at the pool bar once (a lot of vegan options) and have dinner every day (the food from the buffet was always different, starts, deserts, etc). I loved the kids room (I have a 9 month daughter, she played a lot in the pool with the slide and the little balls). the outdoor space is amazing, a lot of pools and space. The only con is that the indoor pool water could be a little warmer. Outside the hotel one can simply go to the marina and have a nice walk. Hope I can go back again soon.",Jan,2022,Jan 2022,2022-01-01,2022,5
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",RabHaErr,32,RabHaErrwrote a review Dec 2019,"Quite the institution this place. There were six somewhat snooty doormen/concierges/bellhop said when we arrived,all trying to look busy with nothing much to do. Check in was efficient but we had to wait ages for our room despite arriving around 3pm. I thought they might offer us a drink while we hung around but no such luck. 5.5euros for a tiny beer makes the bar expensive and that's one of the issues with this place; no one sits around having a drink presumably partly to do with the cost. It's like the Marie Celeste! They did lay on a cocktail evening where you got a glass of fizzy and there was a classical music evening with a free drink but other than that the place is dead. The Cliff Bay next door has a happy hour every evening and this was a better bet for sundowners. Breakfast in RP was very good apart from two days where the \"muesli\" (really a bircher) which was normally delicious, tasted as if it had fermented. We complained and fresh batch was brought but it should be made every evening for the next morning. Interesting place to see but we wouldn't go back.",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,4

The hotel as an extensive pool area with two large outdoor pools and one indoor.  There is also a sea swimming dock.  There plenty of seating and sun shades, so none of the silly bickering over pool furniture.  The whole hotel is immaculately maintained.  The rooms or suites, we have stayed in both, are excellent. The piano bar is a great place to start or end a evening in Funchal.  It has been a few years now since they knocked down the old Savoy.  Nothing much seems to be happening behind the fenced off construction site.  It is a same, because the gardens are no longer available for guests.

Noah Surf House,Nelson SdC,119,Nelson SdCwrote a review Dec 2019,"Came to this place for dinner. Service was super friendly, the waiter went out of his way to explain the hotel and concept for us, their vision on the food etc. My dad being from this part of Portugal and not into “modern food” wasn’t too amused of the place and especially not its prices. (He knows that you can eat for half the price in many restaurants in the villages around and get traditional food). The waiter sensed it and took extra care to explain to him a few things and have some chitchat to see if he would enjoy the evening nonetheless. We all ate really well, my meat was not medium like I asked but more well done apart from that it was good. Is it worth the prices they ask? In all honesty, you can eat better and for less in that area, I don’t think it’s fair asking Dutch prices in a small village in Portugal... and when you do make it incredible, and it wasn’t. To me this says: tourists can afford it, tourists are used to pay it so let’s go for it. 25 euros for the steak was even for me a bit of a tourist trap price. In the end I chose to eat there so I can’t blame them for it, hence the 4 stars",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,4

The breakfast was plentiful but only average and the supper was not great for the price.The pool was small and shallow which is fine for adults but the kids wanted more.It was quite expensive per night and we expected more for being rated a five star hotel.",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,3
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,John B,27,John Bwrote a review Feb 2015,"Booked 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza Vilamoura for 50th birthday.. Very friendly hotel, clean comfortable with good food and service. Went for Half Board with low expectations to eat out on most nights.. However that was not the case as ate in the hotel for all but one night. Although buffet for both breakfast and evening meal there was plenty of choice for both hot and cold selections, with each evening selection was different. wine waiters were helpful in choosing the plonk. For those that have not seen on the booking sites the rear direct entrance to the beach is closed at present while they build a new promenade., did not affect view, nor did it cause increased noise that was noticed. Rooms very clean and comfortable. we had 4th floor with side sea view. (fantastic view of sea and sunsets) Glass bathroom panels were novel , potentially fun for the adventurous out there. (electric blind to seal glass bathroom panel for those who wanted to be more private). Being out of season very quiet for people which we enjoyed. places we liked were The Brewery on the marina for a evening beer/wine, Akvavit restaurant - fantastic food and service, and for those with energy to burn - walk through to Quarteira and then up the beautiful sandy beach to Vale Do Lobo, where you can enjoy a drink and some food at sandals restaurant.( be aware 11km each way but worth it). Overall great break, location, people and weather. recommend to all.Bad points, The adjacent Casino is for people who like to smell like an ashtray, and the only gripe for the hotel was they also have an area near the bar area for smokers. not very 20th century.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,4
Chalet Relogio,Biancoydiaman,73,Biancoydiamanwrote a review Aug 2017,We stayed in this hotel for 10 nights. It is a historical mansion just a 10 minute (up hill) walk from Sintras city centre with great views on Castelo dos Mouros.Rooms are very clean. Some parts might need some restauration but I think that is the charm of an old building.Breakfast is simple but good with fresh products every day. There is parkingspace (if you manage to drive uphill). Staff is very friendly and helpfull.Normally I would rate a hotel of this kind with four stars.The reason for the fifth star is the very friendly service of the staff and manager.We found our room filled with snacks and drinks for the children and a bottle of wine for the adults. Every day fresh botteld water was placed in our room without charging anything. A taxi service to and from the airport was arranged and the manager called us especialy to see if we had not payed to much.It was a great stay and I can recommend this hotel to any oneThank you Jeroen and Tomas (and all other staff),Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Goughie,348,Goughiewrote a review Jun 2018,"This is still a lovely hotel and ideally situated for exploring the marina and other parts of the algarve using the local bus service which stops not far from the hotel. However, there were a couple of things this time which didn’t quite come up to scratch.Firstly the hotel management in their wisdom have decided to change the lovely rattan sunbeds with mattresses to very ordinary plain white metal ones. The funniest thing is that orders were given to change them during the day whilst people were sunbathing. One minute you were relaxing on the rattan one, the next minute you were asked to move and given a white one. Not a great move and the new ones (despite costing €200 each) are very poor in comparison to the others.We also found housekeeping to be very inefficient on this occasion. Most days our room wasn’t serviced until late afternoon and then when it was done, it appeared rushed. We were there 7 nights and I’m certain that the sheets weren’t changed throughout. There are staff falling over themselves at breakfast and yet hardly a housekeeper to be seen.There’s only one easy chair on the balcony so difficult to enjoy a pre dinner drink on your balcony as one of you has to stay inside unless you drag a chair out onto the balcony.Whilst we were there sadly we weren’t blessed with great weather so I wanted to use the indoor pool. However I really object to paying a further €11 per day for the privilege. Surely this should be included in the room rate, after all it’s not a cheap hotel to stay in.I feel like I’m doing nothing but moan but I would stay at this hotel again. I just feel that things are generally not as good as a year ago.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,3

The Metro is 20m away.  A 5 minute walk will take you to the start of the famous no. 28 tram route. The district of Alfama is also within walking distance.  Plenty of restaurants nearby the hotel.  The reception staff were marvellous! We had bikes in boxes for the Camino and they lent me tools to help assemble them. The maintenance man even got his drill to help mend a broken mudguard.  The room was high up at the back and had a lovely view of the rooftops and the castle.  The breakfast was exceptionally good with fresh fruit, orange juice and eggs cooked how you wanted, lovely Pastéis de Nata (Portuguese custard tarts).

Hotel was clean and most staff were freindly except for one recpetionist (Aida I think!) she was really rude. Breakfast was good. Had a pool facing room that was in the sun, half the hotel was mainly in the shade so you would need to specify. No tea/cofee making faciliites inthe room so take a travel kettle if you need to. Room service was good too. I woud say that the hotel is suited to the more mature traveller but can imaging there being more families and younger people earlier in the summer. The shops in Tavira were pretty much closed on Sundays - I asked at reception on Friday and was told they didnt shut n sundays so was unable to return and buy things I had seen earlier in the week on my last day.

It was easily the most scenic, beautiful part of our entire trip. The staff was incredibly friendly, the room was beautifully designed and very clean. Every meal we had at the restaurant on the property was delicious. We took advantage of the free bikes and rode them through the olive grove. The next day the front desk fixed us up a picnic and we took it to the oldest olive tree on their property. There was a family of cows sitting in a field across from us as we ate. We also each took a horse riding lesson with Ricardo. My husband enjoyed the sauna for an hour afterwards.

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,CaliforniaMuppet,27,CaliforniaMuppetwrote a review Oct 2024,"I fell in love with this hotel because of its online photos overlooking the river but in reality it was somewhat of a let down.  The location was good for wandering around the waterfront of Belem but crossing over the railway meant a long walk in either direction.  The contemporary furniture and furnishings are in need of an update and the Deluxe Balcony Room was in need of some TLC as things chipped and/or not working.  The sparse furniture (2 chairs and one small chaise) were uncomfortable.  The outdoor balcony was an enormous deep space with two uncomfortable chairs and a metal sunshade (which could not be moved) hiding the view of Belem Tower.  Despite requesting a quiet room we were still disturbed by train noises until the early morning.  We were not given any information about the pool, restaurants or spa services upon check in.  Also in the outdoor Gastro Bar our credit card was charged in US$ plus a E5 \"service surcharge\" added for this - all without asking us.",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,2

Buffet breakfast is good with a wide selection to suit all tastes, the bedrooms were very clean and tidy and excellent work by the staff who look after the guest bedroom, always happy and cheerful. Overall the Hotel is excellent and in a good position to use as a base, if I have any criticism it is about the expensive cost from the bar and the lunch bar menu is very bland with very limited items and again quite expensive, but all round this is a good hotel which is clean and tidy, a most enjoyable stay.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,4
