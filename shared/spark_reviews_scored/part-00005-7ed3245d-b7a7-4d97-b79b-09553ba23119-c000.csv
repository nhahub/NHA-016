Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Ann M,1,Ann Mwrote a review Oct 2022,This is a lovely place. Our apartment was very spacious with a nice terrace. None of the pools were heated so that was a bit of a disappointment. The complex is large so when booking you need to ask exactly where you’ll be. The garage parking is very cumbersome and confusing. The location is a short distance from the beach. There are 2 restaurants near the beach but no other restaurants to walk to.Suggestions where to eat and shop (other than there) we’re not given.The jacuzzi was nice although the water wasn’t that warm.,Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Cabarnacus,2,Cabarnacuswrote a review Oct 2020,"Nice hotel and friendly staff. Dinner service began at 7pm which is much too late for younger children. Snack bar is on offer until then but food quality was not very good and there was no variety from day to day, Burgers, chips and hot dogs. This was our only issue with the hotel. If they fix that this place is very difficult to find fault with.",Oct,2020,Oct 2020,2020-10-01,2020,3

Herdade Da Matinha,Chris S,1,Chris Swrote a review May 2015,"I've been going to Portugal for over 40 years, having been brought up near Lisbon till the age of 14, and having alternated my visits between Estoril and the Algarve.What have I been missing?Well, the Alentejo is Portugal's jewel in the Crown. Why? It has beautiful beaches, authentic and unspoilt villages and it's not been commercialised.This country retreat is the perfect spot to unwind and just be waited upon, eat great fresh food, see real nature, go for walks - do anything you want. The facilities are stunning, the people of Matinha are warm and offer superb service.My wife, sister, and brother in law were all getting over a family bereavement and could not have chosen a better place for our visit.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,5

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Negar S,0,Negar Swrote a review Jul 2022,"This was a perfect location in Lagos. The market was close, beach even closer, several restaurants nearby. The only down side is there is only one restaurant at the Belmar itself- but you have a full kitchen and many sweet local restaurants to get take-out. The pools were awesome because each area had their own- and one main pool area with both a large pool and a kid pool so you could always find space and avoid crowds. The main pool had a bar and food- which was lovely. The staff were helpful. We lost hot water one day and they sent maintenance that day to fix it which was great. Would definitely go back. Lagos in general is a fantastic place to be in the Algarve.",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,_.or.x,8,_.or.xwrote a review May 2022,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from a week all inclusive at Jupiter, we booked last minute, 3 weeks before with Jet2 and so pleased with the good value for money!Highlights for us were beautiful room, tidied daily, fresh towels bed made etc. Bottle of Prosecco was bought to our room on my birthday which was a lovely touch.Location is 5 mins from the strip which was easy to walk to for 1/2 drinks and come back to the hotel. Beach/ old town 10 mins on the free hotel bus which runs from 09:30/ 17:30. It’s €10 in the tuk tuk if you go of an evening, we used the bus quite a times during our stay.Reception staff and staff in Portuguese and a la carte restaurant especially were really friendly. Carlos from reception is lovely are helped us with booking into the 2 complimentary meals in the restaurants and moving a trip to a day with better weather. Nothing was too much to ask.Pool areas are specious, lots of beds, pool bars close by.Rooftop bar was gorgeous of an evening when the sun is setting.Spa was great on our rainy day, around €10 pp for an hour which was more than enough time.We had a 3 course at the a la carte and the steak was unreal. 3 course meal at the Portuguese restaurant was also lovely and the restaurant staff knew it was my birthday (from checking in were assuming as we didn’t tell them) they brought over a dessert and sung which was really nice. When we checked in we were really informed about these complimentary meals and we loved them so ensure to book in, the restaurants book up quickly.We liked that you could have every drink we asked for as some hotels can be funny with local spirits/ cocktails etc.Buffet restaurant was fairly busy no matter what time of day we went we would definitely return to this hotel but probably later than April as the weather was a little cloudy and windy but not as late as July/ August as I can imagine meal times to be chaos. Did find ourselves going for the same things some days but wasn’t an issue.Earlier you get up for breakfast the better as most mornings beans were freezing, eggs were watery. 8ish it’s much nicer and warm.Lots of choice in the buffet, dinner time is the best meal, especially the fresh pizzas and salads. Would recommend a light breakfast and save yourself for dinner.Wish the reception staff member who checked us in explained meal times, spa/ pool, lifts etc to us a little better but wasn’t a major issue we were fine 1/2 days in.We had a lovely stay and we return as Jupiter is perfect for families and young children.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,AliHWatford,85,AliHWatfordwrote a review May 2012,We stayed 5 nights in the 3 Bedroom appt.  Firstly the staff were very welcoming and could not do enough for you.  The standard of the appt was amazing with everything that we could possibly want.  The spa area was excellent very clean with excellent facilities.  It was quiet but more people arrived by the weekend this meant at times we had the pool areas to ourselves.  We did not try the restaurant not for any particular reason just it was nice to walk out in the evening or get a taxi to Lagos.  Would thoroughly recommend the two restaurants down the hill Campimar and Antonio.  The only negative was the the Jacuzzi did not work the whole time we were there and that would have been a treat as it was partly outside.,May,2012,May 2012,2012-05-01,2012,4

Lisbon Destination Hostel,Ping L,496,Ping Lwrote a review Jan 2019,"For the newbies that have never stayed here before, upon reaching the Rossio Train Station, kindly make your way to the escalator and travel to the top floor, and that's where you are going to see the Hostel.We truly didn't expect the personable service.  Pedro, the front of house came over to shake our hands and led us to our room.  The highlight was the view from the room, that looked straight to the Piazza below.  Being Christmas time, there were fairy lights everywhere and streets were bustled with commuters that were in jovial and celebratory mood.Entrance to your room was via card system.  Unfortunately, our lock was damaged and Pedro could only do his best to give us a temporary fix, which was perfectly fine.Breakfast here was surprisingly sumptuous.  WiFi was very good.  There were many programs on offer to bring people together.  The only bummer to our stay there was the ratio of the bathroom wasn't high enough for all of us, and so, you would need to plan yourself accordingly to use the facilities.For those of you that wish to go to Sintra for a day trip, the train station is right in front of your door step.  You needn't worry about not knowing how to purchase the train ticket as the front office was very helpful and informative,   On top of that, Libson Public Transport also engaged personal assistants at certain hours to assist newbie travellers or tourists such as us.Lisbon Destination Hostel lives up to its high rating.  It exceeeded our expectation and more.  It's well priced, friendly, and truly a good start for you to put a smile on your face for your Lisbon travels.Highly recommended.",Jan,2019,Jan 2019,2019-01-01,2019,4

Pestana Vila Lido,Thomas L,0,Thomas Lwrote a review Aug 2024,"We had a suite facing the sea with an exceptional view. Unfortunately if you are a non-smoker, you collect smoke from neighbours who smoke on their balconies. We can't keep the windows open because the smoke gets into the room. Very little hot water in the shower, it's okay l tte, but it's limit for a 5 star. Forget about the breakfast box at Check-out (before opening breakfast), no excuse from the receptionist... very long service at the pool restaurant. In short an exceptional location, but very average performance for the Award.",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,4
PortoBay Serra Golf,Almerinda F,0,Almerinda Fwrote a review Oct 2024,"My stay at PortoBay Serra Golf was a true romantic haven. Cozy, with an intimate atmosphere, where every detail seemed made to embrace us, even under the rain. That good rain, which invites to tranquility and brings a special charm to the environment. The staff, always attentive, made us feel at home at every gesture, and the warm pool was the perfect invitation to relax. In the room, everything breathed comfort, from the cosy bed to the decoration that transported us to a place where time seems to slow down.",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,5

Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,Natalie A,16,Natalie Awrote a review Jul 2011,"We are four girls traveling through Europe at the moment. We discovered this hostel through hostel world. It was the first place we looked at in Lagos so we went ahead and booked it.We all really enjoyed our time at the hostel. Aside from the basics; clean spacious rooms with ensuite, free wifi, big comfortable common room with plenty of couches and bean bags and TV, a large swimming pool and BBQ area... the hostel really has a great vibe.The people who run it are all really relaxed and become your friends by coming out into town with you for dinner or drinks or organizing BBQ nights at the hostel.The hostel also offers surf lessons on the west coast which are not compulsory but a great added extra. I had never surfed before and I had such a fantastic time! They also provides lunch on these days an all equipment.If there were any drawbacks the only one would be the location depending on your intentions. It is about a 5-10 minute walk into the centre of town however this suited us perfectly because the neighborhood was really nice and quiet so on the nights we weren't partying we got. Good night sleep. Also as the hostel has a kitchen it is really great that it is surrounded by 3 supermarkets all within about 2-5 minute walk.Overall we loved the surf hostel and would definatley stay there again in the future.",Jul,2011,Jul 2011,2011-07-01,2011,4

Independente Principe Real,tambra W,2,tambra Wwrote a review Jun 2023,This was the absolute worst stay of my entire life.  I arrived later in the day my first day and was super tired and went to sleep so I did not notice this until the next day.  There was Black Mold in the Bathroom when I was about to get in the shower.  I had a private room with ensuite bathroom.  Black Mold does not grow overnight.  The Accomodations Manager - Manuel Forbes Bessa stated they would issue me a refund to which he emailed me and asked for my bank routing number and account number.  Who send this information over the internet in an email.  Total bogus.  So this ended up costing me double because I checked out after they did not clean room and went to another Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay far far far away from this one.,Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,1

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Susan Brown,0,Susan Brownwrote a review Jul 2025,I first visited the Belmar in 2013 and have watched it settle into its surroundings ( the plants and flowers are beautiful) and grow into confidence as a hotel where I feel instantly at home. There are many reviews referring to the lovely apartments and the fact that the beautiful Porto do Mos beach is 5 mins walk. I just want to say that the staff have always been wonderful and helpful. The Spa treatments are fantastic. My face glowed and my shoulders are now officially relaxed ! If there was anything I could ever have criticised  it was the food set up BUT wow the refurbishment of the restaurant and the pool side bar menu/ cocktails etc is wonderful to see. This is a unique Resort. And wonderful.,Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,5

Saccharum,dannyandamanda,57,dannyandamandawrote a review Apr 2022,"What an outstanding hotel, clean, bright with the most amazing staff possible. It all started badly when we discovered a passport had been left in the airport. The staff could not be anymore helpful. They spoke with the police secured the passport which allowed the trip to continue.The venue itself has the most amazing views, if you can afford it try for a full sea view, the pics do not do it justice. If you can't take a trip the view point on the 8th floor. It's stunningThe bars catered for all tastes, the staff were beyond amazing, friendly, helpful and a real happy bunchWe did a mixology class with Nicholas. It ended up being a  1 2 1 session and it was amazing. The lesson was for a full hour with the amazing cocktail tender Nicholas once again another amazing member of staff, a joy to be with.You must book a trip to the spa, it is amazing if you buy a treatment you get entry all day. It was so so relaxing. It all concluded with an amazing massage.The venue is so good the return trip is being planned to cover all the amazing things we did get a chance to doI cannot recommend this hotel and its staff highly enough",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,5

The ceiling was also great but many of the paint and ceilings had holes and stains which probably never came out after cleaning, it didn't bother me personally but you have to remember that it's a 5 star Savoy hotel. The food was always delicious and varied, unfortunately I found a snail in my salad once which of course can happen but shouldn't. The location was very good, right by the sea!The indoor and outdoor pool were also very nice and attractive. But you should be aware that parking costs €10 per night and you can't get a parking space late in the evening, I personally think it's a shame that parking on the street costs something and €5 would have done the trick.But all in all a great hotel apart from a few minor things, I would go on holiday here again anytime.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,4

The staff were very efficient at keeping the tables clear quickly to minimize delays at busy times.My only area of disappointment was the grass outdoor area where there were sunbeds and \"some\" parasols.There are many missing parasols and  50% of the ones left had broken bars on them and were a bit difficult to put up. The sunloungers have also seen better days.Not what I expected from this hotel but that was the only thing that they need to address.There is also construction  taking place on the Quarteria side of the hotel but wasn't overly noisy during our stay.",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,4

Stayed at Ampulis hotel near by about 15 yrs ago. The Crowne I couldn't remember I know it was under a different name but although an old hotel the Crowne group has done a good job of refurbishing it. The rooms are well designed and bathrooms very large. All in all a good quality hotel. Staff all very friendly and breakfast varied and plentiful. A bit disappointed on first night there was no buffet due to time of year but due to number of restaurants in Vilamoura evening food is usually no problem with plenty of choice.The only disappointment is the cost of the health club/spa. I thought that out of season they would have some sort of deal on. The hotel itself seemed less than half full.The hotel gas a great location right on the beach,coastal path. Walk out through the pool area and turn left and its 5 min flat walk to Quateria and its promenade or turn right a 5 min walk into Vilamoura.We will definitely return  next winter.",Mar,2017,Mar 2017,2017-03-01,2017,4

You cannot get a better location, beachside resort, lonely sea and close to the city centre. The tivoli hotel is close by as well.Hotel decor, it a definitely not a 5 star. Decor a little tired, carpet on the rooms floor need urgent attention... Nothing major though.Food... 4/5. There isn't much variety other than the usual steak, fish, salad etc. No Asian, Thai, Italian etc. It's like being in London all over again, anyhow, despite the lack of variety,Food did suffice.Finally customer service, 1/5. This is the only reason I would not recommend the crown plaza. When your away on holiday, staying at a hotel which you have paid a premium for, least you expect is aSmile and a nod. It felt like some of the staff had a chip on the shoulder... No idea why. We often had to make an effort ourselves to strike up a conversation. They were hardly busy, not even peak season. Yet the staff were... Unwelcoming shall I say. The chirpiest bloke was the cook and he was stuck in the kitchen all day everyday.Needless to say, plaza hotel staff need to brush up on customer service. Other than that not a badHoliday at all.Overall 3/5. Would I recommend it? ... No! Because I'm sure neighbouring hotel would offer better customer service with a smile... They must do, surely.Happy holidays!",Mar,2015,Mar 2015,2015-03-01,2015,3
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Simonsupascoota,15,Simonsupascootawrote a review Aug 2017,"Booked only a few day before visit, expensive but worth it. Well run and really ideal for beach and harbour. You could always get a sunbed. Ask staff if you need help to get one. Breakfast excellent. Rooms can't fault. Was puzzled when reading room description beforehand as said shower only in deluxe room, but had excellent bath. Will go again as very convenient from uk and no riff raff, just good restaurants at acceptable prices. Had a trip to albufeira which must have been lovely 40 years ago! 10 days was just right for first visit. Lovely for a short break also.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,chrisjhorsfield,18,chrisjhorsfieldwrote a review Jul 2016,"The location of the hotel is perfect: close to the riverside and the ferry jetty, and a short walk to the Roman Bridge. The breakfast was superb. We don't usually like buffets but this was beautifully presented. Everything you could wish for, refreshed regularly. We never had to bother with lunch! The room was cleaned every day, and the staff were all helpful and friendly. We had a pool view and were glad. Half the rooms face inwards, towards the pool, and the other half face out to the street. We had dinner at the hotel on one evening and enjoyed it, but the range of restaurants in the town is so good that we wanted to try somewhere different each night. Our only criticism, and it's a mild one, is that some of the fittings are getting a bit tired. We would both return without hesitation.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,4
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Maralyn T,25,Maralyn Twrote a review Oct 2018,First time in Porto and this hotel did not disappoint.  The reception staff were so friendly and helpful from the minute our taxi dropped us off.  My friend and I had booked room only.  The twin room was very spacious on the 16th floor with amazing views over Porto.  The hotel has a roof terrace for hotel guests and it was beautiful to sit outside at midnight on a warm evening drinking cocktails.  Food is also served  on the roof terrace and in the dining room and I had a smoked salmon salad served at 10.45pm.  Taxis were on strike whilst we were there and once again the reception staff went out of their way to arrange for transport for us to a restaurant that we had previously reserved which was not in walking distance.  Not only did the driver drop us off but walked with us to show us where the restaurant was and gave his card to the owner so she could call him to pick us up.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to spend a few days in beauifuil Porto.,Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,5

Only positives are hotel location which is at beach and reception staff who assisted us when our return transfer did not turn up.Our room and the hotel in general is very basic and very dated. We had 1 room (Deluxe!!) and 2x one-bedroom apartments which all require refurbishment. The food was very poor with breakfast being the only half-decent meal of the day.Hotel appears to have self-catering, bed & breakfast, half-board, full-board and All Inclusive. We were on AI which is the worst we have ever experienced. This finished at 23.00 hrs with last order at 22.30?? Only allowed to use one bar, you had to pay at the others?? The drinks were only one per person and were of very poor quality.We (6 of us) would return to the area but never to this hotel.

And itâ€™s great for families: we used the beautiful pool/jacuzzi every day and helped ourselves to the outside play equipment, toys, dvds, feeding the pigs etc...

Natalie from customer services delivered a bottle of bubbly to our room along with strawberries & chocolate for our anniversary which was very much appreciated.

Yes! Lisbon Hostel,BrittyLJ,34,BrittyLJwrote a review Jan 2016,"Yes! Lisbon kind of felt like a destination in itself. I've probably seen most that Lisbon has to offer during the week I spent there, but I want to return just to hang out with the amazing staff that work at this hostel. They are super friendly, welcome you in like family and jump through hoops to make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible.The place itself is super clean, I don't think I ever saw the bathrooms messy at all and despite the huge mess we left in the common areas as we went off to bed at 4am in the morning, it was always clean when we rocked up for breakfast. Despite the fact that people are often chilling out downstairs or coming in from the pub crawl at all hours of the morning, the noise never travelled up to my room.The common area is amazing- it's super easy to meet people and there were many afternoons spent chilling out the bean bags and watching movies.The walking tours are great- especially if you get Soraria (her knowledge of Lisbon is super), as are the communal dinners which are such a great way to get to know people and also super great value (10 euros for starters, soup, main, dessert and an open bar during the meal).I'll never forget my stay at Yes!

HF Fenix Lisboa,PaoloDL,6,PaoloDLwrote a review Sep 2013,the overall impression is good but the hotel seems to suffer when assaulted by groups.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,serendipitykm,3,serendipitykmwrote a review Apr 2025,"We are so disappointed with our stay and would happily go home early. We arrived Sunday just before 5 and was checked in. Our room is in a block right at the back of the resort but does have a nice balcony and view.When we arrived I noticed the beds had hairs on them and then looked around to find dirty pots in the sink, rubbish in the bin, dirty things in the fridge and general grubbiness.  We went to reception and after much consultation they said the room wasnâ€™t finished and they would ask for it to be cleaned.  We came back 45 minutes later to find the sofa bed not made, only 2 bath towels, the fridge still dirty and had to call down again.Eventually at 7.00 we were checked in and unpacking before dinner.The all inclusive food here is some of the worst I have ever had. It is the same almost every day and nothing for vegetarians. The restaurants are barely  open and they serve a set menu. We have been going out to eat to avoid the food. The drinks are so limited and fairly awful and only available in one bar at the other end of the resort.We are right next to a club that starts at 10.00 every night until 11.00 so no chance of an early night or sleep for kids.Today we have returned to find our daughterâ€™s retainers gone. They were wrapped in a tissue next to the bed and we assume cleaned away by cleaning staff. Our next surprise tonight was a large group of teenagers moving into the block and running up and down screaming and shouting for hours.On the up side the staff at reception try their best to help but told us at check in there was no other room and sadly we need to pay for new retainers!!I would not recommend this hotel to anyone",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,1

The hotel is modern, clean and the food is very good. We didn't use the spa facilities but the roof top sun lounge is really nice and has excellent views.The highlight of our stay was being upgraded to a suite overlooking the Tejo as we had arrived early and our room wasn't ready.  Rather than having us wait they gave us the other room which was very kind and completely unexpected. We travel a lot and this is the first time a hotel has done this for us - it was a nice treat so a big thank you to the reception staff.The only (small) criticism I have is that tea and coffee aren't provided free of charge in the room, something which is standard in most hotels.

ibis Styles Lisboa Centro Liberdade NE,Guilherme Z,0,Guilherme Zwrote a review Aug 2023,"Our stay at Ibis Lisboa Parque das Nações was an absolutely unforgettable experience. As loyal members of the All Accor program, we have stayed in various establishments under different brand banners: Sofitel, Novotel, Gran Mercure, Mercure, Adagio, Ibis, among others. However, we can say with all conviction that Ibis Nações stands out as one of the best, if not the most notable, we have ever stayed at.For a couple of days we enjoyed the premium rooms and subsequently a suite for another two days. The experience in the premium rooms had already amazed us: impeccable service from all the professionals, whether at reception, at the bar, coffee service, cleaning, among others. The rooms are of a superior standard and a rich, delicious and excellent breakfast. Transitioning to the suite was the perfect culmination of our stay. Undeniably, one of the best spaces we have ever had the privilege of staying in, plus the meticulous care taken by the hotel team in providing pampering and attention for our two children.Our decision for this location was considered and is, perhaps, the only aspect to meticulously consider when choosing. Even though it is not exactly in the city center, the hotel is very close to a metro station and bus stops, making any journey easier.It would be a great pleasure and an immense satisfaction for us to return to this hotel in the near future. It is, without a doubt, a superb establishment!",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,5
Turim Marques Hotel,AlexausWien,41,AlexausWienwrote a review Nov 2019,"The hotel is modern, clean and in a good location for exploring the city. The breakfast buffet offers a lot of variety to cater for all tastes. That’s about it for the pros.A very big con for us was the fact that in the second week of November the heating was still off and the room was cold. On the first day staff at reception told us „it’s not winter yet“ and „the general management knows about the situation but hasn’t reacted yet.“ The second day we were told after breakfast that at 10am the heating would be switched on only to find the room cold as ever at 4pm when we returned to the hotel - this time the staff‘s excuse was that they were waiting for a mechanic to sort the heating out.We came to the conclusion that the Turim management seems to care more about their expenses than guest satisfaction.A word on the rooms: They are, by European standards, relatively big, but badly designed: The sink is separated from the WC/shower and integrated into the main room. So far, so good - it’s just lacking storage space- so no chance for two guests to store their toiletries there. No rack for the hand towel either, no free mineral water or amenities like slippers ... all those small things that would ensure a 4 star experience. We left disappointed.",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,3

Hotel dos Templarios,SanFran11,78,SanFran11wrote a review Aug 2013,"When we booked this hotel our expectations were not great based on the website, even though it had really good Tripadvisor reviews. As soon as we walked in we were impressed with the décor and luxurious feel and were warmly greeted at reception.  We had requested a river-facing room when we booked.  They offered us a rive view room but advised us that it would likely be loud until early morning because of a festival at that time and offered us a front room which we accepted.  We were amazed at the room.  We had reserved a superior double room and the room (310) was huge suite, obviously an upgrade.  There was a sitting area, desk area and very large deck.  The bathroom was also great with a tub and separate shower.Breakfast was okay with a good selection of rolls,  pastries and cakes as well as fresh fruit and many more choices. The pool area is great.  The rates are low given the quality of the hotel-an excellent value.Tomar is a charming town and definitely worth visiting.  Don't miss the Convento.

We had a wonderful suite (Mozambique) which could not have been more perfect. Huge sliding doors allow the entire room to be opened up with views of the beautifully landscaped gardens and the faint sound of tricking water from the amazing water features throughout the grounds. The room was perfect, light, airy, full of fantastic facilities. The main house is beautiful, tastefully decorated and giving it's guests an immediate feeling of relaxation. Breakfast was superb, simple yet perfect - freshly baked pastries, freshly squeezed juices and perfect coffee (Nespresso!) The staff are so attentive yet not at all intrusive, they can not help enough. That was October and it was superb!!We returned to Casa Vela again in late April 2014 this time with pour 18 year old daughter and having described the property to her it had a lot to live up to - it didn't disappoint! Our room was again immaculate, this time with huge bathroom and whirlpool shower. The staff were equally as attentive and again you feel like you're at home rather than in a guest house. We spent time in the lounge, relaxing on the comfy sofas with a bottle of red wine and our visit could not have been any better. The house is a 10 minute walk from the centre of Cascais (or a 2 minute taxi!) in such a peaceful area of the town. If you are looking for a comfortable break in Cascais without feel ing like a 'room number in a large hotel' the Casa Vela is perfect. We cannot recommend it highly enough and will definitely be back for a third time. Well done to all involved!!",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,5

No chargeing by the bed except 1 standard poweroutlet, placed so you have to crawl on the floor to reach it. The entire room gave an old impression.Finally did we ask to check out later then 12 as one of us woke up with a terrible migraine. They extended the check out with 1 hour. I did the double check and knew that the hotel was’nt fully booked.What was good then?- Good location if you’re visiting the city.- Easy to park close to the hotel.- Poolarea was ok but no barservice at the pool.Will we stay here again? - NopeWill we recomend the hotel to others? - Nope",Oct,2023,Oct 2023,2023-10-01,2023,2
Apartamentos Bellevue Nr. 1,AMaidment,1,AMaidmentwrote a review Sep 2008,"My girlfriend and I have recently returned from a week in Carvoeiro, Portugal, booked through Thomson/Simply Travel. We stayed in the Bellevue Apartments, on the Rue das Flores.Firstly the hospitality of the staff is excellent. The 12 apartments that make up Bellevue are managed by a lovely German couple who are so friendly and go out of their way to help you in any way they can. Our bags were carried to out apartment for us even though I was wholy capable they would not hear of it. On arriving at the apartment both my girlfriend and I were delighted with the sheer size and and quality of the aparment. We've both stayed in a range of hotels/villas/apartments over the years but this one (#12) was excellent and certainly far more than we were expecting.We were even more suprised to find complementary wine, water and essentials such as bread, butter, milk, eggs, cheese, tea, coffe etc; usually something we'd expect to ask for in advance or at least pay a surplus for such a 'Welcome Package'.The apartments and surrounding areas were exceptionally clean and tidy. The pool was well kept, cleaned daily, and held at a steady 24 degrees while we were there. Due to there being are only 12 units in the Bellevue Apartments there is a feeling of exclusivity and privacy - there is certainly no competition to find a nice spot by the pool and it was always so lovely and quiet.The apartments themselves are located at the top of the main road on which the majory of bars, restaurants and small shops reside, and was a perfect location to access everything including the beaches in either direction along the coast (5/15 mins walk) Only 5 mins walk is the ever spectaular Algar Seco - a lovely rocky coastline with hidden coves and rock pools, including a quiet snack bar hidden amoungst the rocks.From right opposite, all the way down to the nearest beach and village square there are a rangle of restaurants serving anything from traditional Portugese fayre to ever-familiar Indian and Chinese cuisine. An absolute must, however, is the fresh fish and sea food dishes. We sampled some excellent freshly caught fish, my particular favourite being Sea Bass caught that morning, which I had at the \"Restaurant de Rede\" located right opposite the Bellevue Apartments. As a traditional fishing village Carvoeiro restaurants all serve very fresh fish and sea food and it really must be experienced.The beaches are quaint and all located in beautiful rocky coves. There are 3 within easy walking distance of about 15 minutes although there are more all accesible by car if you choose to hire one.I would highly recommend the Bellevue Apartments and Carvoeiro. It was a thoroughly relaxing and tranquil experience.",Sep,2008,Sep 2008,2008-09-01,2008,5
