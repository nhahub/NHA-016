Saccharum,Catherine L,4,Catherine Lwrote a review Dec 2016,"After only two days in this hotel I reached a state of peace and tranquility rarely found in large hotels. The atmosphere was calm, quiet, stylish and restful; the Ayurvedic massage was a wonderful experience, the gym was always quiet, the rooftop pool was beautiful, and the view from my balcony stunning. The only thing that lets this hotel down is the surly staff; I had to work hard not to get annoyed with their unwillingness to serve drinks in the main restaurant and roof bar, and to communicate pleasantly at reception,",Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,nourhaddad,0,nourhaddadwrote a review Sep 2014,"This hotel definitely made my stay in Algarve perfect from A to Z. The staff at the reception are so helpful and welcoming (just like the portuguese people in general). We stayed here for a week in a very big one bedroom apartment. The quality of the apartment was outstanding, the kitchen is fully equipped with the newest appliances, the bathroom is very clean, and there is A/C in all the rooms. The apartment was fully cleaned on a daily basis, I was surprised that she even took the time to wash the dishes!!! The breakfast and dinner buffet are good, although I recommend that you check out restaurants outside the hotel during your stay in Lagos. All the hotel is very clean and the most rooms have views on the pools or the seaside. Free wifi and indoor/outdoor parking in the hotel. The wifi wasn't very strong in our apt but it didn't bother us much. The hotel isn't in the centre of Lagos, so I definitely recommend that you rent a car when visiting the Algarve, especially if you wanna visit different beaches and cities, it is the most practical way to move around. I definitely recommend this hotel for any couples or families visiting Lagos.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5

Hotel Madeira,paul b,103,paul bwrote a review Feb 2017,"I was immediately struck by the cleanliness of the Hotel and subsequently discovered this efficiency continued throughout every aspect of the premises. More adroit and proficient than home comforts, but superb value close to the promenade, bars, restaurants and shopping. Friendly service from all staff, the inclusive breakfast was adequate with hot and cold variations, the only reason not to offer 5 stars were the two intrusive signs in English on the breakfast table, warning guests not to take food out of the dining room or they would be charged ! On reflection, does this perhaps say more about the Brits than the Hotel ?",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,garryggw,3,garryggwwrote a review Dec 2015,Stayed at this hotel 12th Dec. 2015   .The older rooms which are the majority are very tired looking and old fashioned with the typical old farmhouse style furnishings.   I believe the newer upgraded rooms are much better but they are fewer in number.   The WI Fi connection is  poor and the television package is pathetic with only  3 news channels in English and the poorest reception I have ever encountered in any hotel. There is no tea / coffee making facilities in the older rooms unless you specifically request which seems strange for an hotel.  Breakfast very acceptable and fine dining average to good although a little on the expensive side for what you get for example €13.50 for a tiny portion of prawn cocktail   did not seem to be particularly good value . The staff are generally well mannered and friendly. The ground level entry is nicely presented and the newly refurbished bar area is welcoming .The golf package probably is one of the attractions of this hotel but I have to be honest in my assessment and categorically state that this is no longer a five star accommodation,Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,3

The location was perfect and we could not have asked for a better accommodation. The breakfast was lovely and plentiful, and having fresh bread delivered each morning was a treat. The apartment is fully stocked so it would be easy to spend many days there and be able to host others. The hosts were amazing and so responsive.

Luna Clube Oceano,Emily,57,Emilywrote a review Aug 2016,"Lovely holiday! We stayed in one of the apartments on the bottom floor. This was so handy as there were steps leading up to the pool from the balcony. This meant we could leave the patio doors open and nip in and out for shade breaks! The apartment was very spacious with everything you need to be self catering if you wanted. The cleaners came in every day to change your bedding. The air con was a god send! There was also free wifi everywhere in the hotel with brilliant signal.The pool area was nice. Everyday we could get sun beds and it was very quiet. We tried breakfast around the hotel in the small cafes. We didn't really rate them and ended making our own in the morning. We had dinner in the hotel. It was lovely and not overly priced! The old town was about a 15 minute walk, which was down hill on the way but a big hill on the way up, however we did walk there and back as it wasn't too bad. All in all a lovely holiday. We would definitely recommend going back.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,5
Casa Mitchell Apartments,amyokeeffe,66,amyokeeffewrote a review Sep 2019,"situated in a mostly residential area so it's very quiet, no bars/loud music nearby - ideal if you like peace & quiet - we stayed in room 74 as i heard on previous reviews that it had a private roof terrace - in hindsight we wish we had not chosen this room as it's always nice on holidays to have a balcony so that you can just step outside to get some fresh air & sit out in the evenings - i had presumed the entrance to the private roof terrace would have been IN our room but it wasn't, we had to go outside our room into the public hallway & up 2 flights of stairs to the room - the 3 mornings we were there we were laying out in the sun when the cleaner barged in on top of us & opened out the door, putting a stopper against it to hold it open, this made us feel uncomfortable as any of the people staying there could have came up there - we were also made to feel as though we had to leave the door open as the cleaner made a point of opening it - we were told however at reception during the week that the door should be kept closed? very confusing .... the pool area was very quiet, always able to get a sun lounger/umbrella etc. - however we found it TOO quiet - you could hear a pin drop - would be nice to have a pit of background music however low volume. the room was cleaned 3 times while we stayed but our bed sheets weren't changed even once while we were there ..... it it about a 4 minute walk to the nearest bar/restaurant - merlin's bar is great for drinks on the way down to the town or on the way home - eddy's bar next to it does very reasonable & tasty food, some of the nicest pizzas we ever had - it is a downhill walk to the old town so a trudge uphill on the way back up - ladies don't wear heels going out in the night time - i did the first night & it was a real struggle, i nearly fell so many times, all the footpaths, side streets etc. around the town are cobbled & the cobbles are very shiny & slippery .... the beach here is gorgeous - loads of watersports  .... the marina is a sight to behold, really worth the walk over to it - about 15/20 mins walk, the irish bar at the marina is great for food & lots of room there, loads for kids to do over at the marina - arcade games, little quad bikes, karting etc. & it's also the take off point for a lot of boat tours & trips, we were there for one night for sunset & it was beautiful - if you like the nightlife in the old town, i wouldn't suggest taking a trip to the old town, it's everything i've grown to hate about resorts over the last few years, groups of guys going around drunk in the middle of the day ogling women & intimidating people, very loutish & just didn't feel safe there (this was still early evening time), we ate had a drink & hightailed it back to the told town very quickly! definitely not suitable for families or couples wanting a relaxing holiday ..... all in all, i would recommend staying in the old town & these apartments would be ideal for a couple wanting a relaxing holiday",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,3

Independente Principe Real,sooz_h,16,sooz_hwrote a review Oct 2015,"We stayed in one of the suites in Oct 2015.  The hotel is a busy spot, there is a hostel and some rooms so it attracts all kinds of people. The restaurants there are very good - we ate there on our last night and it was one of the best meals of the week.The location is excellent - but you have to be prepared for the hills - we always walked into the city - one street away is a great street for local restaurants and FADO singers etc.. and we would get a taxi back - about €5 from the Rossio.We had a suite - which is really just a hotel room, on the top floor - where we could see the Castello de St Jorge over on the other hill. The sunsets were spectacular.Our room was fully airconditioned, which we were very grateful for as it was a particularly humid week.Everything in the building is old, all the furniture etc.. so its a real eclectic mix of things. I liked it, but it might not be to everyone's taste.Also, its an old building, so the lift is only big enough for two people as is a bit on the rickety side.Finally, our rate included breakfast, which was served in the roof restaurant in the building next door.It was served until 11am - and it was perfect, fresh scrambled eggs, plenty of cereal, breads, coffee, juices etc.I would stay here again. The location is the best.",Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,HughMc,280,HughMcwrote a review Apr 2016,"Stayed here for four nights to attend a conference at the Catholic University which was just across the road. The room was large with two double beds, a good size flat screen television with plenty of channels in English, ironing board and iron, coffee and team making facilities but no milk, a mini fridge, hairdryer etc. The room also had a balcony. The bathroom was large with a shower over a bath, hairdryer and the usual assortment of individual shampoos etc.The major difficulty I had with the room was the light in the closet which would not go off and I eventually found the switch on the light itself to do this -initially I just thought it would go off when closed the sliding doors. This was a problem for others.The hotel had a couple of shops a bar with a tapas menu and a nice lounge there was also a restaurant which also doubled up for eating breakfast. Breakfast had a wide range of options and you can purchase different breakfast packages. The hotel also has a two tier hi-fi packages whilst the high package is god enough for most things it created a problem when I Skyped.This is not a small hotel and is used by bus tour companies and for airline staff as it is close to the airport. To get a taxi down to the old town - too far to walk - was 6.50Euros and to the river front 8.50 Euros. There is a metro station 10 mins away.Overall the Marriott proved a very convenient and pleasant place to stay.",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,4

Casa Mitchell Apartments,Amanda H,158,Amanda Hwrote a review Jul 2008,"The Casa Mitchell Apartments are in an excellent location.  I think the following is essential information (bearing in mind we were in a studio apartment).Kitchen – Studio is smaller and hence the supplies are smaller.  The frying pan we had was so small it would only do one egg at a time.  We asked at reception if we could have a bigger one and was very impressed to have a brand new one shortly after.  I think this shows how flexible they are.  Our kitchen was a good size (see the picture).Bedroom – Personally I thought the bedroom was a good size (for a studio, and it was separate to the kitchen area).  My husband was happy too but he did complain that the beds were far too hard.  I think that’s quite normal abroad though (I am sure he complains about this in most places we have stayed).Bathroom – Hot water whenever we had showers, good shower as well.Balcony – the studio balcony is tiny – the 1 bedroom balconies looked bigger… We didn’t have any sun (or very little) on the balcony and to be honest that suited me, but its probs not for everyone.Pool – Looks small in the pics, is small in reality however actually thought this was better than other larger pools for 2 reasons.No kids were there (no splashing).  Often there was no one in the pool, or just me.  There was no booking of sunbeds (I was the first person at the pool every day at around 9am which is a welcome change from having to get a sun bed at 6am in many resorts)!The pool was warm (as it has less water to heat up)!Husband tells me I must mention the lack of sun bed mats (I think he must have a bad back as he complained about the hard beds and lack of sun bed mats).  He did ask at the hotel about this and apparently tourists kept stubbing cigarettes out on the mats so they got rid of them!Supermarket – The hotel is on 2 sides of the road.  If you’re in the hotel with the pool (opposite reception), when you come out of the hotel, turn LEFT.  Top of the road there is a mini market (overpriced in my opinion at the top which is 10 seconds walk for essentials) turn LEFT.  Follow the road down and turn RIGHT.  This is Sir Cliff Richards Road (something similar) and after a few mins you will find a large supermarket that sells everything you will need.  We only went to this one (and the fresh bread and cakes were gorgeous).  This is about 7 mins walk.Old Town = If you are in the side of the hotel with the pool, turn RIGHT.  At the end of the road turn right again.  Follow the road down (passing a green statue on your left). Cross over the road and follow the road down. there are some steps in front of you (talking you into the old town) or keep going and turn LEFT when you can SEE a sign for Royal Orchid Thai Restaurant (this takes you into the old town as well).  About 10 mins walk from the hotel.",Jul,2008,Jul 2008,2008-07-01,2008,4
"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Vendredimanche,210,Vendredimanchewrote a review Jun 2021,"Old world charm...this was our first trip abroad post pandemic and we were not disappointed. The views from the hotel are simply out of this world. It’s also worth knowing that the hotel is in town, walking distance (or a very short taxi ride away) from restaurants, shops, the harbour and the old town.The swimming pool (normal and salted water) are great - children tend to hog the normal pool (this was half term after all) but the other one is usually free for adult swimmers or just a dip. There seems to be a bit of a race in the morning to reserve the chairs by the pool or the sea! But there is always one free somewhere if you’re not an early riser.The jewel crown of the hotel is the seafront which is accessed by steep steps (or a lift) with 2 diving boards and a large pool which gets filled with seawater through the waves. It’s a beautiful place.Also worth mentioning are the quiet lush gardens.The food is gorgeous whether that’s breakfast (huge choices with lots of healthy options), lunch by the pool and dinner upstairs in the terrace.  I enjoyed the fact that people dress up properly for dinner.We didn’t get to try  Villa Cipriani which was fully booked every night of our stay - so make sure to book it as soon as you book your stay!The staff is very friendly and attentive. Service was a bit slow sometimes, but the hotel had recently reopened after the pandemic, and was full. So I will make allowance for that. They were aware of the issue and regularly apologised.Our rooms were lovely, with sea views. The toiletries are from Porto Claus - smelling wonderful.The concierge has plenty of good recommendations for tours by boat or jeep.The old black and white photos decorating the wall are testament to the history of the hotel (also visited by Churchill) and we did get a real sense of this old world charm.Not a cheap option, but certainly a luxuriously decadent option!",Jun,2021,Jun 2021,2021-06-01,2021,4
Royal Savoy Hotel,jerzyf,54,jerzyfwrote a review Jun 2016,"Have stayed at the Royal Savoy on two occasions now and both stays were completely satisfactory. The RS has a number of room options varying in size as well as self-catering suites.As befitting a Savoy branded hotel on arrival your bags disappear to be delivered to your room by the time you have checked in. The reception staff are very efficient ensuring check-in takes no longer than necessary and provide you with plenty of information regarding activities in and around the hotel.The rooms themselves are fairly 'traditional' in terms of décor but are spotlessly maintained and all have excellent views of the pool area and the sea beyond. The pool area is very large and has a wide range of options for seating and sunbeds etc. The pool bar is open from 10 or so and provides an excellent range of drinks and snacks - although these are expensive in relation to surrounding bars and restaurants. A terrace restaurant and an indoor formal restaurant completes the available dining options. There is also a lounge/cocktail bar indoors which is small but provides a good array of cocktails, wines etc.Most evenings have a 'theme' in dining terms and are priced from about 30 euros upwards per person.Overall the RS has an 'old style' luxury fell to it and certainly won't disappoint and traveller who stays there.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4
Royal Savoy Hotel,SXMCabanaBoy,80,SXMCabanaBoywrote a review Jun 2013,"We stayed on an Interval International exchange and we could not have been more pleased.  Truly an amazing and wonderful experience!!!  We traded a 2 bedroom unit, so we received a two bedroom unit at the Royal Savoy.  I don't know if it was because our flight didn't get us there until 1 AM for check-in but they gave us one of their two, two bedroom Presidential Suites (room 1418).  Really a wonderful Suite with all the amenities and daily maid service too.  The view is amazing, 270 degrees, overlooking the pool and directly out over the ocean.  It could not be more beautiful!!!  The staff is exceptional and very knowledgeable about Funchal and will go out of their way to make your stay just perfect.  They welcome the opportunity to help you select a restaurant then call to make your reservation.  We told them we were celebrating an Anniversary and they sent us a bottle of wine, two glasses and flowers.  The location is also within walking distance to downtown so that saves a lot of time and taxi fares!  If you go to Funchal then we HIGHLY recommend you stay at the Royal Savoy!

Royal Savoy Hotel,LesleySheffield,47,LesleySheffieldwrote a review Mar 2013,"Stayed here in February - first time we have been here at this time of year.  Temperature was in low low 60s or 18 /19 degrees.   Lots warmer than the UK but did not feel warm enough to swim outside but we did sunbathe or some days and got quite a tan on some days.  It was hot enough to sit out and eat at lunchtime but had to eat inside in the evenings.  Hotel was still as lovely as ever.  Service very good.  The rooms are well specced with everything you could need in the kitchen.  The cleaners come in every day and fold your nightear into fancy shapes and leave little chocolates on the pillows.  Love the decor, especially all the Tribal art collection and the view from the room.  The only downside was the lack of wi-fi, you have to pay to be wired in.There is still lots to do at this time of year.  One day we hired a taxi to Porto Monix.  We have been here for the swimming in the summer but it was fantastic to see it in the winter.  The waves were enormous and the sea looked like a boiling cauldron - see our photos but on shore there was no wind and you could sit on the edge of the sea with a coffee taking in the sun but next to a raging sea.  Amazing.It was lovely to get some sunshine at this time of year - would recommend a winter visit.",Mar,2013,Mar 2013,2013-03-01,2013,4

Pestana Viking,GV,0,GVwrote a review Sep 2023,"First the good...nice pool, friendly staff, great views...now the bad....1) they offer NO PARKING. You have to find parking on the street. Plus there is no parking space to check in. I had to park in a handicap spot and for the 10 minutes I was checking in, I got yelled at for this. 2) We were 3 adults that rented a 2 bedroom/2 bath suite...but they would only give us 1 key. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels worldwide and this was the first time I was denied a 2nd key. It made it difficult to coordinate people coming and going. 3) Our 2nd bedroom did not have an AC vent and it was stifling at night. They did offer to move us and give us a 2nd key on the last day of our stay but too little too late. 4) This is a family resort. 90% of the people there had kids 16 and under. So if you are an adult looking to sit by the pool with a quiet cocktail, this is NOT the place. 5) One of our bath towels had a hole in it...really? 6) Pool area needs landscaping. Where we sat poolside was on dirt and when you are wet on dirt, it makes mud. 7) Only dinner option was a buffet. With COVID and kids sticking their fingers everywhere, buffets are off limits...so we went to neighboring hotels and gave them our dinner business...and finally 8) their letterhead said it is a Beach and Golf resort...did not see a golf course anywhere and the beach is a public beach next door that you have to walk down quite a ways to get to and being a hotel guest gets you nothing. So if you you are an adult with a car who dislikes buffets, likes your towels with no holes, likes AC... then stay away from this place.",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,2
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,R_bournemouth,74,R_bournemouthwrote a review Apr 2015,"Firstly and most importantly the staff are amazing, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable so no issues there. The buffet breakfast is excellent with more than enough to keep you going. Evening menu was excellent and reasonably priced (either a la carte or buffet).The rooms are clean and nicely laid out (bathroom was very good) and with the balcony overlooking the beach the views were fantastic. There is also wifi included in the room costs.The down side, IMHO, considering this is a 5 star hotel, is the amount of additional services that guests need to pay for. Simple things like tea and coffee in the room (although two small bottles of water were given each day complimentary), e10 for an hour on the pool table, e11 for the use of the internal pool and Jacuzzi to name but a few.However this did not distract from out enjoyment of what is otherwise an excellent hotel.",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4

The hotel is a 5/10 minute walk to the marina which has several restaurants and bars and is a 5 minute taxi ride from Aquashow which is a great water park! Staff were exceptionally helpful and attentive and the food was amazing! We spent a good amount each whilst we were there but it was definitely worth it.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Brittany F,15,Brittany Fwrote a review May 2016,"Stayed here May 2016 fab hotel, on arrival greeted by staff for help with luggage and quick check in.  (although it was evening time so not rush hour).  The hotel is really lovely and the pool area is huge with plenty of beds and umbrellas and loads of beach towels for you.  If you are lying on the grassy area of pool you have a sea view which I liked.  (only downside was noise of music and bellowing voices coming from beach loud speaker-drove me mad) but this was not the fault of hotel.  The rooms and bathrooms were really big, I had a side sea view room.  The breakfast was great lots on offer.Just a couple of minor things for such a star rated hotel - no pool service and not many pool staff around to help.  I like hotels that have plenty of staff around pool who take drink/coffee orders without you having to move.A tad slow at breakfast time to allocate tables and I was there in May so god knows how busy it will get in peak season.Staff were slow to come to your table to ask about tea/coffee our breakfast was gone each morning before we got someones attention to bring coffee.We had to wait and look around for ages before someone came and took our order.The rooms were clean but whilst looking for something under the bed, there was alot of dust.The spa is fab but way way too expensive you have to pay 11euros to use pool and sauna and steam room etc.   If you get a spa treatment use of these are free.  I paid 50euros for half hour treatment (which was really 20mins)  but that was my fault as I misread the price list, so watch for prices.  The treatments are very expensive compared to other hotels in the area.I would return again for sure but wouldnt avail of the expensive unjustified spa treatments.Also it is a good 10min walk to marina where all the restaurants and bars are.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4

The room was brand new, which sadly also meant that the kitchenette was not functional, no water kettle, no tea/coffee provided, when we asked we were told several stories, depending on who we asked, it was either the items had not yet arrived or that they decided not to provide these amenities.The location and the view made up for these shortcoming.

Despite asking for rooms with a view, we were all given rooms at the 4th floor. All rooms had a balcony that had a wall about 5 feet tall pretty much blocking all the view. It was lime a joke! We asked for a change but no interest in helping out. The staff was not helpful in general. We could have picked close by Pestana or similar if we had known. Once the primary reason you book is not fulfilled, the rest is hard to judge so no comments on cleanliness, etc. not worth staying unless you get a room on 2nd or 3rd floor.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,2

Hotel Principe Lisboa,FormerlyBCBoy3,101,FormerlyBCBoy3wrote a review Jul 2014,"I stayed at the Hotel Principe Lisboa on two different occasions in July, 2014. I was quite satisfied with the hotel, with three minor caveats,  two of which are outside the control of the hotel.The room was a good size, with a large TV and a small desk. The bathroom was excellent – not cramped at all with a shower – good water pressure and no problem with hot water.  Breakfast was good. In addition to the usual cheese and meat slices and pastries (including excellent pasteis de nata if you get there early enough) they had a very good and varied fruit bowl.  The people who worked in the breakfast room kept the food topped up, and bussed the tables immediately. Never had a problem getting a table or finding food trays empty. There was a small refrigerator in both rooms I had, which did not double as a mini-bar. I prefer it that way.Both rooms I was in had a balcony with a table and two comfortable chairs. There's no view to speak of but it's great to sit outside in the relative cool of the evening and have a glass of wine, and a snack on the balcony. You can buy snacks at El Cortes Ingles around the corner and keep them in the fridge. I'm not sure all rooms have balconies, so ask.There is a tiny bar on the ground floor that I never really saw anybody use.The free wi-fi worked great.The front desk staff were polite and helpful, and fully fluent in English.Caveat 1:  The room safe is the old fashioned kind where you need to get the lock and key from the front desk (no charge, but a 20 Euro deposit). I hate these safes. The last thing I want is to be responsible for not losing the safe key when I am out.Caveat 2: There is no decent place to eat near the hotel. There are a couple of early-closing not-very-impressive cafes but other than that, not much.Caveat 3: On paper the location looks excellent, and for the most part it is. It is at the end of the red metro line which means you can get to and from the airport and the Oriente train station without a metro transfer, and it is also on the blue line which gets you right downtown, and to the Rossio and St. Apolonia train stations, in a couple of stops. The picture on the website suggests that the metro entrance is right across the street, which it is. However that entrance is to the red line, and there are no lifts or elevators up the considerable distance to the street. The elevators and lifts are at the very other end of the station, on the blue line/El Cortes Ingles side. The sidewalks in all of Lisbon are uneven, and occasionally broken, cobblestone. In short, they are rubbish to walk on (very attractive though). Also there is almost no such thing as level ground in Lisbon outside the downtown tourist areas. So the above ground walk from the  blue line/El Cortes Ingles side is not easy for people with walking difficulties (me). For the fully ambulatory it should be no problem.Overall, good hotel, good value, location fine if you're not mobility impaired. I probably wouldn't stay there again because of my mobility issues, but if the city ever put escalators on the red line side, I'd stay there again, no problem.

The food and service was fantastic.Shout out to Gabrielle, who served us most days in the Ocean Bar.Cleanliness of the rooms was also fantastic, linen changed ones and towels changed every day.Will definitely revisit for a summer all-inclusive where there will be a wider choice of restaurants to dine in.It just goes to show that reviews arenâ€™t always right.
