Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,MsHT76,4,MsHT76wrote a review Jul 2013,"My husband and i stayed here for a week this June. The hotel apartments are lovely and very modern. They have everything you could want, and it's great to have the best of both worlds - breakfast included as well as self catering facilities.We ate in the restaurant a couple of times. It's good food, but lacks a little atmosphere. Breakfast was okay, could be improved a bit i think.The area is quite quiet, so worth hiring a car to get into Lagos, which is just that little bit too far to walk. You also need one to get to the supermarket, which is a bit of a mission up a big hill!The hotel is right on a beautiful beach, which has a couple of good little eateries. The pool had plenty of space. It was a shame the outdoor pool was too cold for people to use, but useful to have the indoor one.All round great place to stay. If a little quiet, and quite windy!",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Adam B,0,Adam Bwrote a review Apr 2025,"Where do we start, arrived on the Friday 18th around lunchtime, when we arrived at the hotel we checked in both families rooms(which took an eternity, very laboured and slow) one room was ready immediately, the other room we were told would be ready within an hour. So we went back around an hour and half later and room still not ready, they took my number and said would call before 3pm to let us into the room. 5pm arrives and still no call, so we went back to reception and was told the rooms been ready since 2.30pm. Obviously not best pleased.  We then went to the room and requested an Iron, didn't arrive for 3 days so had no clothes that we could wear, we asked everyday for the iron.The food, what can i say, the options are very limited and basic, meats are dry as a bone, the kids breakfast station consisted of pancakes only, and in the evenings nuggets chips and plain pasta. If you like fruit for breakfast lunch and dinner you will be ok. Food was cold, bland and no flavour.The children's entertainment was again another shocker, the staff didn't even know the words and dances to the songs, we couldn't believe it, very unprofessional. The evening entertainment i think i could have done karaoke better, the mamma mia show they were all miming out of line with the songs and just very very poor.All of the pools were horrifically cold and kids didn't want to swim in them, the indoor heated pool was not included and had to be paid for which booked up so fast as it was so small. Day 2 they ran out of beer which is all we wanted to drink during the day. Snack bar ran out of beer all week and pumps broken and not fixed.The children's pool one of the metal displays was knocked over by a child and the base was left in the pool all sharp and rugged right next to the bottom of the slide. After we complained the lifeguard stuck a table on top of it and it stayed that way all week, absolute disgrace.Day 3 they had workers digging up 3 big holes around the pool area and sectioned off that part of the loungers.All in all this is not a 5 star hotel and i wouldn't even go as far as a 4 star. We have stayed in way better 4 star hotels. Not worth the money do not bother.",Apr,2025,Apr 2025,2025-04-01,2025,1

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,miguel888,1,miguel888wrote a review Aug 2025,"We had a lovely stay here. Very clean hotel, all inclusive, really hard working helpful and harmonious team of staff and hot weather.Our 6 year old had a fantastic holiday and we were happy too - what more could you ask for,The kids club staff work incredibly hard  but so does everyone that i could tell and all with a smile, bar staff, cleaning and maintenance staff, concierge, reception - i could go on.The team all around the hotel are a credit and no doubt contribute to the overall laid back feel of the hotel  which keeps standards high.There was food and drinks available all day and a very wide selection so there should be something for everybody. We enjoyed the themed dinner evenings in the buffet restaurant (american, indian, chinese)Great fun around the pool from scheduled activities to the water slides which were very good. A lot of people stay in this hotel but it never felt TOO crowded - always enough sun loungers for example. The free hourly shuttle to Albufiera (old town) was great and organised well, requiring a ticket from an electronic station.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,4

Quinta Mirabela,HMDunne,35,HMDunnewrote a review Apr 2022,"We travelled as a family group with 3 rooms. We were booked into superior rooms overlooking the pool, but these could not be provided due to C19. However, Victor was so accommodating explaining the situation and the hotel offered to cover our drinks with our DB&B package as compensation.  This more than made up for the switch and our rooms, 301,302 and 302 had stunning views over the terrace to the open sea.  It has to be said Quinta Mirabela must have some of the best views on the Island. The restaurant menu is impressive offering local dishes, lots of fish, and a pasta menu. The restaurant team make your dining experiences so special, with their attention to detail, such friendly manner and can't do enough for you attitude. Marco, Daniel and Nuno are as much an \"entertainment team\" as they are restaurant team. We laughed with them all week and they made all of our family feel fully included and special. I can highly recommend the mussels and for something different the scabbard fish with banana!Breakfast is buffet style with hot freshly cooked options, including pancakes and omelettes.The location of the hotel is perfect to watch the daily passing of the traditional basket rides,  the hotel shuttle bus takes you into town and a trip up in the cable car is so worth it.  Our rooms, were well equipped, except for a tea tray but the available from the bar. All were cleaned daily with toiletries and soft towels and dressing gowns.Town is lovely to wander around with lots of outdoor dinning options, wander the lanes through the old town and admire the door artwork. The market is also worth a visit.We asked Sara and Tanya the reception team to help us with various queries and telephone calls and again this this did with a smile and lovely manner.It just leaves me to say that we would all highly recommend Quinta Mirabela and only wish we had longer!! We will be back - thank you all x",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,4

PortoBay Serra Golf,CherryClift,150,CherryCliftwrote a review Mar 2014,"We had booked a superior room but were upgraded to the suite which was lovely. The bed in the main bedroom was huge and comfortable.Direct access to the gardens and a walk to pool.I enjoyed my swim under the glass covered roof in the rain and the sauna was relaxing.The night we stayed was stormy, windy, rainy, thunder and lightening.  If this is not a very rare occurrence it would be a good idea to fix the windows to stop them rattling.  The noise from this and the rain on the shutters, was loud and our sleep was poor. ( We live in an much older farmhouse and manage to stop the rattles). I mentioned this to the front desk who said they would inform management.Also as suite is under the kitchen or dining room (I'm not sure which) clearing up footsteps go on until about 11.00pm and breakfast preparation starts sometime after 7.00am which spoils the privacy of a luxury suite.Even so we loved our stay, but the superior room might have been better for us.",Mar,2014,Mar 2014,2014-03-01,2014,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,PEH10000,2,PEH10000wrote a review Jun 2014,My second visit to the Dona Felipa with my dad to play golf.. We stayed in one of the rooms that is due to be refurbished. It was still a great room with everyhing we needed - decent sized bathroom with separate WC which was really handy. Stayed for three nights and played four rounds of golf. Breakfast was superb everyday and we then got picked up by Denis to go to San Lorenzo or Pinheiros Altos (depending on where we were playing). Denis is a great guy who is very friendly (in a genuine way). Very knowledgeable about football especially Portugese and Benfica in particular. His english is better than most english people which heps too! Gave us great recommendations on where to watch the World cup. I'm a big fan of the Dona Felipa and hope to return next year.,Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,4

All activities that we tried (guided city walk, surfing lessons, Fado Experience, Sintra tour), organized by the hotel, was excellent.

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,SMLR,0,SMLRwrote a review Oct 2018,"Not a 5* at all- not much choice of food, stayed here while a group of Spanish stayed who looked down their noses at people and was ignorant making the stay uncomfortable and making there no room in the restaurant and bar at times as there was so many of them. Entertainment some nights was Spanish so I’m not sure what us English was supposed to do? Also, the bar doesn’t open until 12 and only had snacks between 4 and 5 so had to go out spending money on food as we got hungry inbetween meal times which is a joke as we’ve paid to be all inclusive. Not only was there hardly any choice of food, but not for drinks either, wasn’t allowed certain things of the menu had to pay extra for them.Spa room was a good thing to have however it’s not really hygienic in there. On the first day we complained and they didn’t want to listen to us and shut us off.  Won’t be returning.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,2

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,ColinM2,20,ColinM2wrote a review Jun 2007,"The 25 Feb 06 review below pretty much says it all but to add/ reiterate a couple of points.This is fantastic value for a genuine design hotel (minimal rooms, infinity pool, lightbox restaurant,  etc.) in an exceptional location overlooking the Atlantic. Bed & breakfast with a full, elevated, cliff top seaview plus airport transfers for €83 per room per night is a genuine bargain. By rights, it should be twice the price and were it on an island that had a reputation for a slightly younger clientele, slightly cheaper flights (though GB´s flights were competitive) and perhaps also a better guaranteed sun record, it would.The one reason for there not being a higher quantity of glowing reviews here is. perhaps, that 90% of the guests are German speaking (although English is the first language of the hotel) with the remainder largely Portugeuse.Do note that Ponta do Sol itself has little to divert. Whilst the hotel does offer a range of free transfers to Funchal (20 mins) and for walking the levadas, a hire car is recommended for those staying anything more than a handful of days.The staff are great but not intrusive. The pool honesty bar is beyond reasonable (coffee €1, beer €2). The restaurant is above average with a superior breakfast buffet.Altogether, highly recommended.",Jun,2007,Jun 2007,2007-06-01,2007,4

Independente Principe Real,DiggerJCB,7,DiggerJCBwrote a review Mar 2024,"On arrival we realised the place was a hostel as well as a hotel, which wasn't clear when we booked through Secret Escapes.  The reception area was chaotic as it seemed everyone checked in at the same time.  There were 2 young women on duty, who were perfectly pleasant but not very efficient.  To get to our room we had to go back outside, as the hostel is in the main part of the building.  The front door is very heavy and slams if you don't grab it before it closes - this was an issue through the night as pretty much everyone let it slam. As our room was directly above it, we were wakened on a number of occasions. It may be an idea to put a notice on it to let guests know.We were disappointed with our room. We expected it to be quirky, which was why we booked it, but the furniture could do with being better. Our wardrobe screeched every time we opened the doors. Saying that, the room was very clean and the bed exceptionally comfortable.  The shower is outstanding and there was always hot water available. The room was cleaned each day we were there and fresh water left for us.  The television didn't work when we turned it on, so my husband went to reception to ask for help with it.  They never came.  We asked a further twice and no one turned up.The hotel is in a beautiful location with fantastic views across the city.  There is a lovely plaza just across the road and there were various types of musicians there every day and also a café, under an awning if you wanted to sit and have a drink and a pastry.As in previous reviews, our room was at the front of the hotel and the traffic is non stop 24/7, as you'd expect in a busy city.  The windows kept out a lot of the noise but the room was very hot at times so we couldn't have the windows open.  There were no instructions on how to work the heater in the room, or to tell us about wi-fi or even recommendations for what to see, where to eat and transport. That would have been helpful.The wi-fi is woefully inadequate in the side where the hotel is; it may be better in the hostel side.  The password is only available in reception.Breakfast was adequate. There is a buffet which was replenished regularly but if you want a hot breakfast, the choice was pretty much eggs or pancakes.  On the first morning we were pretty much ignored; there were 2 young women but they never approached us to tell us how things worked.  The rest of the stay was better as there was a lovely lady there who was efficient and made things run smoothly. It made us smile to hear her sing her way through breakfast and engage with the guests.There is a rooftop restaurant that only caters for private functions and it is above the rooms in the hotel side, with access through the same front door. There was a function on one of our nights and the noise was ridiculous until 2 in the morning. The front doors were wide open and there was a constant stream of people up and down the stairs, past our room. There is a piano in the lobby, which people were playing. I have no objections to that - just not after midnight! We also had the smell of cigarette smoke as the doors were open all night.  If you are going to have a function suite, it should be separate from the guest bedrooms.I hate writing negative reviews, but all the smaller issues just make it impossible to have a really positive experience.All this being said, we loved Lisbon. It's a vibrant city, with lots to see and do. If you have mobility problems, then the many hills would not suit. However, there is an excellent public transport service, lots of taxis and tuk tuks everywhere.We would highly recommend the Benfica Stadium Tour, if you are a lover of football. Our ticket included access to the museum after the tour.  At 17 Euro's each, it was a bargain. We also went to the Castelo de Sao Jorge.  There isn't a huge amount there but the views from it were amazing and it was lovely to walk around the grounds and find out its history.  We arrived about 11am and it was getting very busy, so I imagine it gets more so as the season goes on. There are lots of boat trips available and we did one that lasted an hour and a half. It was wonderful to see the coast of Lisbon by boat and a very chilled way to do it.There are so many different places to eat and drink, you are spoiled for choice and there are many and varied shops to explore. We had a warm welcome wherever we went.There is so much to see and do, you'd need more than one visit to this wonderful city.",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,2

Luna Clube Oceano,Annie B,10,Annie Bwrote a review Jul 2014,We have just returned from our second visit to this hotel and I can say we were disappointed.  There has been no updating since we were there last and the room we were given this year was quite poor.  The fridge hardly worked and made loud noises all night.  Staff did look at it for us and promised it had been fixed..... The door simply did not fit anymore so the fridge was constantly working or defrosting itself.  The cooker door also looked like it had been pulled off and they had attempted to stick it back together.  Shower curtain rail fell off every time you used the shower....  However the room was very clean and the staff came in at least once every two days to tidy up and change the towels.  Staff were helpful but did very little to control the large number of groups of teenagers that were staying.  Parties were a nightly thing with empty bottles thrown in the pool and broken glass on the poolside.  This is not a hotel for couples who want a chilled out holiday as advertised.  Location is perfect and with a bit of modernisation this would be a lovely place to stay.  I don't want this to sound too negative however it is wrongly aimed at couples wanting a beach holiday.,Jul,2014,Jul 2014,2014-07-01,2014,2

We stayed here for two days before moving on to Madeira, then we came back for one night before flying home. The staff here went above what any typical front desk staff does. Our flight was delayed five times and we asked to pay to stay in one room till later since our son has Epilepsy and sitting at an airport for hours was not optimal. They even arranged for transfers to the airport once flight was ready to leave. My son also has severe nut allergies and the staff at breakfast pulled food from the kitchen so he did not have to eat off the buffet and chance cross contamination. I want to Thank all of the staff for helping make our stay amazing!!The rooms were clean and comfortable with cute balconies we had coffee on each morning.

I stay in a lot of 5 Star hotels, including some of the other Belmond hotels, and this is one of my favourite's.  I only stayed 4 nights, but next time I will stay longer as there are plenty of excursions and activities you can do if you don't want to just relax.My room was lovely.  I opted for the Original part of the building but if you prefer more modern then the Garden block is more suitable for you.My room was clean, comfortable and balcony gave a beautiful view out onto the ocean.  The 2 swimming pools on the bar area were excellent and there was plenty of sun beds.  One level down onto the Sea deck area, there are plenty more sun beds and one more swimming pool which is fed by the sea.  You can also dive into the sea from there also.  My dinners at the hotel were all excellent.  Williams Restaurant worthy of its Michelin star.  Villa Cipriani was also nice, as was the terrace dinner restaurant.  Breakfast was quite good too.The complimentary extras such as wine tasting one night a week, pilates, aqua fitness and the complimentary shuttle into Funchal during the day time were excellent too.out of the excursions that they can arrange, I did the side car tour, which was wonderful.I used the Spa whilst there, and this was lovely too.I have nothing but praise for this hotel and can't wait to return.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,PP,56,PPwrote a review Oct 2014,"They say you get what you pay for and this sums up our Crowne Plaza experience.   It was a cheap option so for the money £54 a night B& B via travel republic you can't really grumble too much.  However the setting and the building itself is lovely, the rooms in particular with lovely bathrooms and very comfortable beds.   If only someone took charge of the front of house service it would be fantastic.  There was no visible management of any kind in the hotel and it translated in terrible service.  The dining room staff had no system to managing tables and people would end up helping themself from the waiter station for tea coffee etc at breakfast.  The bar staff were rushed off their feet and service very slow. The reception staff in the main were very helpful bar one. No one was managing  the pool area so getting a bed was impossible as towels were deposited very early or maybe even the night before.  The sunbed cushions were filthy and the beanbags look like a health hazard. The grass area was being dug up so hence our daily visit to the beach - 16 euros for 2 beds for the day but happy to pay it.  One night we took dinner in the restaurant - poor and some items cold as no one was overseeing the buffet dishes.  The hotel was also subject to a mix of clientele.  Unfortunately there were a couple of loud, foul mouthed male groups when we were there.  We wouldn't return.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,2
Pestana Viking,FigoSomerset,18,FigoSomersetwrote a review Jul 2011,"Lovely hotel set between two small but super beaches.  Quiet location so not for you if you want nightlife and shops.  Scenic walk along the cliffs to Armacao, which is a pleasant little resort.  Rooms are spacious and well-equipped - really good kitchenette area with kettle, fridge, microwave, crockery etc.  Safe costs 2 euros a day.  No hairdryer or iron in the room, but hairdryer available from reception.  Really lovely pool - lots of sunbeds, free pool towels.  Ate in the restaurant twice - a la carte was good, themed buffet every night too.  Was a kids club and activities in the pool for an hour every afternoon.  The staff were very, very helpful indeed.  Spa area and treatments are great. Main gripe was that we booked a room with a sea-view and got a room at the side of the hotel, which was a view of trees with glimpses of water between.  However, this issue was resolved satisfactorily by the reception staff. Used Yellowfish for our transfers from Faro to the hotel - can highly recommend them too.  Local buses to Portimao and Albufeira are fast and cheap, but not particularly regular, so you need to plan carefully, but otherwise are an easy way to get around without a car. We visited both these places and Fieas, The World of Sand at Pera (there is a special bus you can book from the office in town) and this is definitely worth a visit. We would certainly book a Pestana hotel again.",Jul,2011,Jul 2011,2011-07-01,2011,4

I think as time moves on they will drop the deposit because the hotel does not seek to attracted  the  party groups.The Strip is 15 mins walk if that â€“ top of road turn left, to bottom of road turn right â€“ easy, plenty of restaurants about, Indian curries seem popular, most of the restaurants have Tourist menus, but seemed better to pick a main off the normal menu.We did walk to the Old town during the day about 1 hour (calling for a pint) but we are blessed with good health â€“ if not 6 euros in a taxi (rank to rank).Lack of branded shops around the area if you like the Brands its 11 euros to Albufaria shoppingRecommend a Bar called 33`s â€“ great atmosphere massive selection of drinks â€“ lucky to watch Portugal v Spain in world cup.Recommend Wander Inn Pub â€“ Great Breakfast and Menu â€“ Bargain 2 meals 15 EurosHave a good Holiday",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,2

All I can say is some people must be very hard to please.  Reception couldnâ€™t have been more helpful, porterage was provided taking our luggage and belongings direct to our apartment. Very good service.  The only fault and really we shouldnâ€™t complain, was the room was on the small side.  The room had everything you needed, was cleaned every day, beds changed every day and towels changed regularly.

You really do feel like you're hanging out with mates in your own home. There's always someone knocking about if you need something.It can be boisterous, but usually if you want somewhere to stay that's not got a personality you stay in a boring hotel and don't make eye contact.The area is really nice. There's a supermarket 5 mins walk away. Beach 20 mins walk away. There are nice little bars and fantastic places to eat. Lagos is a real cosy, wee gem.If you're looking for a place to stay where you can kick back and be yourself, then this is the place to go.We'd go back in a heart beat but I'm not sure what the policy is on taking a baby?

Rooms are quite luxurious and very spacious - they also have well fitted out bathrooms.  I would request a pool view as some rooms face a busy street or a garage so pool views are quieter! (Garage is a good place to get alcoholic drinks and snacks!)Breakfasts were the best we had on our holiday - everything on offer you could wish for!  Did not eat dinner here so we could not comment.Situation is great - about a 7 minute walk into town centre where there are some nice bars and restaurants - we enjoyed Os Arcos and Bicos ( great local fish).  Irish Bar near bridge was also very good.  Tavira is one of the nicest towns in the Algarve with lovely architecture - a must to see if you are travelling around.Pool was very nice and peaceful - no problems getting sunbeds or parasols.We would stay here again for sure!,Jul,2008,Jul 2008,2008-07-01,2008,5

The room was noisy as you can hear traffic and also the service truck from early morning.  Aside from this the room was good everything you need, although we found pillows too soft, hotel is pleasant with good breakfast and service always lots available and cheery staff, the bar closes at 12 and does not offer a night service which I found odd, location is good and reception staff helpful, overall good stay.",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,3

In both rooms the cleanliness was very superficial. Indeed the rooms have been renewed but still a lot of work needs to be done.The breakfast didn't have very fresh products.

The rooms are comfortable and the bedding exquisite. The welcome is kind and the decor extremely neat. The problem is that you do not feel very comfortable.... I explain: in the evening you are asked the exact time you want your breakfast and its contents. The next morning it seems difficult to depart from your choices made the day before. So you feel more like a guest, rather than feeling free like home. Likewise when the afternoon takes you to drink coffee, know that it is possible but it will pay.... In short, I think the rules should be reviewed a little. An à la carte breakfast when we wake up would be appreciated as well as the possibility of having eggs in the plate rather than scrambled.

Fortunately, it was off season otherwise the noise would have been brutal. The balcony is pretty much on the street and very small too. Not very useful. It felt very safe.The room was small but comfortable, Excellent bedding, comfortable mattress and pillows. Spotless clean. The bathroom too. Make sure to use the floor mat in the bathroom, the floor is very slippery when wet.Hangers in the closet are placed back to front not side to side, which makes it cumbersome to use.The coffee maker in the room is good enough and the fridge tiny but did the trick. I  used to make tea (with a teabag not the tea provided by the hotel-capsules like the coffee ones)Staff were very helpful and pleasant. They speak good English and were always ready to help.Good breakfast. The breakfast room is small and I imagine it would be crowded during high season. We always found a table and food at 9 AM.Only one coffee machine,  a bit of a line up. Gluten free buns and muffin were available if requested. Individually wrapped and warmed up before serving. The woman attending the breakfast room was very pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately, I had a bad cold and one morning I preferred to have breakfast in the room. She made sure I had my GF bun and muffin for my husband to bring into the room.There is a swimming pool but was a bit cold during our stay so we did not use it. We used the luggage room for a few hours before the transfer to the train station.We were  very comfortable in Rochavau. Thank you Rochavau staff.Will return.
