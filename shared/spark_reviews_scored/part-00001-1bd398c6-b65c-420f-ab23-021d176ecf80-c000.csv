Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Katie H,1,Katie Hwrote a review Jun 2015,"My family and I stayed here for the first time for a week and it was so much more than we even hoped for. The hotel was opened in 2011 and is in amazing condition, apartments were of a very high standard, facilities excellent, staff wonderful and great peaceful location.5 min taxi into the old town/marina (6 Euros) Beach is stunning, 5 min walk.Perfect if you want great quality, short hall flight, lots of English speaking locals and bargain prices.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,5

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Dianne L,9,Dianne Lwrote a review Jul 2019,"They had us at the view! We just finished a week here and overall had a great stay. We debated between 4 and a 5 star rating as some of the other reviewers mention there are some things that could be done better. The drinks and food prices were very expensive. Outside of breakfast that was included , we trended to eat or get drinks in town where quality and prices significantly better. Service in the restaurants was just okay and air conditioning in the room did not work well.Despite that there were many great thing about the hotel. The view is better then the pictures. Our family room was a good size and worked well for two adults and two teenagers. The hotel is beautifully decorated. Breakfast was very good with lots of choices. The front desk was very accommodating and helpful. The location is very good and you can walk to the beach or the town in 10 minutes.We would definitely return to this hotel",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Daniel P,4,Daniel Pwrote a review Jul 2017,"Just returned from a 6 day break at the Belmar Spa and Beach resort.Very nice, spacious 2 bed apartment. Everything worked and we were very comfortable.Location is key with the Belmar, it's right on a nice beach but walkable (20 mins) into Lagos town, which at night is vibrant and atmospheric.Why not 5 stars?1. Room was cleaned only once in 6 days.2. Although we were aware that check-in was from 4pm we knew we would arrive early and we phoned to see if we could check-in a little earlier. Although they sounded very positive on the phone about accommodating our request when it came to it they couldn't, which left us in limbo for a couple of hours.3.  We come to the Algarve every year and stay somewhere different. At £1100 (room only) for 6 nights, this is more than double the amount we have ever paid for accommodation, therefore expectations were high. I left feeling the Belmar was over-priced compared to other experiences we have had on the Algarve. However, we've never been so close to the beach before, so I guess the location comes at a premium.Ultimately, I can recommend the Belmar.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Rui Menezes,37,Rui Menezeswrote a review Sep 2018,"Belmar Spa & Beach Resort is beautiful. It’s wonderful location on the cliff top of Porto de Mós Beach is perfect and if you have a room with a view you can enjoy great sunsets. The rooms are big and in pristine conditions. Food is great, mainly breakfast, which has lot of variety and great quality in everything. We had dinner once and it was also quite good. Parking is available which is great, especially if you go during summer time. We are definitely returning to Belmar!",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,5
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,mary s,116,mary swrote a review Sep 2023,"This beautiful hotel does so many things well. But it’s the little things that can hurt the experience. The Wi-Fi in the rooms is so bad it’s almost useless: 12mbs. We had no washcloths in the bath - probably just an oversight and not a big deal, but still annoying. The lack of outlets is inexcusable. There are no accessible outlets near the bed. We had to charge electronics in the bathroom and on the floor across from the bed. Really? The bathroom is laid out so that the soap dispenser is on the opposite side of the counter from the sink. It’s 2 steps to get soap and 2 steps back to the faucet. First time I’ve seen that.The breakfast buffet is outstanding and service is very good as long as you don’t need a refill on coffee.  The sky bar is beautiful but I had the worst martini ever there.I don’t know if it was cheap gin, watered down gin, or no gin, but it wasn’t drinkable.In all, this is a beautiful hotel. If only they could fix the little annoyances…",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,3
Saccharum,emannah,9,emannahwrote a review May 2016,"I am not entirely sure what I expected, this is a quirky place perhaps more style than substance.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad here, it is just that there is nothing great either.  We went for the top end room, a sea view suite and it is lovely.  The suite comes with free spa access - otherwise 20 euro per person per day.  The enormous bath that overlooks the sea is also great fun.That said the room level design is ill conceived and owes more to pretentiousness than utility.  Storage is poor, the provision of sockets is poor (the kettle is plugged in on the floor by the door), the glass doors are just silly, the glass doors on the bathroom offer no privacy, are noisy and irksome. The bed head/utility centre is not fixed, the shower screen is only 50% rather than the industry standard 70% and so water gets all over the floor.  There are too many lights and light switches and the automatic light under the bed is really annoying at 3am when the other half tries to slip away for a quiet bathroom visit (the doors are especially annoying then too).Breakfast is ok but in 6 days we have only be greeted once.  Sorry but, meet, greet and seat with coffee served at the table is a minimum for 4 stars in my world.The spa again is over thought out and therefore misses its own point.  The pool is too cold, the jacuzzi too chlorinated and we have no idea what the relaxation room and salt room are about..... We are regular spa users and even so we're bemused by it.  I am a gym nut and this is one of the better every day hotel gyms I have seen anywhere in the world, so quite happy there.That said we kind of like the place, most of the staff and the hotel in general are trying to make a poor concept work.  The lynch pin is a chap called Jose (Joe) an engaging local who has nevertheless seen the world and knows how to talk to people.The transfers to Funchal for the day are great but a little prices and if, like me you are easily bored, you will need to find things to do as Calheta has little to offer.  On the other hand my wife loves not having much to do so if you are a contented pool lounger, then this is ideal for you.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,2
1908 Lisboa Hotel,Anna W,0,Anna Wwrote a review May 2023,"I don't routine review hotels on tripadvisor, unless, for good or bad, they are exceptional. The 1908 Lisboa definitely falls into the good category. I wasn't sure what to expect at this hotel as it wasn't our first choice, but I'm very glad it was our second. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome. Reception is a small desk between the bar and the restaurant but service is in no way compromised. Receptionis Malfada(?) got us a drink and linked us up on whatsapp so she could help us with sightseeing and other queries. A mid evening arrival and our luggage is whisked up to our room while we are shown into the restaurant for dinner. Rooms and bathrooms  are of a good standard, but some drawers for storage wd be good. Reception and serving staff are all friendly and helpful - with only the odd exception (the trouble with high standards is that the odd minor exception stands out!) The hotel is well located in a pretty square with an outside seated area for drinks and two other restaurants opposite for variety. Hotel decor is stylish and quirky. It boasts a young, fashionable clientele but we didn't feel excluded! Dinner was good, breakfast fab with lots of options, fresh fruit etc.All in all, I would'nt hesitate to recommend the 1908 Lisboa.  (The so called five star hotel where we are currently staying could definitely learn a thing or two from the management at the 1908).",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,bjnewton18,14,bjnewton18wrote a review Mar 2016,"Stayed here for 5 days in a one bedroom apartment in March self catering. It was very quiet but everything still ran as normal eg, shuttle bus to old town was on everyday. The apartment was massive, we hardly used the living room but the kitchen was useful with full appliances in and utilities. The maids brought fresh towels every day for us however we made the beds each day, despite this the room was always kept immaculately clean. On arrival the reception staff were very friendly, gave us plenty of information about our stay and they also ordered taxis for us during our stay (which was a cheap company too!) We also used the spa on one afternoon due to bad weather, which was very relaxing with access to the indoor pool, jacuzzi, sauna and Turkish bath however the only downfall is you have to have a swim cap for the pool which they charge €2.50 for each and after this the pool was actually very very cold. As we were self catering we didn't use either the restaurant or the bar as we went to the old town every night, but we did use the games room a few times for pool which cost us quite a few euros as there is only 1 out of the 3 pool tables which has a white ball! Other than those few little niggles, we really enjoyed our stay and it definitely deserves the rating it has.",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,4

Hotel Cristal Porto,Louise H,0,Louise Hwrote a review Aug 2023,horrible experience even before we got here we had trouble checking into the room. Me and my friend were staying for a tennis tournament and they wouldn’t let us Into our room and would not refund us. They then decided they would let us in. that day we ordered room service and you couldn’t add your room service to the room which was a joke. I then asked to pay in card but they were only accepting cash. The hotel manager called me 3 times and was very rude to me about the situation. The wifi was terrible I could not access anything for the money I paid it was a joke. Terrible place don’t come here it’s awful. So many better hotel around here for less money.,Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,1
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,DDB_Madeira,18,DDB_Madeirawrote a review Aug 2020,"After months of lockdown we treated ourselves for a birthday the last weekend at Estalagem Ponta do Sol.Living on the island for the last 10 years we always go away to Funchal (from Calheta) but this time decided to go to Estalagem as we've heard so many good stories from friends who had stayed there while visiting us, as well as always highly spoken off by our local friends.First of all, the location is excellent, views to the west and south coast from the hotel is breathtaking. A beautiful pool with infinity corner effect from where you can admire the views. The indoor pool is a great addition for colder days but as we were there in the middle of summer, obviously no need for that. Plenty of cozy corners all over the property where you can find the perfect spot to sunbath while admiring the views. Access is made much easier with the lifts that connect all the different levels. Although we did prefer to walk mostly between the levels as the gardens are so beautiful. From the hotel it is a short walk to the beach below and the picturesque town of Ponta do Sol with its alleyways and cozy bars / restaurants.Our room was on the 3 level facing west. Not advertised as a sea view room, but we had 50% sea view and 50% mountain view, to be honest a much prettier picture also at night with the street lights from the town below. At day the mountains / valleys keep changing with the shades as the sun is moving. We could clearly see the amount of thought put in to make it a safe stay referring COVID-19. The chairs all had removable covers that can be washed after each stay. Rooms are decorated minimalistic which make it easier to disinfect. Bathrobes etc all in packaging, as is the cups etc. Our room was spotless and definitely not dated. I did find it useful to have USB sockets built in. Much easier for charging the phone next to the bed. The balcony was spacious too but we did not make much use of it during our stay.Staff were throughout our stay friendly, helpful  and accessible. Keep in mind, with the current pandemic their workload has probably doubled if not more. We could see them constantly disinfect every table, surface etc.  We did not have dinner at the hotel but did go back each evening for a drink to admire the view and lights. Breakfast was served at our table from a small menu, which I actually prefer to a buffet. It was more than sufficient and no problem to ask for seconds. Interesting the amount of staff during the breakfast hours to make sure all guests were served quickly and efficient and at the same time disinfecting the tables for the newly arriving guests.All in all it was one of our most memorable stays on the island. I just can't believe that we only  get around to visit it after 10 years here but we will definitely soon go back for a weekend break!",Aug,2020,Aug 2020,2020-08-01,2020,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,mslovemoney,46,mslovemoneywrote a review Dec 2019,"The Marriott Lisbon is located about 20 minutes from the airport and is about 5 minutes away from downtown and the edge of the city center. The hotel lobby is standard for a Marriott inclusive of a gift shop, concierge lounge, and bar. The ground floor has a restaurant, fitness center, outdoor pool and conference rooms. The standard guest rooms and suites are satisfactory, but are dated and in need of modernizing. The plumbing is old and each morning I had to run water for about 5 minutes to open up the lines to rid the foul air emoting from the plumbing. I notified maintenance and they responded to my requests. As a Lifetime Titanium with Marriott I was attempting to use my suite night awards for my stay. There seemed to be quite a bit of misunderstandings between Marriott reservations who booked my room, and the Lisbon staff who somehow between the two did not attach/receive my suite night awards and somehow mixed up my arrival date. The staff onsite accommodated all of my requests to include an upgrade to a suite. Jessica (front desk staff and trainee) did an amazing job with helping me sort through my arrival process and went above and beyond to ensure I had a wonderful stay. I had one mishap, me and 2 of my friends were stuck in the elevator for an hour (not fun while on holiday) but was glad to have a glass of champagne on hand to pass the time away while stuck inside! Paula Coehlo, manager onsite greeted me afterwards and apologized for the mishap and provided a wonderful chocolate and wine tray for me and my friends for the unplanned incident. Thank you! The lounge staff were also super accommodating. Susanna, the evening staff shared “must-do” activities including local foods to try and the nightlife scene. She was awesome!!!  All trips tend to have an element of surprise, or unexpected event and this was certainly true for this stay, but the Lisbon team met  and even exceeded my expectations and made this trip a joyful one...Obrigado Marriott Lisbon Team!!!",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,4

Independente Principe Real,grahamp891,0,grahamp891wrote a review Mar 2017,"Lisbon and the Independente combined to give us a wonderful experience, each and every day of our stay. We had fallen in love with Lisbon the previous year but this time around, the Suites took us to another level. If you want to stay somewhere that has character, style and individuality this is a must. Forget the modern chain, corporate hotels and book in here to enjoy being looked after as a valued visitor to this amazing city. A warm colourful reception area is only matched by the warm friendly welcome from the girls at reception on arrival.The building is Art Deco in style and has been creatively enhanced with restaurants and a bar, which add to the relaxed ambience and atmosphere. Breakfast is served on the terrace and has magnificent views looking over the city and the Tagus. What better start to your day, siting outside in the sun, planning the places to visit, eating a wonderful breakfast and being entertained by the joyful Mamma?The rooms and bathroom are always clean and fresh when you return later in the day. The rooms at the front of the building have stunning views overlooking the park and the city beyond. There is no noise issue even though the road is usually busy with traffic.The central location is perfect for walks to all that this amazing city has to offer. The local area has a good number of interesting, quirky bars and restaurants, allowing you a short walk back to the Independente after an enjoyable evening.We had a wonderful time and we would like to say thanks to all the staff for adding to our wonderful experience in Lisbon. Even the theft of a passport did not dampen our spirits and again a thank you to the Independente for your genuine concerns and in arranging to keep our room for an extra two nights.Hope to see you in the future.Graham and Joyce.",Mar,2017,Mar 2017,2017-03-01,2017,5

Doing BBQs, having drinks by the pool and going out with the staff and guests for dinner in the city center. I came for the surf but the stay at the hostel was already worth it on its own.

Saccharum,robmo33,51,robmo33wrote a review May 2017,"We've stayed in a few 5 star hotels and this was overall the best. Food - we only eat breakfast but always plentiful, good selection and good quality. Room - we booked one with a sea view and we were so glad we did. Just listening to and watching the ocean whilst reading a book or napping was great. Nearby - a few decent restaurants in Calheta to choose from and we went to Estalagem hotel in Ponta da Sol; can highly recommend. Also look out Zion Project for an amazing beach bar with music experience. Only down point was the open plan bathroom in the room which meant you 'really' got to know your partner. Not a bad thing really but sometimes a bit of privacy is nice. Not enough to take a star off.Finally, like to call out the last guy who wrote a terrible review - don't be such a wuss and man up in the pool. It's fine once in. And as for getting charged €10 per room service visit - walk to the supermarket like the rest of us and buy a bottle of coke instead of getting someone to deliver individual cans to your room! And it clearly says on the room service menu that there is a €10 charge per visit! *shakes head*",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4

The room was suppose to be noiseless but it wasn't, probably wouldn't notice it if not for the feeding schedule of our little baby. Didn't really found out the cause/source of the noise, but did talk about it with the front desk, and they where as helpful as could be considering I couldn't pinpoint  what was causing the noise or where exactly it was coming from.If you like to workout during your vacation, I can honestly say this was the hotel with the best gym I have ever found. It's quit nice and let's you do a very reasonable workout .One thing I didn't like, and found to be very poor was the wifi service provided by the hotel. I was in the 4th floor and had next to none Internet access. The signal was very poor, and most of the time nonexistent.

Natura Algarve Club,travelthew0rld2016,7,travelthew0rld2016wrote a review Sep 2016,"Was a bit sceptical before travelling as some reviews are not great but I was pleasantly surprised! Travelled with friends but I would also defiantly come here as a couple or family. It really does suit everyone! It is great if you are looking for self catering in a good location but not right in the heart of the hustle and bustle. It is a 10 minute walk to both the beach and the main strip area of Albufeira. There is a supermarket 2 min walk from the hotel with a few restaurants and bars here as well. We ate at a couple of restaurants located close to the hotel and they were really good! Prob better than most of them on the strip.Apartments are clean and comfortable, quite basic but you are self catering at the end of the day what more do you want or need? You can get wifi for about â‚¬5 per day for use in your room and around the pool/lobby area.Was reasonably priced bar and lunch/snack menu at the property.Staff were always very helpful and nothing was ever too much trouble, always happy to help with a smile.Pool area was great, lovely large pool so it was not cramped. It was also good as separate kids pool meant you didn't have to be right on top of kids playing if you didn't want to.Just one thing to bear in mind....when we arrived we had to pay â‚¬100 euro deposit for any damages, which was not a problem but if you are not expecting it, then it may leave you short.Overall perfect location, clean and friendly.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4
Pedras do Mar Resort & Spa,Amy K,2,Amy Kwrote a review Jul 2019,"Pros and cons of this resort:Pros: it is more relaxing than the hustle and bustle of downtown Ponta Delgada. The breakfast buffet is included and great selection, the bartender pours generously and makes great drinks, the food at the restaurant tastes good for the most part. I had local azorean white fish which was delicious. the pool is very convenient and clean, there are walking paths nearby. There are beautiful views and good ambiance.Cons: if you do stay here, we would recommend a car. Also, don’t plan on being able to get into your room a minute before your check in time. We arrived so exhausted and there was no wiggle room on our check in time. They do allow you to use the facilities though. Front desk staff are somewhat rude and they don’t have any basic items like ibuprofen. The bathroom is see through. If you’re comfortable with seeing each other go to the bathroom it’s not a big deal but there is zero privacy. The restaurant and accommodations made by the staff overall seem to be the worst parts. We were hungry by 5:30 and they told us dinner starts at 6:30. So we walked around and came back at 7. There were maybe 10 tables open yet they told us we need a reservation. So we made one for 8. We think there might not have been enough servers. They really try to squeeze money out of you. The bread which we didn’t want was extra. The water had to be bought- no option for tap water ( but the bar will give you tap water. ) if you order meat get it more well done. Medium rare is cold. They really try to go over the top with presentation but neglect the basics such as food preparation. Some servers are rude and the manager runs around like a chicken with his head cut off. One night there was a wedding and we were informed the restaurant would be closed for dinner but they were serving a buffet for hotel guests. We found out later that we needed to make reservations. We were able to sneak in and realized there were tons of tables open and so much food, which made he whole thing seem absolutely ridiculous. The hotel does a poor job accommodating for guests. So many times I wanted to say, “I’m staying here, do you know that?!” It would really be in their benefit to also have a shuttle with more transports.Overall it would be in anyone’s best interest to stay somewhere else. There are other resorts nearby with comparable prices that are probably much better.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,3
Pestana Viking,Bianca V,0,Bianca Vwrote a review Aug 2023,"Location/view very nice! We had a room with a side sea view on the fifth floor (see photo). In retrospect, we were very happy with this choice due to its quiet location and direct view of the side garden, beach, cliffs and sea. Rooms with direct sea view overlooked the pool and sea.Very quiet around the hotel. I think it could have been a bit more lively. Boulevard Armacao can be reached within 35-40 minutes via a beautiful cliff walk. There is a cozy and friendly atmosphere on boulevard Armacao.You will be taken via Uber for about €5 (bus transport also possible, but not tried)Sufficient sunbeds available at the pool, but many beds need to be replaced.Extra bed in room is not comfortable. Requested an extra mattress after first night. This was also neatly arranged. Regular beds too hard in our opinion.Reception staff friendly and helpful. Cleaning and service staff were very timid and seemed submissive to us. Even with a friendly greeting, they make virtually no eye contact.Breakfast something for everyone, but standard and no variety. Bread (dry) and coffee (weak) not to our taste.Lunch in an outdoor bar: cost/quality disproportionate. Outside of this, an additional 10% service charge will be charged without request. We recommend lunch outside the hotel. Didn't try dinner in hotel.There is a quiet, friendly atmosphere in the hotel, even in high season. If you like entertainment, the hotel is less suitable.We rented a car. Read a lot about insufficient parking. This is also correct directly in front of the hotel. However, you can always find a spot within a few minutes' walk (in the middle of high season).In general, the hotel could use a makeover. In terms of cleaning, everything is (reasonably) kept up to date",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,4

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Jenny W,0,Jenny Wwrote a review Jun 2024,Rooms are only okay very basic!!!Bathrooms are ridiculously small. If there is anyone in your group a bit larger than average avoid. Always arguments from other residents every night. No security that we could see.The surroundings were beautiful but every day not enough sun beds to accommodate the large complex. Not one day out of the four we stayed could we avail of sunbedsWe went to the bar and although we were NOT all inclusive and WERE PAYING customers you could only order one kebab at the snack bar at a time. After queuing in the large queue to order this we were then told we had to pay at the drinks counter!!! This should be clearly marked as it wastes a lot of time. Also for PAYING customers the option to buy a number kebabs if you want should be allowed.(without the ignorance of the men working behind the counter) All our group had to que separately rather than been allowed purchase some for our friends.The room from the reception is literally a trek and a half.

We also hosted our pre-wedding drinks in Cafetaria Mensagem. Bruno and the waiting staff were very helpful both beforehand and on the night, and our guests commented on the lovely views and the friendly service.

Eurostars Porto Douro,Charlie L,25,Charlie Lwrote a review Mar 2019,"The hotel was ideal for us. Location is by the river so the view is always interesting and changing, with activity on the bridges and on the water. It is five minutes' walk from the Ribeiro, where there are a lot of bars and restaurants, buskers, street market, boat trips etc, and also the funicular which takes you up to the top of the cliff where the railway station and the main shopping centre are (2.50 euros per trip; it avoids a hefty flight of steps). The hotel was smart and clean, staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a wonderfully leisurely affair, if you want it to be, served buffet-style from 7am to 11am which suited us fine because one thing we don't appreciate about hotel stays these days is being chased out of breakfast early. There was always plenty of variety on the buffet. One thing to be aware of is that the hotel does not do lunch or dinner, except as an order from the room service menu (pizza, burger, crusty sandwiches) which you can eat in the bar area. The bar closes at 11pm, which will be a bit early for some but didn't bother us, specially with plenty of alternatives nearby.  The hotel's best-kept secret is the roof terrace, accessible by the lift (press 'C') which is a wonderful spot to relax and enjoy the sun, along with views of the Douro.",Mar,2019,Mar 2019,2019-03-01,2019,4

Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Djasta_Prasta,40,Djasta_Prastawrote a review May 2014,"Excellent quality hotel, with very professional staff, spacious rooms and spa with no restrictions for age visits (good for children). I don't know if it was about Portugal, but everywhere we went the service was absolutely excellent, friendly and people genuinely paid attention and always try to help.The terrace on the 19th floor had a great view and service, but there were no cushions on the couches or umbrella's for some shade. I know it was early season, as we visited in May, but still you expect that the facilities will be fully prepared for the guests to enjoy.The breakfast buffet was somewhat poor without any raw vegetables and boring choice of sliced fruit. You cannot really enjoy more than once or twice.This seems to be the hotel of choice for all airlines stopping at Porto, so breakfasts were quite busy. Generally I did not like the taste of water and coffee. I do think Nespresso machines should be a standard kit for any self respectable hotel these days.The bed, bathroom and rooms in general were very good quality and well designed and equipped. The WIFI is 10 euro per 24 hours, but speed is really good and I could stream movies without a problem.The taxis are readily available and the only surprise is that most drivers are well passed retirement age, but some drive as on a race all the time.I fell in love with the cutlery of the hotel and bought a 130 pcs set myself from now my most favourite Portuguese brand Cutipol.I know Portuguese food is excellent, but we found one of the best Japanese restaurants in Europe, I am sure (!) called Ichiban (you need to book it in the evening or there will be no space).Nice holiday! Portugal is a great holiday destination! Would absolutely recommend!",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,4

Very peaceful and helpful.-Amazing location and just near the beach, also a good 15 min walk to InterMarche( local supermarket)- Not overly touristy, so you get your own space.Cons:-In-room amenities could be improved :AC coolness (was not enough to beat the heat), toiletries were bare minimum(toothpaste, moisturiser, hand wash, were all not included), NO complimentary tea/coffee/water in rooms.-The Sea Facing rooms (310, 312, 414) were a BIG disappointment....

Overall, the layout of the room could have been much better given the copious space.The lighting is very dull, and decor is dark.Breakkfast selection was typical of Hilton, but the staff seemed a little aloofOne tip is to take the finicular to the bridge and easily walk on the bridge to cross the river.
