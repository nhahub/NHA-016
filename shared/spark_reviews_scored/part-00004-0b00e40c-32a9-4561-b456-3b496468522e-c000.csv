Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Greg T,8,Greg Twrote a review Aug 2016,"We booked a spacious apartment with 3 bedrooms and a roof terrace. While it's true that the apartment offers plenty of space, we thought all other facilities would be luxurious as well. Maybe they used to be but we are under the impression that management has let things slip..Cleaning was downright rude when we asked them to come back later (no 09:30 am was not a good time with everybody still undressed sorry).We had a nasty argument with the front desk when our youngest was playing in the lobby. Apparently the things that look like tables that they have positioned between sofas there are in fact not tables but pieces of art.On our evening of arrival (9:30 pm) we wanted a quick bite in the restaurant and quickly put the kids to bed after long journey. The waiter looked as us in disgust and told us it was very difficult to order a la cartel that night (it was buffet night).The restaurant is not what one would expect from a 4 star place in any way. Would not go there if it was for free to be honest.We had a pool boy tell us to pick up our stuff (and leave I guess) at 19:55. The pools close at 20:00? He did not ask or inform us. He told us to gather our stuff.Résumé: as long as you do not expect anything from the staff. The rooms are spacious and sort of cleaned twice a week. The pools are nice and what's more the beach is wonderful and really near (kids can walk to the beach).",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,gemmylou873,0,gemmylou873wrote a review Aug 2023,"Positives about the hotel …great location. Rooms spotless and quite spacious. We had a sofa bed and travel cot , still plenty of room.Kids had a great time. This is a kid hotel , not for couples without kids ! Unless you really like to hear screaming kids all day ( including mine ). Buffet food was fine , plenty of choice , not terribly hot but always the case. Al a carte restaurants were lovely and made a change from having to queue for the buffet.Slides are ace !! So much fun.Few bits of constructive feedback:Snacks selection , dry baguettes , bright green jelly !Limited ice cream selection not would I would expect of a 5 starNo other snacks , other hotels I have stayed had crepes in the day or giros for example. We found the burger bar on the last day. Not great quality.No bar snacks in the evening ( nuts , olives or crisps to have with a cold beer ) just a few in paper cups would be sufficient. Alternative is to purchase extortionately pricedCrisps from the shop.Lifts !!! What a terrible system , lift E not working. Every guest I spoke to complained about them. Very frustrating as you cannot select a floor from within. It’s a shame as you have clearly paid a lot of money for the system. They need to be bigger for such a large hotel. I’ve never experienced anything like that !No aircon in the gym ! This is completely unacceptable. No windows or aircon. Husband spent 10 mins in there and had to leave.Slow service at the pool barSmelly bins near the pool bar , smelt like vomitBee bins ! I get the idea to recycle but they attract all the bees , many kids getting stung. You need wasp / bee traps around the pool. It also looks an eye sore.AV quality in the entertainment tent ( particularly for the little mermaid ) was terrible. Bass way to high. Team need to do a proper sound check. The storyteller you could not hear.Didn’t like the entertainment tent. It’s an eye sore looks cheap. Shame as the team work hard. It’s the large plastic walls , again not 5 star.Bar in the entertainment tent is terrible , slow and limited choice. It’s the busiest spot in the evening , just put a proper bar there with more staff !These are all minor things I get but to be honest combined makes me think your hotel is not 5 star.",Aug,2023,Aug 2023,2023-08-01,2023,2

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,wouterdepuydt,0,wouterdepuydtwrote a review Jul 2022,"Jupiter Albufeira is a beautiful hotel on the perfect location to discover the Algarve. They have excellent staff: friendly, comprehensive,… The rooms are spacious and clean, and most of them offer a balcony that look towards the swimming pool. Cleaning happens every day, where they for instance replace towels that you asked for. The food is good: there is plenty of choice and evert night you have different choices. The swimming pool in summer period is amazing: it is quite cold but very refreshing with the high temperatures in Albufeira. And if you still have doubts: the animation team is AMAZING. I think they are sponsored by Duracell as their batteries never seem to be empty :-)",Jul,2022,Jul 2022,2022-07-01,2022,4
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Emmadigney,1,Emmadigneywrote a review Feb 2015,"I stayed in Lisbon Destination for 3 nights in a 10 mixed dorm with my close friend and it really made the trip for us! The atmosphere was very welcoming and was conducive for other travellers to speak with one another. Through this we made great friends and learned about parts of the city we wouldn't have otherwise known about. It's location was really easy to get to the airport either by bus or metro and is within walking distance to many of the site seeing locations. Their facilities made it really easy to save a few bucks to cook in the hostel and the rooms are very clean with many bathrooms, never needing to wait. I would highly recommend it to anyone coming to Lisbon and I know if I return Lisbon I will be coming back to Destination.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,5
Lisbon Destination Hostel,nQthing,76,nQthingwrote a review Dec 2015,"The hostel is located in the train station which makes it extremely convenient to get to. Although its location is in a train station it is extremely safe. I was first greeted at check in with a warm hello and a \"welcome home\". The staff is all friendly and on point. The hostel is connected to two other hostels in Lisbon so the party usually triples when all 3 hostels meet up for the pub crawl. The hostels common room is the most unique common room I ever been to- a picture wouldn't do it justice because you can feel the homeyness and great atmosphere. The free hostels breakfast included pancakes and fresh fruit and they offer family meal for dinner.Great hostel with a great atmosphere and great staff",Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,5

Very nice hotel, with friendly staff, lots of lovely food to choose from all day and drinks as we were all inclusive.  Plenty of space to not feel crowded even if busy.  Rooms were very nice and spacious and very clean. Choice of pools for adults, and children with slides etc.  Plenty of sun beds.  Entertainment for adults and children in the evening was good, and daily activities by one of the pools in the day if you want to do it.  Free mini bus to the beach or old town at various times between 9 and 5.  Beach is walkable about 20 mins but a bit uphill coming back.  Lovely beach to sit on or walk along, with water activities.  Plenty of places to eat at.  The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to The Strip which has lots of bars and restaurants along it.

Casa Mitchell Apartments,David T,25,David Twrote a review Nov 2019,My wife and I stayed at these apartments between 3rd Oct and 17th October 2019.The apartments are a short downhill walk to the Old Town and the beach with some lovely bars and restaurants on the way.We stayed in Room 75 which was on the top floor (as we requested) overlooking the pool. We had a balcony which caught the sun for most of the day. The rooms were spacious and kept clean three times a week by staff. In between these days we put a broom around ourselves which was no problem at all since the room did not get very dirty. The kitchen was well equipped and we cooked our own breakfast every morning and ate it on the balcony. In the evenings we always ate out in the many restaurants in Albufeira. The free Wi Fi worked well in the room as did the air conditioning which was very welcome as everyday the temperature was in the mid 20s.The apartments appear to be run by Carla and another gentleman whose name I did not get. Both spoke perfect English and nothing was too much trouble for then - they were very helpful on several occasions. Carla even reccommened a couple of local restaurants which were very good.I would just like to thank Carla and her team for giving us a wonderful holiday. We have been to Albufeira three times before this visit but this was by far the best place that we have stayed in.,Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,5
Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,Rohanclan,2,Rohanclanwrote a review Jul 2017,"Very nice hostel.  We are a family of 6 and as such not the usual customers but it worked well.  People very friendly, nice atmosphere and fun games for the kids (and adults).  Excellent breakfast and you can make your own packed lunch which is great.  There is a supermarket right over the road and good cooking facilities although it can get a bit crowded in the kitchen sometimes.  A bit of a walk to the town and beach with kids (about 20 mins and 25 mins respectively) but not too bad.  No AC, could get a bit warm at night.  All in all if you accept that this is a hostel for mainly young people and you need to cater for yourself and pitch in with washing up and go with the flow it's a great place.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,4

The staff are what makes the hostel great, they were more than willing to take us out and show us a good time. Everything is very clean, and the common room and basement are a huge plus!

Saccharum,Levent G,2,Levent Gwrote a review Oct 2021,We had a wonderful stay at the Saccharum as a family of four. The hotel's design and its architecture is beautiful and the whole place is very well maintained. It occupies an enviable position overlooking the sea and there are great views from almost all outdoor areas. We thought the food at the buffet restaurant was excellent quality. Our kids particularly loved it and it was a real treat to watch the sun set over dinner from the outdoor terrace. While it may be a little quiet for some people we loved the fact that it's located outside of the capital. Some lovely little towns and villages are a short distance away and well worth a visit - ponto do sol is particularly nice. The marina is a few minutes walk away which is also particularly nice with some great restaurants - Leme was fantastic. The room was very comfortable and cleaned well. The turn down service each evening was a nice touch although the children now expect a chocolate to be delivered to them every night before bed! The only room for improvement for us was food at the poolside bar. Service was a bit slow but I think that can be attributed to the fact there was only one chef.All in all a fantastic place and we'd not hesitate to return in the future,Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,4

Royal Savoy Hotel,shoptilludrop007,42,shoptilludrop007wrote a review Nov 2011,"I stayed at the Royal Savoy with my mother and is was wonderful. We were upgraded to a suite on the 7th floor overlooking the sea and the cliffs of Madeira. The furniture is of a very high standard throughout the hotel. The living area was very spacious, good size kitchen with a dishwasher :), 2 good size bathrooms, a dressing room, a good size twin bedroom and a large balcony which was great because we are smokers and ashtrays were provided. The kitchen is great if you want to go self catering as there is a cooker and fridge as well as toaster, coffee machine and kettle. The shower was amazing, we wanted to take it home with us! The breakfast was a typical 5 star hotel breakfast, plenty of choice, hot and cold. The location of the hotel was perfect as it was only a good 10 minute stroll to the old town which was wonderful. There is long cobbled street in the old town which is well worth a visit, all the front doors of peoples houses are decorated in a different way, it was awesome. We packed a lot into our 6 days including The Botanical Gardens, Tropical Gardens, Santana, Pico De Ariero and Porto Moniz. Pico was incredible, it is worth the journey to the top of the mountains which is 1810 feet above sea level, you are above the clouds and you feel like you are in heaven, amazing feeling which cannot be captured by a photograph, take a jacket or shawl tough cos it was cold even though the temperature in Funchal Town Centre was 28 degrees! Santana was cute but you can see it in 15 minutes, cute pyramid houses. Porto Moniz was amazing, the colour of the sea is turquoise and the waves looked soapy like washing powder. Go to the restaurant down by the natural rock pools, food was lovely - had Portugese fish with banana, yummy, also take your swimsuit because you can swim in the rockpools. We took taxis most places because Madeira is extremely hilly, not for the faint hearted or for people with knee trouble. Taxis were very reasonable, about 5 euros to get here and there.Altogether a great holiday with beautiful weather, fabulous hotel and Portugese hospitality.",Nov,2011,Nov 2011,2011-11-01,2011,5

For people looking at reviews, points to consider:Good - staff, location by beach, quality of room.Poor -Breakfast - €25 pp - it's good but not worth €50 per couple. We walked to end of road for €6.50 plus drinks. Lots of restaurants offering breakfasts (most after 10am).Nespresso machine - €2 per capsule if you want to use this instead of packet Nescafe.Indoor pool - €11 pp per dayBar - expensive drinks, although 10% discount available.Individual air conditioning - despite complaining, never worked. Think they turn off main system in November (as experienced in other hotels).

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Caz K,26,Caz Kwrote a review Feb 2020,"Following a very enjoyable stay here in 2019 we recently returned for a 7 night winter break. The rooms are lovely, spotlessly clean with complimentary water, hot drinks and  bath robes. We found the staff at the hotel to be friendly, attentive, helpful and polite. Each morning we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. This is a buffet arrangement with an amazing choice of hot and cold food, There is also a great choice of drinks, including fizz! My husband celebrated a birthday during our stay and received a gorgeous cake and bottle of fizz which was delivered to our room. A lovely gesture, much appreciated. The hotel is ideally located for access to the beach and other local amenities. We had a relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable holiday and we would definitely visit again. Two small things which I would mention - there is only 1 chair available on the balcony which is very odd for a double room and the bath towels are quite small.

We ate lunch at the outside restaurant and found the prices similar to hotel prices in the UK.The marina was a 10 minute walk from the hotel and got very busy during the evening but had some very nice restaurants where we ate every night.The pools were clean and we always found beds even on the weekend when the hotel and area got a lot busier.Beds on the beach cost 20 euros for the whole day, we only went to the beach one day because the pool services at the hotel were so good.I would return back in the future for a short break.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,3

Natura Algarve Club,fergalfrog,53,fergalfrogwrote a review Jul 2016,"Firstly the pros. These are good sized and well equipped apartments. They are a little dated as previously mentioned but not bad at all. Rooms are a good size and in the one we had the kitchen, bedroom and living area were all separated. All the staff we met were very friendly and there is a small bar on site which was handy too. It is close all the action in Albufiera with a supermarket closeby and lots of good restaurants within walking distance.Now the not so good. This hotel is completely unsuitable for families/kids or anyone who is a light sleeper. We stayed here for 5 nights from July 15th to 20th and 90% or more of the guests were those between 18 and 25. The hotel is only a block or so away from the many night clubs/bars/discos/strip clubs etc on a street known as the strip. As a result Natura was full of teenagers and twenty something's who were there to party hard. Many of these were in large groups and in the time we were there we only saw one other family with kids. Lots and lots of noise in the evenings until they went out at between 10pm and midnight. They would then return between 3am and 6am with many not having keys and start banging on doors to wake up their drunken friends. The rooms all share a long corridor and despite there being lots of signs telling people to be quiet these are ignored. The first night we were there someone was banging loudly on a door near us for about 5 minutes at around 5am. This happened again around 6am and again on the third night we were there.We told reception about this twice. The first time we were told to call security when this happens (meaning during our stay we would have had to call security 3 times). In any case by the time security would have been up the person would probably be in their apartment. On the second occasion we were told the manager may wish to speak with us but this never happened.Even on the last night there we had an early flight and so were up at 5am. At that time a guy was knocking on door down the hall trying to get in to his apartment and we saw a number of others returning home from the night clubs at that time.The kids pool is not a kids pool. It is a kids pool full of adults (see photo). We really only used it early or late in the day (which is difficult as it closes at 7pm).Many of the nearby hotels will not take groups like this (stag/hen parties etc). Natura need to decide which type of guest they want to take - party animals or families. They cannot take both.If you are there for a stag/hen or there to party then this place is great. If you have kids or are over 25 you should seriously consider booking elsewhere.The staff, grounds, apartments are all great. Simply because of the clientele we certainly will not be returning to Natura Algarve Club.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,3
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Joana Q,1,Joana Qwrote a review Sep 2024,"I give a 3, not give 2 because despite everything gave to rest and it was nice.Cleanliness - 1* My room was for the pool (good location) but every night we had a visit of cockroaches, and I suspect I was bitten by one while I was sleeping (I leave for the swelling 3 days later).Night entertainment - 2* I found weak, although they have a large space for games and performances, they do not take advantage of it and do the performances in a corner where only half a dozen people can participate.Food - 3* They have potential, but for 4* the buffet has little offer, they gain in the possibility of being able to go to another hotel to eat and we can dine in typical restaurants of various nationalities. And they also offer several snack operations during the day.Location - 5* is good, beach 2 minutes walkThe pools are nice and the jacuzzi as well.Probably someone who didn't stay with the room next to the pool would have given a higher score, but having to deal with cockroaches when you want to rest is very bad.",Sep,2024,Sep 2024,2024-09-01,2024,3

Pestana Viking,Reddazzy,4,Reddazzywrote a review Oct 2019,"Would never go to this hotel again.  The reception staff are rude. When arriving at the hotel was informed could not get into the apartment until 4pm!!! The 2 bedroomed apartment was dated, whilst one bedroom had an en-suite bathroom with dressing table, full length mirror, double bed and balcony the bedroom I was in had no window, sliding door, in it was a wardrobe and 2 single beds and bedside table, it was dark, dingy and not pleasant. The bathroom we used had no extractor fan and soon steamed up. We had breakfast which was good. Not many restaurants around to stroll to. On the day of departure you have to be out of room/apartment by 10.00. This is not 4 star and needs some updating.",Oct,2019,Oct 2019,2019-10-01,2019,4

Eurostars Porto Douro,Hannah G,10,Hannah Gwrote a review Jul 2018,"Really recommend this place, was a great base to explore Porto, just 10 minutes walk to the riverside restaurants and bars, or across the bridge to the port-tasting houses. The panoramic views of the bridge and river can't be beaten and even though we hadn't paid the extra for a guaranteed river view, our rooms had spectacular views. The rooms were spacious with a great layout and facilities, and a little balcony. It was a high quality hotel for a reasonable price too.",Jul,2018,Jul 2018,2018-07-01,2018,5

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,mrs-roy-keane,17,mrs-roy-keanewrote a review Jun 2019,"Stayed here in June with my sister and 2 nephews. Would not recommend for families for 2 reasons, (1) the place is huge and kids could easily get lost and (2) due to the large number of stag and hen parties staying there. Very messy around the pool during the day and very noisy at night. The customer service is also poor, we had an issue with the safety deposit box and had to drop down to reception having been on hold for 25 mins (450 meters, 2 lifts and several sets of stairs later) I was told that his friend was busy with other guests and would call up â€˜laterâ€™, no timeframe as to when later might be! When I advised that I had been on hold for 25 mins I was told  that they were busy with other guests. On the plus side our apartment was spacious and clean although the shower hose had several leaks and could not avoid floor being soaked after a shower (reported this on day 1 but still the same on day 8!). Would not recommend.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,2
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,indiannie10,26,indiannie10wrote a review Feb 2015,"I enjoyed my stay here this year, but not as much as at the same time last year. It is a lovely hotel in a good location for the historical centre of the town and for shopping in the small shops on the way to the main square by the Roman Bridge. The staff are very good and pleasant on the whole and the place is kept very clean. All of that was perfect again this year but there were two issues which disappointed:1.This year the indoor pool and spa was out of action during my visit, which was a big let down for me. I found out only 2 days before my flight, so it was too late to cancel.2. The food was neither as good or as hot as it was last year. Sometimes food looked like it had sat in the heated buffet display too long and was often only tepid. Other times it was simply poorly presented, though on occasions it was set out more appetisingly. I suppose what I am saying is that it was inconsistent. There was plenty of it though, and the resutaurant was open several hours for each mealtime. The food cooked as required at the chef's station was usually the best choice IMO.This said, it is a pleasant place for some winter sun and warmth, if like me, you like some degree of peace and quiet without it being so quiet you feel uncomfortable. The staff are really welcoming whatever their positions. It is just a pity that the indoor pool was not available and the food wasn't as good as it had been last year. I would still return if in that area.",Feb,2015,Feb 2015,2015-02-01,2015,3

Sintra Marmoris Camelia,Charlie C,31,Charlie Cwrote a review Jul 2023,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights celebrating our anniversary. Gilda, one of the managers of the property helped check us in and was incredibly helpful during our stay. She also provided us free port and a small bottle of champagne and some insanely delicious chocolate truffles for the occasion. The room was very luxurious with a completely marble bathroom and huge blue drapes over the windows. The bed was so comfy I fell asleep immediately each day. I think I paid about $250 a night which felt like a steal for all that we got. They provided complimentary breakfast, it is sort of buffet style. You fill out a sheet the day before listing what you want. You can get as much as you want, it was on par with other luxury breakfasts, everything was fresh and delicious. The location is also very convenient. It is a 10 minute walk to the national palace and right by the train station. Maybe the best benefit of all was having access to the larger property which is a 10 minute walk in the opposite direction. There they have a pool, a beautiful garden and grounds to explore, peacocks, and a wine and cheese tasting every night along with Fado music and sometimes a magician. We had 0 complaints and would totally come back.",Jul,2023,Jul 2023,2023-07-01,2023,4

We were also welcomed with a nice personal message and some fruits and pastries in the room! Very kind!The is very well maintained and the decor really is spectacular.The breakfast was one of the best I’ve had in a city centre hotel - so much variety and everything was very fresh.The executive lounge had a wide variety of food and drink and offered a very good happy hour selection between 5pm and 7pm.Overall it was fantastic value for money and the location was perfect.One tip: don’t wait until the last day to enquire about the local buses like we did - Porto is very hilly so make use of the good public transport!",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,5

It is a 4 star hotel and we were able to get to on the Aerporto bus which left us almost at the door. Cost was 3.5 euro per person . It is a typical city hotel. The rooms are small but perfectly adequate for our City Break. The beds were very comfortable and very clean and the bathroom, while smallish was perfectly acceptable! We found the front of house staff were polite and knowledgeable and helped us plan our visit! We stayed on a b/b basis and found the breakfasts to be very good, with a mixture of hot and cold fare and continental ! The hotel is in a stylish area and is about 50 metres from the nearest Metro station. This gives a visitor access to the whole variety of the city's attractions and the 24 hour Metro pass is incredible value at 6 euro.My only minor gripe is that there is no iron or ironing board. There is an ironing service but it takes time and costs! It's nice to be able to get the creases out of my shirts and trousers!",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

In an accomodation like this, the staff should transmit the sensation of a familiar enviroment and attention to the guest.

Nothing formal, everything warmly practical – not only in the interior design, but also in the way the owners host their friends. Yes, indeed, visitors are treated here like friends, in the true spirit of the Portuguese hospitality.

Vila Galé Coimbra,Faustopereira1,3,Faustopereira1wrote a review Aug 2014,"We stayed as a family of four for 4 nights in August 2014.We arrived well after the booking in time but the room wasn't ready and had to wait for over an hour before we could finally go to the room. After some heavy prompting we were offered some complementary drinks.We booked a family suite and were underwhelmed by the room itself. Adequate but the view is the blank wall of the adjacent hotel and must be one of the few rooms with no balcony. Weren't planning to spend too much time in room so not too bothered.Staff in hotel are pleasant enough but the hotel is seriously under-staffed and as result the service is terrible. The queues at reception are pretty much always there at any time and on one occasion it took over 1/2 hour to just get a parking ticket validated. Everything has to be done at reception so even to get pool towels you have to queue. In order to get drinks at the bar you have to chase the staff out of the restaurant as the bar is not permanently manned. The service by the pool is terrible and staffed by what looks like a school leaver, who whilst pleasant, is totally snowed under by the work. At times, she also appears to be staffing the indoor bar at the same time.Our bedroom never got cleaned one day and there was no explanation for this.There are also problems with the hotel itself. The car park is a good example of how not to design a car park and 5 point turns are required just to get out!  It's an insult to charge clients 7.5 euros for such poor facility,The hotel was full in August but the number of sun beads near the pool was artificially kept low causing people to battle for one. Plenty of space available so no reason for this. The pool area is a good facility so it's a shame that it's spoilt by bad service and bad management.Food quality is good (if you can get it) but overpriced to match the four start rating.There aren't many options of restaurants nearby that you can walk to so it felt as if we were stuck in the hotel at times.In a country suffering from high unemployment my advice to management is to increase the number of staff in the hotel.Fausto Pereira",Aug,2014,Aug 2014,2014-08-01,2014,2
