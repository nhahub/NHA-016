Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,AbbeSteele,7,AbbeSteelewrote a review Mar 2012,"My partner and I have just come back from a week at the Belmar and it was gorgeous. Being out of season it was very quiet, we counted 6 couples during our entire stay but this meant it was like having the whole place to yourself! The apartments are fantastic, a beautiful high standard. The spa is great with a large gym and very impressive indoor pool which could be compared to the nicest spas I've ever been too! I can't say enough how lovely Sarah was who looks after the tratments, she takes her time and her advice was very helpful. We tried the restaurants on the beach which are less than a 5 minute walk away, and would recommend campamar for sure.. There isn't much else around so a taxi costs 5 euros into Lagos, again Lagos hasn't got that much going on but it's nice for a potter. If u had a car there are so many close places by. You'll be spoilt for choice. We can't wait to go again.",Mar,2012,Mar 2012,2012-03-01,2012,5
Villas Barrocal,Salisbury2010,2,Salisbury2010wrote a review Oct 2012,"Like many others I was a bit sceptical given the good price of this accommodation but the apartments were very spacious, clean and quiet. There's a nice pool area and the staff are very friendly.The cleaners came around several times during our week's stay and left the place spotless. There's lots of kitchen utensils too and it's very handy to have a microwave etc in the apartment.The only downside for us was the location. There isn't a huge amount to do in the village and it's a bit of a trek to get to the beach or the nearest town. We hired a car which solved this problem and I'd definitely recommend that anyone planning to stay there hires one (there's plenty of parking on site).",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,4
Saccharum,ChrisandSaraUK,57,ChrisandSaraUKwrote a review Oct 2016,What an amazing hotel - architecturally brilliant! The views from the roof (infinity pool and bar) are sensational. We loved the way the building is so in keeping with the previous industrial uses of the site.  Calheta is a lovely seaside village and a great base to explore Madeira.  The island itself is beautiful.  The only blemish - the food at lunchtime in the pool bar was incredible but the evening restaurants were less than 5 star. Plenty of nice places to eat in Calheta however including the Calheta Beach sister hotel where the a la cartel restaurant is great.  A special thank you to Jose Pereira who was a great help planning our trips around the island - you're a star! A could do better to the lady on reception who struggled  to smile or help us get the room we booked - got there in the end!,Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,4

Hotel Madeira,mkrn82,8,mkrn82wrote a review Aug 2011,"We stayed in the Hotel Madeira for a week at the end of August. The location of the hotel is it's main asset, it is nearly in the city centre and is only ten minutes walk from the old town, where there is a large choice of restaurants, some which are great value!The hotel doesn't have some of the facilities that a new resort style hotel may have, but it would seem a waste of a trip to be somewhere as stunning as Madeira and spend too much time in your hotel! Having said this, there is a roof terrace with a small pool that is nice to relax in! There are great views of the surrounding hills of Funchal and a bit of a see view, which I guess would have been stunning sea views before some more recent developments!The bar down stairs sells bottles of beer for 1 euro and some fairly priced snack meals! The room we were in was on the front corner had a good view of the hills and over looked the municipal gardens! It was spacious, clean, with clean towels and bedding everyday, and free Air con. The only down side was that we had no fridge, that would have been useful.The breakfast was quite basic, but not too bad, cheese, ham, rolls, boiled or scrambled eggs and cereal and fruit!The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, always willing to give advice with locations and directions.A must is a sight seeing tour with Strawberry World. They are based in the Monumental Lido area of Funchal, a 5 min bus journey on Line 1 from the see front. We did the South and East tour, which travelled trough stunning scenery with commentary giving a great insight into the island, from the guide who was great!",Aug,2011,Aug 2011,2011-08-01,2011,4
Macarico Beach Hotel,Helena N,3,Helena Nwrote a review Apr 2018,We were a  bit disappointed with the outside (because of all the construction)but as soon as we  entered the  hotel we were  greeted by some tasteful decoration   and an amazing clerck.  Mr Ângelo went above and beyond the call of his duty and even poured us some tea on  the common room while we played a game of chess.The room was simple but equipped with the basic amenities.We changed and headed straight for the spa floor where you can find the sauna and turkish Bath. You can regulate the temperature of all  equipments  to your own liking.  On the top floor you have the swimming pool and jacuzzi (also check the temperature on the dashboard).The breakfast is also fantastic so in overhall the hotel is well worth the visit.,Apr,2018,Apr 2018,2018-04-01,2018,4

Lisbon Destination Hostel,looseleafnz,0,looseleafnzwrote a review May 2015,"I get why this place is so highly rated as a hostel, the facilities are a definite step up from the standard however I booked a private room and my experience was poor.I am easy to please all I really need is a decent bed, a decent shower and wi-fi.  Lisbon Destination Hostel fails in two of the three areas.Their pillows are cheap, worn and well past their use by date.  They offer virtually no support and left me with a sore neck after a couple of nights.The upstairs shower takes a long time to get hot water.  There are signs all around about how eco-friendly they are but I don't know how eco being forced to run the shower for five minutes before it warms up.All the above would result in a mediocre score from me but unfortunately what drops the score further were the staff...It turns out that alot of the staff are volunteers (doing it for free board etc.) so it isn't the most professional operation but that's OK.What isn't OK was one of the girls who was a complete b....  err.. I mean she wasn't a very nice person.Also I needed to check out early in order to catch a train.  The reception desk is meant to be 24/7 but I was forced to spend 10 minutes hunting down the person who was meant to be on duty but had gone to sleep in one of the side rooms instead.  I nearly missed the train because of that.  I wasn't the only person affected -there was a group of girls locked out because there was no one around to \"buzz\" them in.The location is great and the facilities (apart from the shower) are great but the rest of it is not worth the hassle.  There are better options out there for the same money.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,2
Palacio Vila Flor,Bud33eboy,27,Bud33eboywrote a review Nov 2016,"This is a B&B in Alfama district of Lisbon. The office staff are friendly and helpful.It is a great location for discovering Fado in all the nooks and crannies of Alfama. It is an easy walk to the Lisbon Square and a host of good restaurants. It is also an easy walk to the train station. The rooms are small. We happened to get one on the top floor which required navigating a steep ladder like staircase. The door was only about 5' high and after you whack your head half a dozen times you learn to duck. We shared 2 bathrooms with 3 other rooms which meant getting dressed,whacking your head, navigating the staircase to the floor below then whacking your head on the way back for those middle of the night pees. Breakfast was included but nothing special. The price was right and worth the price. Hotels in Alfama are not abundant. We stayed 2 nights and that was about right.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,4
"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",JDLChester,34,JDLChesterwrote a review Jul 2019,"We visited the Pine cliffs resort in April 2018 during the Easter holidays with our children aged 7 and 1.On entering the resort there was a lot of building work going on but when we reached the ocean suites this building was away from the building site. The ocean suites building is lovely. From the beautiful flower displays on entering everything is just so. Check in was easy and quick but it was very quiet. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a lounge area in between the two bedrooms. This meant we had plenty of space and somewhere to chill in the evenings when the children went to bed.The appliances and kitchen were pretty much brand new with cooker, fridge/ freezer, dishwasher etc. The bedrooms were very modern, spacious and luxurious with main bedroom having an open plan bathroom and a free standing bath.The suite/ room is still one of the nicest we have ever stayed in. The complex is nicely set out but it is a bit of a trek if you have toddlers or babies down the steps to the beach. It was only April so not too warm but I can imagine in July it would be a challenge juggling a baby/ toddler and bags etc in the heat.The pools were too cool to use this early in the year so we used the indoor one.We ate in most of the restaurants but not all of them were open early in the Easter holidays. The whole complex was very quiet which gave it a slight odd feeling. I think when it got busier during the last 2 days of our holiday it gave it more of an atmosphere as more restaurants and shops etc were opening.For self catering there is a supermarket across the road with everything you may need. If you have a hire car ( would definitely recommend) there are plenty of Aldi and Lidl stores around too for food etc. Everything else out side the resort looks a bit run down but we found this with a few areas in Portugal as you’d expect with the financial status of the country.Overall I think the resort would be better during slightly busier times when everything is open and there will be more staff on during meal times to provide a speedier service in restaurants.The rooms were amazing though and we enjoyed our stay.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,186338Denise,50,186338Denisewrote a review Oct 2015,"We stayed recently in room 303 in this lovely hotel, we booked it after reading the excellent reviews on tripadvisor. The hotel is centrally located in a beautiful tree lined avenue. Our room was nicely appointed and spotlessly clean, very quiet too. The breakfasts were wonderful with a good variety of fresh fruits, meats, cheeses and delicious pastries. Freshly squeezed orange juice too. We ate one lunch and two dinners in the restaurant, all of which were excellent and reasonably priced. The hotel also has a small heated swimming pool in a pretty courtyard, a very nice bonus for a city hotel. The staff at the hotel were so friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to make sure guests are looked after. We had a fantastic time and would recommend without hesitation. Thank you Valverde hotel for making my Birthday special.",Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,5
Vila Galé Albacora,Malandpam,46,Malandpamwrote a review Oct 2013,"We stayed for one week All Inclusive towards the end of September and really enjoyed our holiday.We paid the supplement for a River View and are pleased we did, our room was lovely and we really enjoyed watching the boats come and go. The hotel is very nice, quiet and atmospheric with a real feel for the history and tradition of the area. We liked the peace and beauty of being out of town but it was lovely to visit Tavira too, it has a very traditional and welcoming atmosphere.We found everyone very friendly, staff were excellent and we absolutely loved the a la carte dinner which was part of our All Inclusive package.On the negative side:We did find some of the buffet food could be disappointing, what should have been served hot had often gone cold, but we still managed to find something nice to eat everyday.An onsite shop would be useful - there must have been one in the past but it seemed to have been replaced by a bike hire shop that was never open so there was nowhere to buy the little essentials, newpapers, sun creams etc.Towards the end of our holidays the outside bar/snack bar closed, and the beach boats stopped running, which was a shame.  If going again we would go a little earlier in the year to take full advantage of these two amenities.",Oct,2013,Oct 2013,2013-10-01,2013,4
Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,Victoria B,0,Victoria Bwrote a review Aug 2013,"Firsty I can already tell you that I can't describe all the love, care and fun we got at this hostel. This started as soon as I entered the front gate. The people of the hostel were just having one of there famous friday night bbqs and we got invited right away. In a few minutes we felt us more  welcome than we ever did in another hostel. The staff of this hostel (Wendy, Tanya and Dexter) is definately the key to the succes. They'll do everything to give you the best Lagosexperience you can imagine. They took us to most of the bars and some restaurants, made the nicest breakfast, did some great cooking, had some great drunken nights with us and became real friends.The rooms in the hostel are very clean and some even have their own bathroom. The other facilities of the hostel are also great, they have a nice pool area, pingpongtable and some nice 'chill' areas. Everything is very clean and nice refurbished.The hostel just offers everything for any kind of tourist, if you either come with a big group or by yourself, I'm sure you'll have the best time in the Algarve surf hostel.Can't wait to go back and see ya's in AMSTERDAM!!!! xxxxx Victoria",Aug,2013,Aug 2013,2013-08-01,2013,5

Clean and kept that way, helpful pleasant staff, The pool is not heated so chilly for swimming in March but acceptable.  One problem is lighting in the units, not adequate.  Another is the couch in the units (a hide-a-bed) is like a brick to sit on, very uncomfortable.  The pool area is nice, as is the bar, restaurant area and upper deck and hot tub location.

Hyatt Regency Lisbon,Diego O,0,Diego Owrote a review Oct 2024,"What an outstanding stay we had at Hyatt Regency Lisbon! From the moment we stepped in, the hotel felt like a home away from home, radiating warmth and style at every corner. The rooms were spacious, impeccably clean, and full of thoughtful amenities that made our stay ultra-comfortable.I have to give a special shoutout to the reception team, especially for their service late at night. We arrived much later than expected, exhausted from our travels, but the night staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. They went above and beyond, checking us in quickly and making sure we had everything we needed for a smooth start to our stay.Throughout our stay, every member of the staff was friendly and eager to help, whether it was for restaurant recommendations, directions, or just a friendly chat.If you’re looking for a place where service, comfort, and kindness come together beautifully, don’t miss out on Hyatt Regency Lisbon. We’ll definitely be back! 🌙🛏️✨",Oct,2024,Oct 2024,2024-10-01,2024,5
Luna Clube Oceano,Derekcgb,6,Derekcgbwrote a review Jun 2012,"Just back from 2 weeks in Clube Oceano.  The one bedroom apartment had a large lounge with an enormous couch and a good sized balcony.  All rooms face the pool. We decided against a studio as they are half below pool level and lack privacy.  The difference in price was small.  Although the flat was kitted out for self catering we didn't even boil water so can't comment on the kitchen but there was a cooker, microwave, toaster and coffee maker with crockery & cuttlery.  We made full use of the fridge. As others have said some furniture & fittings look rather tired but everything worked and we were comfortable.  Daily cleaning, exept Sunday, and frequent towel changes.  My bed was made perfectly each day.  No charge for air conditioning and there's a sturdy safe in the bedroom.  I think I paid €30.00 + €15 returnable deposit on the key for 2 weeks.  There are 2 liftes.Reception staff all helpful & friendly & spoke English.  The pool and pool bar are operated by another company so you can't take your own food and drink to the pool but their prices are reasonable.About a 15 minute walk into the old town up & down hill. Taxi prices to and from the old town are reasonable, around €5.00 including a tip.  A bit farther to the new town and \"strip\".People with walking problems might find the hill back up from the beach a challenge, it's not long but quite steep.  Hills are a fact of life in Albufeira.  Hard to avoid them.Altogether a comfortable 2 weeks.",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,4

Breakfast always has a great choice, one of the best we have found and the meals we had there delicious and fresh. We went to the Murder Mystery dinner and enjoyed it thouroughly.

Saccharum,Diego,2,Diegowrote a review Sep 2021,"No music by any of the pools is a huge fail, I can understand having a peaceful pool at a hotel pool but when you have 5 pools with zero atmosphere at every pool the experience becomes awkward. The buffet dinner was questionable to say the least, I’d recommend you eat out. I had a burger from the bar by the pool, was hugely overpriced and probably the worst burger I’d eaten In my entire life. Hopefully they start catering for paying customers rather than living in the ignorance of being attached to the savoy group, I found the female staff very helpful and friendly but the male staff were polar opposites moody ignorant and arrogant. Personally I’d never go back as I like to get what I pay for. This hotel is not cheap however they have a cheap mentality and should respect customers needs and wishes more than they do.

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",swilliams330,26,swilliams330wrote a review Sep 2018,"This was our second stay at Reid's, a visit chosen to celebrate my husband's birthday. From the moment we arrived, we felt warmly welcomed and were treated with genuine care and skilled service by all staff whom we encountered. Rarely is any hotel so consistently fine in the quality of its service--from reception and concierge, bellman, housekeeping, food and bar service, pool and ocean swimming staff--every person we met exhibited professional skill and true hospitality. The staff ultimately make a hotel experience outstanding, and because the guests, as well as the building and furnishings of Reid's Palace are so well-cared for, one's stay is very relaxing and pleasant in every way. Our dining experience at William (the Michelin-starred restaurant at Reid's) was sublime, and again, exceptional and gracious service was provided. The chef's beautiful and creative dishes are outstanding, and the Michelin recognition is certainly well-deserved. We enjoyed the assistance of the friendly sommelier to pair wines with each course. Reid's Palace is a truly luxurious hotel experience to be savored by anyone who appreciates beauty and quality served with genuine warmth and a complete lack of cool reserve or snobbery. On the contrary, gracious service is offered to all, equally, for the guests to enjoy.",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Trevor124,10,Trevor124wrote a review Apr 2018,"We had a very good, spacious, clean room overlooking Quateira. We preferred this to a more expensive room which faced in the opposite direction, towards Vilamoura but not overlooking it unless you were on the very top floors, more likely you would be just overlooking the casino and also possibly hearing more external noise.  The food was very good, especially the breakfasts and the waiter service was of a very high standard. Entertainment at night was enjoyable but unfortunately not fully appreciated by many as it had to compete with football on TV, pool playing nearby and groups talking at tables.  We were made very welcome at the hotel.  The hotel is well placed giving easy access by walking to Vilamoura marina and also the fishing port at Quarteira in the opposite direction.",Apr,2018,Apr 2018,2018-04-01,2018,4
Solar dos Poetas,Monique68,8,Monique68wrote a review Sep 2024,"Central hotel in a strategic position to reach both on foot and by public transport squares, monuments, museums, etc.A few steps away in the square of the hotel is the terminus of tram 28 (famous Lisbon tram) so the possibility to sit without queues as for other stops. Also convenient tram 12 always in the square.Nearby is also the metro stop and the Santa Justa elevator.The rooms are spotless and even if they overlook the street very quiet (windows that close perfectly), polished and impeccable parquet. Small but comfortable bathroom.Breakfast served in a retro room with windows overlooking the square offering a wonderful view and also a pianist in an adjacent room plays for guests during breakfast creating a relaxing and special atmosphere.Varied breakfast (sweet and salty) excellent, varied and plentiful.The staff was friendly, smiling and helpful.Antonio, Marcos and Jenifer really welcoming and nice peopleIf I return to Lisbon I will definitely stay at this hotel.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,David P,1,David Pwrote a review May 2022,"So we have been here five days and have another five nights to go, we had to complain to reception twice on our fifth day to have clean bedding an our bin emptied the cleaner took our towels an not replaced them, phoned reception again an still waiting for towels.Now comes the major problems with this hotel firstly DONT expect a good night's sleep as there is a deep base thump from 10pm to 3.30am from bars on the strip, I have stayed at the MGM across the road to the rear of this hotel an never heard deep base before.  Secondly this hotel policy is NO STAG & HEN or large single sex parties but it is full of them, you can't get round the pools for large groups of males or females shouting,  swearing etc,  groups leaning over balconies shouting down to the pool. THIS IS NOT A QUIET FAMILY BASED HOTEL, contacted JET2 Holidays today, so fingers crossed our problems will be resolved.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,2

Hotel Gat Rossio,Mcr-traveller13,139,Mcr-traveller13wrote a review Oct 2012,"I'd stayed in a few Gat properties previously so know what to expect when I arrived for my first-ever stay at the Gat Rossio - value-for-money funky designer-style hotels.Firstly the location of Gat Rossio is excellent- just off the linked two main squares at Rossio and Restauradores. The metro stop exit at Restauradores is literally 30m from the hotel door, but Rossio is only 1-2 mins walk also. Here you are right in the heart of wonderful Lisbon, with metro, trams, trains, etc, to all parts of the city within a few mins walk.The rooms are small, but compact and clean.  The bed was big & very comfortable, with excellent quality linens.  My bathroom was equally compact, but was well thought-out had very good quality toiletries (from Korres).  The free wi-fi worked perfectly and although not superquick was very reliable. Some people won't like the clothes storage system in the rooms, but I'm not one of those people who a) travels with a ton of clothes or b) insists on hanging up everything in my suitcase all at once, so it was OK - my only small gripe was that there was nowhere to hang trousers (please take note hotel management!).  Also for people who are light sleepers ask for a room facing inwards, as the rooms facing the street get a lot of noise from 5/6am onwards as the restaurants below receive deliveries.The service from the staff was always helpful and friendly, and they have a few really nice touches - for example, every day a bottle of water & a brown bag of local fresh fruit was left in the room, and you can print off boarding passes from the computer in reception without charge.Breakfast is excellent - good choice, good quality and fresh.  Staff were constantly replenishing supplies, and even though the seating space can get busy the staff were constantly clearing plates, etc, to create space.  The outside terrace looked lovely & peaceful, alas I was there during unseasonably wet & cold weather so never had chance to use it.All in all I think this hotel is an excellent choice.  It's not a 5-star business hotel, but then it doesn't try to pretend that it is. But it has a great location in a fabulous city, great service, good quality and is excellent value-for-money.  Highly recommended.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Nick B,15,Nick Bwrote a review Oct 2014,"We stayed here as a group of four on a golf weekend, the hotel was ideally located for the golf, the beach and only a short stroll from the port with lots of bars and restaurants.The internal decor of the hotel was a little dated and tired, for example on the first floor lift area there was a big seat which had a large lamp and shade, which was damaged and askew. The rooms were comfortable, not better than that with random bit missing from the three rooms that we had, for example no coffee or tea making facilities in one of the rooms.Some of the staff, I stress not all, but you tend to remember the bad bits, l;eft us with a feeling of being an annoyance for them rather than a house guest. For example one of our number had booked an extra room on the web prior to arrival, on arrival this was queried and in spite of having e-mail confirmation the rate was disputed and the whole transaction took far longer than it should have.Many of the staff were good, and a pleasure to deal with, it was such a shame that a few spoilt the experience.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,3

Hotel Gat Rossio,Vera,147,Verawrote a review Dec 2015,"Our experience with this hotel was a \"mixed bag\". First, location is excellent, the hotel is located right next to Rossio Square, which is very convenient. The price was good too. I booked the hotel for our 10th wedding anniversary trip. I paid for a larger upgraded room--Double Superior. Since this was a special occasion, I had a special room request and checked on it twice. Both times staff confirmed. I also informed them that due to our flight, we would be getting in later, around 7-8 p.m. When we arrived and saw our room, I was really displeased: it had no balcony, was not on the 5th or 6th floor, and instead of street view, there was a backyard view or a dilapidated building. When we came back to the lobby and asked for another room, we were told 1) the hotel was full and 2) the room I requested did not exist. Why did the staff confirm my request on two separate occasions? If I knew that what I wanted was not possible, I would either get a different hotel or get over it before our arrival. Also, the room did not seem to have the 20 square meters advertised for Double Superior, it seemed smaller. After a while of arguing, the receptionist told us to move out the next day before 10 am and come back after 3 pm with a promise of a better room. The second room was a little better--4th floor, not front view, but a view into a small back street, it also seemed to be the advertised 20 square meters in size. Unfortunately, we were not able to unpack and lost 1/2 day with moving. The first night, I was so upset, that we considered moving to a different hotel and checked a few in the area, but the one I liked was full.The breakfast was good and plentiful, just got a little repetitive after 5 days: several kinds of savory pastry, 2 kinds of sweet pastry, you can boil your eggs; cold meat cuts, cheese, yogurt, cereal, make your own coffee/tea, squeeze your own orange juice. I noticed that whether we came early or late, the breakfast room was always busy. However, the staff was working diligently to replenish quickly disappearing items. Because of the room set up, it was not possible to sit at a separate table and have privacy, so I noticed that some people were taking their food on the deck outside. The rooms had free internet access, I just noticed that we had an issue with the number of plugs available in our room in comparison to the number of devices we needed to charge.The rooms are modern, clean, and look pretty good in pictures, but small and the furnishings are a little impractical. For me, there was a lack of hangers and since they don’t have classic wardrobes with doors, everything you take out of your suitcase will be out on display. Also, the bathrooms in both rooms were pretty small, but that is to be expected in European cities anyway.One great thing they did for us was the breakfast they packed for us on the day of our departure. We had to leave very early on Sunday morning and to our surprise, they were willing to prepare us to-go bags and have them ready for us at the reception. We appreciated that the staff was helpful and reserved a taxi for us, so we could get to the airport very early on Sunday morning. However, we had a problem with a wakeup call. We asked about the taxi ride 2 days ahead to make sure we have enough time to figure it out if they could not help us. While my husband used their assistance to get a taxi to the airport, he also asked for a wakeup call for the morning of our departure. To our surprise, we were woken up very early (around 4 or 4:30 a.m.) a day before our departure. Unfortunately, we stayed up until about 2 am the night before and I was not able to fall asleep after the call. The receptionist apologized for the mistake made by a coworker and promised to set up the wakeup call for the next morning—our departure date. Unfortunately, this wakeup call never happened and we almost overslept, which would mean missing our flight. Fortunately, we also set up an alarm on a cell phone, but as we were expecting a wakeup call, we snoozed a couple times and got up late, so this was not a good start to the day. The staff was not willing to compensate us in any way for the two wakeup call mishaps. My husband asked that the hotel pay for our ride to the airport to compensate us for all the trouble, but they refused, so this left a negative last impression.Overall, this is a decent budget hotel, but for my taste, there were too many mishaps. Would we come back? I don’t know, maybe, if I would be unable to find a better place to stay in Lisbon.",Dec,2015,Dec 2015,2015-12-01,2015,2

Perola da Lagoa,Peter H,30,Peter Hwrote a review Jul 2009,"10 July 2009First time reviewer, LancashireOur family have just returned from Perola da Lagoa complex near Obidos Lagoon on the Silver Coast. The complex 's shared pool has been closed and a lot of the pavements are overgrown. The small playground consisted of two swings, one of which was broken and a small slide. There was no-one to complain to on-site as the management company's office was closed. There are more properties currently being built, even though we were one of about only six properties being occupied on the whole complex.  According to the advertisment board there is going to be a golf course and a hotel plus a tropical lagoon (the closed pool!)It was a shame about the complex as our villa was very nice and well equipped. You do need a car in this area.However once away from the complex , the area is lovely and unspoilt. The lagoon beaches are great for children and very safe. Nazare water park is well worth a visit although much smaller than those on the Algarve. It caters well for toddlers upto young teenagers. Obidos town is well worth a visit as is Peniche with great fish restaurants. Many of the restaurants do a lunch time meal of the day including main course,sweet and drink for 6-7euros.",Jul,2009,Jul 2009,2009-07-01,2009,2

The location was perfect as the hotel is in Belem,  a quiet, but active section of the city right on the river.  We conveniently walked throughout the area and found several nice restaurants, but also caught the train (a stop conveniently located nearby) several times to go into the city center and other tourist spots and to the beach areas.  The hotel was perfect, the staff very attentive and the rooms modern and comfortable.  We enjoyed our room and the balcony as it had a beautiful view of the river.We spent several hours in the spa, enjoying a couples' massage, and several other treatments. So glad we did!  The staff is very professional, experienced, and knowledgeable about  both the treatments and products available.  The costs were reasonable for the multiple services that are provided.  The heated pool was also very nice.The daily breakfast was lovely, with a variety of warm breakfast items, as well as various meats, cheeses, breads and cereals.

The hotel itself is clean and the rooms comfortable, our room was at the front of the hotel, so we had no sun, the reception staff were very helpful and did offer to change our room when one with a sunny aspect became vacant, but as we were only there for one week we didnt bother.  Breakfast was buffet style, nothing spectacular, but ok. There were a lot of English Saga guests staying there, on all inclusive, and many golfers from Ireland.  The outdoor pool was always busy with sunworshippers. All in all we found the hotel to be what we wanted, the Portuguese were really helpful and friendly.  Tavira is a lovely town, with so many restaurants we loved it.  We particularly enjoyed eating at Simoa's, which was always full of locals, the food was great and very reasonably priced.

We choose this hotel from selections available to us in our Azores Getaways package and we are glad we did.  We wanted to stay on the coast.  The property was recently renovated and our room was spacious and airy with sea views and the maid service did a very nice job.  The room was equipped with a nice TV, mini fridge, the usual bath products, hair dryer and the bed was comfortable.  Being an older property the shower in our room was a step over bath tub design that some might find difficult getting in and out of.  Breakfast was serviceable and ample and changed a bit everyday.  Omelets and cooked to order eggs available and even Mimosas, the coffee could use an upgrade however. We had wine several evenings in the bar and it was not too expensive.  We might have been there during off season so the evening restaurant only had a set price fixed menu.  It was not priced badly at 22 Euros and several of the menus we looked at looked inviting, however the one evening we did consider dining in, the selections weren't quite to our liking so we passed.  Our limited interaction with staff and check in and out was pleasant and everyone was friendly.  The grounds are groomed nicely, a beach, two pools and tennis courts are on property.  We had a rental car so getting around was not a problem.  I believe you can rent a car at the hotel.  The hotel has an interesting past and is twined to the Monte Palace if you are curious and want an interesting read.We would certainly stay here again and would recommend it as an option if you are staying on Sao Miguel.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4

The rooms are very spacious, the hotel is beautifully decorated, and is right on the ocean. But... there is nothing in the surroundings. It costs about 25€ per taxi from the airport and 20€ to the capital Ponta Delgada and about 10€ to the nearest village. So... if you don't have a car, you're either stuck or you spend a lot of money in taxis. Or... if you're lucky, you can get a free ride into town but you have to book in advance and... if the van is full, they won't ride again unless they have a party of six.I found the food ok but rather expensive (22€ without drinks for a buffet dinner) and the drinks are pricey too (3€ for a glass a soda). There are no coffee or tea facilities in the room and no shop in the hotel or nearby where you can get a paper or a soda.This would be a perfect hotel for an 'all inclusive' stay.
