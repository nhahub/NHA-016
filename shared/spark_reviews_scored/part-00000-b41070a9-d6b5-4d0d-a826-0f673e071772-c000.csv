Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Sandra,0,Sandrawrote a review Jul 2025,"We had a wonderful stay in Hotel Jupiter Albufeira.   The staff are a credit to this hotel they work so hard to provide such an excellent service and are so friendly and pleasant.  The hotel inside and out was immaculate.  Food was great couldn't fault it great selection for all meals and was delicious and staff were so efficient and friendly.  Pools and slides great fun and the swim up pool was a big  hit again the staff here never stopped.  Beds so comfortable and rooms nice and spacious we stayed as a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids 12 and 9 and we had plenty space.One small thing the lounge area inside the bar was so grey and gloomy the walls were bare, we didnt spend any time there, a few small changes here in the colour and decor would make this space more inviting it just needs a bit of character.Overall an excellent holiday we all thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thank you Jupiter",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,4
Hotel Madeira,Steve P,11,Steve Pwrote a review Mar 2017,"The central location of this value for money hotel is its best feature.The rooms although not palatial are clean and functional. The walk-in shower is excellent with loads of hot water. The beds are comfy and there is tv and wifi.There is a swimming pool (unheated) and bar area on the roof which is very pleasant when it's sunny.The breakfast is fair for the 3 stars this hotel has.Step out of the front door and everything is to hand, all in all it represents great value.",Mar,2017,Mar 2017,2017-03-01,2017,3
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Denis o,0,Denis owrote a review Sep 2025,"Arrival a breeze, the staff member checking us in actually came out from behind the desk to show us lifts, breakfast area and to have a conversation regarding the other facilities. Such a simple gesture but so personal. The One is the main restaurant, food beautiful. Everything is spotlessly clean. The views over the cave system, cliffs and sea are glorious. Guests did not arrive at 06.30 with towels to reserve sunbeds, very civilised. There were more than enough beds anyway. Very close to Carvoeiro, you could walk, we drove! Was HOT. Lots of carparking. Above all, the staff were so friendly. Rarely would staff in a hotel deliberately stop to have a chat or share a joke but the Tivoli staff do. Only improvement I can think of is relating to the balcony. Would be nice to have either more comfortable chairs or a lounger along with an umbrella as I found you had to keep moving the chairs to catch the shade from the walls on each side of your outdoor area. Prices do reflect the star rating, a beer that cost €2.50 in Carovoeiro cost €6 in the hotel but you are not going to get the same level of service and comfort in the town so, you know what, I don't mind in the least.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,4

Hotel Madeira,richard s,4,richard swrote a review Sep 2016,"We spent a week on Madeira at another hotel however our return flight was cancelled and we needed to overnight until next available flight-we found hotel Madeira and didn't expect much as it was high season and the island was fully booked.  to our great and pleasant surprise we found ourselves in a bright scrupulously clean small and prefectly formed hotel right in the centre of the old town in F.unchal. Naturally after spending the previous 17 hours on the airport floor we went to bed and slept the afternoon away. We awoke to find that Funchal was closing its doors as there were raging forest fires spreading in the high winds into the town. we went up to the rooftop bar to get some food and the chap there carried on and made us food even while he was receiving calls from his family to update him on their situation-he never left his post -other guests had ran out leaving their drinks etc behind as the fire was two streets away.  Emergency services ordered us to be evacuated. Eduardo (manager) & Duarte -we didn't get all of the names of the staff were amazing and helped everyone and ensured all the guests were removed to safety. Sandwiches, snacks and drinks werre provided until the emergency was over. We returned to Hotel Madeira at 3.00am. Breakfast was layed out early as normal but would run until late to allow other guests to catch up on lost sleep. I cannot express just how brilliantly the staff carried out their duties to all the guests-we could never thank them enough. All in all we left wishing that we had spent our week in Hotel Madeira -friendly, chilled, quietly confident and excellent value for money..",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,2
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Lauren B,0,Lauren Bwrote a review Aug 2025,"Just returned from a 10 night family holiday at this hotel and I had to write a review about how amazing it was! This hotel really has everything you could want/need. Everywhere was so clean and staff were constantly cleaning up any spillages/mess from any guests. The staff are also so friendly and we’re always saying hello and interacting with our children. They went above and beyond to cater for mine and my little boys allergies. They made us fresh dairy free meals including desserts for every meal times and even had dairy free icecream whenever we requested it throughout the day. The day time and the evening entertainment was brilliant and it was a bonus that the children could go on trampolines, a bouncy castle and cars in the evenings too (however this was at an extra cost). The pool set up was great as it’s suitable for all ages with a baby pool, toddler slides, slides for older children/adults and then the bigger pool. There was always enough sunbeds for people which was a bonus too. It’s brilliant that there’s so many activities for children to do in the day if they want a break from the pool such as football, baking, competitions, games room etc. It really was the best family hotel we’ve been to and we will defo be returning!",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,5

The staff were friendly and attentive at all times.The buffet breakfast was superb, I can't comment on the dinner as we ate out every evening.Our room had fantastic views over the sea and swimming pool.There was always space around the pool and was quiet.Even though we were in Covid times the staff still mananged to make the experience almost like pre Covid times which must be difficult as the hotel was nearly full.There are plenty of restaurants to choose from in Carvoeiro",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,5

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Christine O,6,Christine Owrote a review Aug 2018,The 2 bedroom apartment was nice and spacious.At check in a male receptionist was quite rude and  unhelpful rushing us through the process. There is no porter to help you with bags to the apartments which are up a hill. Had to carry or pull.I asked for a late check out way in advance but was rudely told off! I was told to be out at 12noon despite my passionate request. We were thrown out and had to carry left overs to eat at restaurant. Restaurant manager refused to warm the food. After begging he agreed but told us to go outside and eat it. Literally on in the car park or street. My family felt racially profiled. After 4 days of a fully paid stay a customer must never be treated as a nobody at check out! UNACCEPTABLE and it’s a shame. Buyer be ware especially if you are a minority as their treatment of us was not equal.,Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,1

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,S.,1,S.wrote a review Aug 2022,"The hotel itself is nice inside and the room and pool area were alright. However, the service was really bad, specially for what is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.1. We could never reach the room service number.2. We were given a voucher for a welcome drink. When we went to the bar to get our drink, we were seated but never served for a full 30mins. We left and the staff never noticed we weren’t even served. We complained at the reception and they said they would make it up for us and we would be compensated, but nothing was done.3. Our stay, which was booked by an agency, was supposed to be a VIP guest experience and was meant to included a “Surprise gift”. We were given a plate of grapes and told that was the surprise gift. There was also a bar of soap gifted to us another day. Overall it seemed underwhelming for what was meant to be a VIP experience.4. The food in the restaurant was ok. I could see they were trying to do sophisticated dishes but they were not up to the standard we were expecting. The linguini was actually really tasty, but the duck was cold and dry.Overall the staff seemed unprofessional and not too pleasant. I don’t think it’s worth the price so I would not stay here again.",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,2

Catch a bus or the metro for transportation Loads of taxis around. Excellent accommodation. Breakfast was cooked individually and well presented. Outdoor atmosphere is perfect for a late night out or a walk, but not very good during the day though. The bar and the restaurant is nice, with a pool. Our rooms were prepared carefully twice a day, which is a plus, too.Thoroughly recommend this for couples or families.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,5
Hotel Madeira,chrismCambridgeshire,246,chrismCambridgeshirewrote a review Jan 2025,"First impressions matter and our first impression of the Hotel Madeira was not good when we were checked in by a rather grumpy unsmiling gentleman.  Fortunately all the other staff were cheerful and helpful.  We had a suite which was roomy with a comfortable bed and a sitting area.  The rooftop bar was very pleasant with reasonably priced drinks and snacks - although a pigeon flew in to eat all out peanuts.  Breakfast was ok, rather than special although redeemed in my wife’s eyes at least by the pastéis de nata that were provided on the last two days.  So we gradually warmed to the Hotel Madeira and would not be averse to staying there again.",Jan,2025,Jan 2025,2025-01-01,2025,3

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,wgroves,83,wgroveswrote a review Nov 2011,"Our last night in Portugal was near the airport. So we chose this Marriott. It was difficult to find. We had hamburgers in the restaurant which were OK. Due to the location being so far from the downtown area, and we were tired, we stayed in. The bar wouldn't let us eat a pizza from the restaurant in the bar. We were playing cards so had to go to our rooms to eat. We had a great deal of room noise during the night. A very steady, loud hum. The room was fine. What I expect in a Marriott. So when we left at 4AM for the airport, a taxi was there for us.",Nov,2011,Nov 2011,2011-11-01,2011,4

Vila Galé Albacora,Evie30,89,Evie30wrote a review Jul 2005,"We stayed at the Vila Gale Albcora on 8th July for 4 nights, 2 girls for a long weekend of sun and relaxing. The Hotel it's self is pleasant, a bit in the middle of nowehere but this does not matter as there is a shuttle bus that goes from the hotel to its sister hotel in the Town every few hours. The town is quaint, rather dusty, with cobbled streets and some rather derelict buildings, a few shops, bars and restaurants. There is a very old castle that you can go and visit also, beware of the steep steps with NO handrail, for me going up was easy but coming down is a different story. The views are great.The Hotel was okay, we had a lovely room situated by the pool, room 212, would reccomend it, standard double room with its own very small garden. The pool area was well kept and clean and the pool was huge! The food i personally thought was horrid, on our first night we went to the hotel BBQ outside, there were millions of mosiqutos but the restaurant manager gave us a insect stick to rub over our arms and ankles, i didnt get bitten but my friend got eaten alive. The food had been left out for a few hours (BBQ 7pm-11pm) and was soggy and i didnt risk eating much as none of it was refrigerated, it was €18 each, €10 would have been better. But this did include free wine, beer or Sangria (which was yummy!). The Bar staff during the day were very rude and would stand around chatting, when you tried to get their attention they seemed to get ruder! How dare i ask for a drink at the bar kind of thing ! Breakfast was not bad actually, lovely strong coffee, breads and ham, cheese and hot English style breakfasts, big selection of fruit, but we decided that it was the same fruit 3 days in a row and on the 3rd day it was fizzy, again not properly refridgerated. Dinner in the restaurant was a buffet and probably all left overs from the BBQ the previous night, yuck!  The male restaurant manager knew nothing about the hotels wine, neither did the waiters, even tho there were about 20 on the menu he could not describe 1, so we stuck with water. We would highly reccomend that you go out for dinner, cabs are only €6. We found 2 delightful restaurants on Quatros Argus, lovey waiters, lovely food, lovely views and atmosphere. You can also get a water taxi to the hotel for €8 from the restaurants.The BEACH, for €1.50 you can get a ferry to the hotels private beach, this is a nice relaxing day out, lovely beach with a small bar serving sandwiches and drinks, umbrella and sunbed hire was €11, the hotel staff dont tell you this.The reception staff were not that plasant except for one chap called Luis, he was very funny and helpful, the female manager and other female staff were very rude and made our check out a nightmare, long story.The hotel is most suitable really for families, there were 100's of kids there, of all nationalties, it would not be the most romantic place for couples because of this, but for 2 girls who wanted a relaxing cheap holiday it was ok.I personally would not go back to the hotel, but would reccomend it.",Jul,2005,Jul 2005,2005-07-01,2005,3

Location is great, short walk to the beach and easy walk along the beach to Old Town. Short walk to Continente grocery store for groceries or shops next door have a few grocery items too. Front desk staff always friendly & helpful. Room was clean & comfortable, only complaints were the small coffee cups, dull knives in kitchen, odd placement of microwave on shelf under stove & WIFI didn't work in bedroom area but great in rest of the unit. Rooms were quiet with nice view of the ocean.

From thr moment we were greeted at the door to our entire stay we felt welcomed and part of the Royal Savoy family. We went with our 18 year old son and had asked for our rooms to be together. This was not possible but we were both upgraded to a superior room and to be honest I think my son was happy to be more independent anyway. The food is exceptional, so much we only ate out twice and the hotel and grounds are clean and tidy. The rooms are spacious with the best equipped kitchen I have seen at a hotel. All this said, what makes this hotel so special is all the wonderful staff who are so welcoming and nothing is too much.

Communication was excellent and the hotel arranged transport for four of us from the airport and then to the port on our departure, just as well as it’s quite hard to find due to being on top of an ice cream shop!

The rooms are fit for a King or Queen . Nothing is to much to you because you are a Guest not a customer. The meals perfect and the Staff aim to make you feel special. The grounds and swimming pools, and Massage add to the experience. Yes Reid’s is not a Hotel it is an Experience to be cherished. My hope is I can return to the lovely people of Reid’s.

Royal Savoy Hotel,liv,0,livwrote a review Jul 2022,"(please take the time to read)my family used to own a time share here so we went every summer, for 10 years straight. we never wanted to go anywhere else because of the amazing atmosphere of the hotel and the part of the island that it stands. the last 2 years we havent been able to go because our time share ran out however we just bought the room again for the next 11years and the entire family cannot wait. the staff are incredibly friendly, the pools are a wonderful place to hang out, i learned to swim in them when i was little, and the readily available ice creams at any given moment just make it even better. this hotel is where i spent most of my childhood and im so glad my parents picked this one over a decade ago. its close to the airport but has amazing views between the hotel and your flight, the hotel has deep sea diving, windsurfing etc. NEXT DOOR, its attached to a wonderful garden which you can walk through to take you to town which has many bakerys and shops, and the area although easy to get around in a car and bus is very easy for walkers, you can get virtually anywhere on foot and very easily. not to mention but the hotel also has  a little 'lighthouse' which you can see in the photos which is yellow and directly next to it is stair access to the sea as well as a rock which we called 'the jumping rock' which you literally can jump into the sea from, it is SO MUCH FUN. although i spent a lot of time in this hotel as a child, it doesnt mean its one of those 'theres kids running around everywhere' type of places, its still very romantic, quiet but somehow also theres a lot of things to do and lastly it feels very classy. its going to be the highlight of my year going back to this place i cant recommend it enough, pure heaven on earth.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Simon A,35,Simon Awrote a review Sep 2017,"The levels of service and quality at this hotel do not meet the high expectations required by IHG.  This is the 3rd time I've stayed.  The last time being 2 and 3 years ago. Standards have continually slipped.The quality and condition of sunbeds and cushions (half the beds have no cushions - so very uncomfortable and they are all stained and ripped) and bedding and towels in room are very old and discoloured.  Breakfast poor with food cold and very poor selection for a 5* hotel.  This is by far the worst Crowne Plaza I've stayed and will be choosing an alternative hotel next year (one that is really a 5*).Yours, an unhappy customer.** Final point - It appears \"penny-pinching\" by charging 2 euros for coffee in the rooms - I've never stayed in any other 5* hotel were they charge!

The owner was Dutch and very happy to help us in any way.We requested a bottle of wine to sit in the communal area in the evening once back from our evening out and he was happy to help.Also gave great info on where to eat and go.I have seen some reviews say its out of the way but for me the location was perfect. Only a 15 minute walk into town and 20 at the most walking back as its slightly uphill.Lovely continental buffet style breakfast and the room we stayed in had a lovely view of one of the castles, nice bathroom and a comfy bed. Also had cable TV. What more could you ask for?All in all a great little place to stay.",Aug,2015,Aug 2015,2015-08-01,2015,5
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,originalcraig,39,originalcraigwrote a review Jun 2022,"Stayed for a week in a one bed apartment in block K for half term weekOn arrival no real warm welcome or complimentary drink. Had to drag our cases 300 metres up a cobbled pavement to find our room. Upon entering our room we were a little upset at the condition of the room and there was no bed for our child. Went back to reception and enquired about upgrading and was advised it wasnâ€™t possible but to check again the following day. They did that evening make up a bed in the living room. Not really the smooth experience youâ€™d expect and not appreciated when arriving at 10pmRoom was spacious although the double bed was very small. The air con worked well. It seemed clean enough, rooms were superficially made up every other day although bedsheets and towels werenâ€™t changed. The bathroom was in a poor condition and didnâ€™t seem to be cleaned during the whole stay.Plenty of mildew/damp in the bathroom, rusty shower curtain to compliment the rusty old dilapidated parasol on the balcony/terraceRoom was by the small (slightly neglected) play area and the hotel grounds were nicely maintained expect for the fag ends on the path leading to our terraceOverall the room was very basic and in need of an overhaul - certainly nowhere near worth the advertised rate of 200 Euro per night which is probably the worst value of any hotel Iâ€™ve ever stayed inUpon asking for a late checkout we were advised half price until 3pm (100 Euro) and the full price of 200 Euro after that. In fairness the hotel did offer use of the shower rooms under the swimming pool and provided clean towels for us to useNo luxury touches, just a soap dispenser in the bathroom and had to pay an additional charge to use the safe and hire beach towelsThere are 2 main pools. 1 has lots of missing tiles and as a result of this a lovely Irish family we met had an accident where their young boy cut his leg needing 7 stitches upon climbing out of the pool. The other main pool was better maintained but a bit rowdy due to large groups of lads with vocabulary seemingly limited to swearingWe upgraded to breakfast prior to arrival. There were cereals, pastries, fresh fruit and yoghurts which were fine and perfectly acceptable. The fruit juices were not drinkable. The cooked breakfast was below average with strips of reformed meat instead of proper bacon. In fairness I did enjoy eating the fried bread, something Iâ€™ve not eaten in many, many years (I hope my doctor doesnâ€™t read this!) but obviously a very cheap way to pad out the cooked mealsDidnâ€™t use any other facilities expect the gym in the sister hotel which was laughable, the weights didnâ€™t fit the barbells and the machines had stretchy cables so as you extend a rep the weights are starting to lower themselves back down!The trump card of the hotel is the location with direct access to the beach and touching distance of the strip and restaurants etc (just as well really as it made it easy to get away from the place)The hotel has a nice reception area which gives a great first impression but overall seems underinvested which is a huge shame as the potential is absolutely huge for this hotel. I imagine when it first opened it would have been top classIf you had an upgraded room, used the main pool early and left before the rowdy crowd youâ€™d probably think itâ€™s a nice hotel but sadly our experience didnâ€™t reflect thatIâ€™d come back to Portugal 100% and this was my 5th visit to The Algarve (3rd to Albuferia area so knew what to expect) but sadly for the time being Iâ€™d give this hotel a wide berth",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,2
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Leanna,25,Leannawrote a review Jul 2015,"Have been to this hotel before, but we were not overly impressed this time round.The work that is being carried out at the hotel, is major work.  A promenade is being built and although it is not always noisy,  the hotel has lost a lot of the grassed area it used to have.  So the beds are all crammed together and there is a fence round the hotel.  Not nice views to have.Bar staff not overly attentive either.  We sat 15mins one night waiting to be served, and the hotel was not busy, we ended up just heading to bed.Lunch was ok, Toasties are made with olive oil and come drenched.  Other food is ok, but a but pricey.  I prefer to eat in the room, or locally for a lot less money.Breakfast is nice, but service outside can be slow, you have to constantly ask for tea and coffee. It didn't really bother me too much though.Staff are pleasant enough and hotel is kept very clean.Location is good - 5/10mins to Vilamoura marina.  Lovely Marina, but you will pay more for meals, head back to the shops and restaurants set back from here and you will find some lovely little places to eat and drink.Kids area is really nice and kept clean, however, a little more variety of games etc would be good.I would rate this hotel 4 star.  In my opinion, it has several improvements before it can be classed as a 5 star hotel.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,4

Our room was deluxe 1 bed room, the couch in the living room was stained and dirty. It is true also that the bathroom smells like seawage so not so comfotable. Location its very close to the very beautiful beach so dont spend too much in your room. Food not so great. The many â€œrestaurantsâ€ that you can dine in i feel like its a scam as all food seem to be cooked in one kitchen. Overall ok place to stay.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Clive H,117,Clive Hwrote a review Sep 2020,"Recently returned to this hotel after 2 years so obviously very different experience due to Covid.I find it unbelievable some of the negative comments on here , people really need to get a life .This hotel is spotlessly clean throughout, everything has been very much moved out on to the terraces utilising the lovely space outside and to assist social distancing.Breakfast is plentiful and well organised and in my experience  with very or little queuing, food and drink at lunch and at the pool bar excellent.The pool is magnificent one of the best I have seen at least 80 meters in length, ignorant early morning risers who pinch sun-beds all day and are never on them are not tolerated if this is you then don’t come here you will be found out  , it is rubbish to say you cannot leave you bed for a short period of time , if you speak to the towel kiosk let them know you are going for lunch it’s not an issue the sunbed  policy works a treat.Overall great hotel doing a superb job in this pandemic  ,fantastic location right on the beach , with the superb resort of vilamoura a 5 minute stroll from the marina.100% would recommend this hotel don’t let some of the negative comments put you off going , the world is struggling with a pandemic this hotel and its staff are doing a great job to ensure anybody staying here has a safe and relaxed time .",Sep,2020,Sep 2020,2020-09-01,2020,5
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Vian S,19,Vian Swrote a review Apr 2017,we were advised to choose vila Gale Tavira by a friend who lives in Tavira .This is because of its location.It is very central with walking distance to local restaurants around the romantic and military bridges. The staff at the reception were not that helpful. We got an invitation in our room for a complementary  drink at the reception on Saturday 1st of April but when we went there and asked for a glass of water it was declined !! and the waitress said that this is only for the guest who has just arrived.Breakfast was very good but the buffet dinner was not value for money. It cost us 23 euros each .you can have a fabulous meal at mama MIA pizzeria just around the corner  for a fraction of that . However our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. but noisy as it was facing the main road.Also if you want to use the safe you have to pay extra money .,Apr,2017,Apr 2017,2017-04-01,2017,2

Hotel Albergaria Dias,TheBaddowDaniels,13,TheBaddowDanielswrote a review May 2015,"What can we say, this little gem of a hotel gets better every time we visit (if that's even possible).  Just returned from our third stay at the Albergaria Dias Hotel and the team remain as delightful as ever.A small, quiet hotel, ideal for couples or friends looking for a tranquil little retreat, it is perfectly situated in the old town of Funchal, literally minutes walk from a selection of excellent restaurants and the city centre.Mr Dias and his son, Joao, continue to run this hotel to a superb standard and we would like to say special thank you's to Cecilia, Sophia, Luisa and Carla for all ensuring our stay went without a hitch.I should also make a mention of the catering staff (wonderful buffet breakfasts every morning, with Mr Dias's legendary fresh fruit salad!) and great snacks and lunches at the pool bar.  And the cleaning staff are brilliant.  The hotel is spotless and yet you never seem to notice them in action.  What an amazing team the hotel is.Thank you again - and we look forward to returning again.  We would not look to stay anywhere else in Funchal.P.S. Visited the Fort Restaurant for the first time this visit, and it's well worth it - a brilliant night and fantastic food - well worth the money..  Xarambina also continues to be our favourite little restaurant retreat, with their Steak or Tuna on a stone being just as good as we remember.",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,5

The free breakfast is amazing - they make banana pancakes every single morning. There is plenty of fruits and overnight oats. They have daily family dinners which is helpful to meet other travellers. There is a bar with cheap drinks and that is another way to meet people. The location is a bit of a walk from the beach and old town but I actually loved the walk. It was good exercise and very peaceful. The hostel recommended so many different activities and things to do. They also had activities going on everyday like yoga at night, yoga on the beach, day trips, etc.  The staff and volunteers were so helpful. 11/10 I would go back here in a heartbeat!",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,2

However the front desk staff leave a lot to be desired.   Very rude. Especially to Americans.   We had an early morning flight so I checked out the night before as advised by the front desk staff.  When electing at 5 am the next morning the night crew yelled for us to come back and check out.  I informed him I did so the night before.  He abruptly told me thst and didnâ€™t and called someone to confirm.  He discovered that yes I did check out.  He did not apologize nor thank us for our stay.  Just walked back into the hotel.

Our friends took us here, We honestly did not know what to expect and really did not do much research before hand. So when we pulled up we were pleasantly surprised. This place is beautiful. On the drive in I knew we would love everything about this hotel. Every room is decorated beautifully from the lobby, the bar, the restaurant etc. We stayed in a 3 bedroom cottage. It had fully equipped kitchen and a very comfortable living room. Each bedroom upstairs had its own bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and at night it was so quiet you could here a pin drop. The grounds here are amazing and I wish we had been here when the pool was open. I could see myself enjoying long days by there. The restaurant served excellent meals, it did not disappoint and we chose to have dinner both nights there as it was so good. The staff was amazing  and always ready to help you in anyway. They also have great wine which we drank a lot of!!! This truly is a special place in the country and would recommend it to anyone who just want to unwind for a bit.

Really good location opposite the metro (red line takes you direct to and from airport. Access to blue line into the centre of Lisbon is a short walk away.)The  rate for b & b is extremely good for a capital city hotel. The only reason for not giving 5 stars was there is building work next door at the moment and I had not been made aware of this as I had booked quite a while ago.

The breakfast was also very good. On this occasion, I have noticed that the levels of service have dropped off. In particular the breakfast service is really rather poor. On the first day it took 45 minutes to get a cappuccino and a total of 3 requests before it arrived, and on the second day it took 40 minutes to get the Eggs Benedict from the a la carte menu, which I wasn’t initially offered at all on the first day, and when they arrived they were stone cold. It’s a shame as this has the potential to be a great hotel, as it was when I first came, but next time I think I may look elsewhere as the price is high but the value has declined.",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,2

Legendary Lisboa Suites,D&D_Holiday_feedback,210,D&D_Holiday_feedbackwrote a review May 2011,"We arrived on Friday 29th at around 10am.  We expected to just drop our bags, as check in wasn't until 2pm, but, once they had found our reservation (BA had put it through on my first name, not surname), we were allowed in to our room to freshen up. We had booked a studio and had been put on the 7th floor, which had a balcony which was really nice.  The room had a small kitchen with table, facilities were basic, a two ring hob, one sauce pan, a chopping board and 2 plates, 2 bowls, 2 glasses, 2 of all the basics really. You couldn't make a full meal in this kitchenette, but it was sufficient to boil an egg for breakfast. The room otherwise was spacious and clean.  One grumble would be the bathroom supplies, they provided handwash and showergel / shampoo from wall mounted units, which felt cheap and handwash isn't really soap and shower gel isn't great in your hair.   I'm not sure why they had taken this approach (maybe green creditials?) as alongside this they had a range of other accesories including a shoe horn, nail file and comb which I'd swap anyday for a bar of soap and a proper seperate shampoo.The location of the hotel was good, being walking distance to where the tourist buses go from and a metro.  It was also only a 20 min walk to the old town and across to the main area for resturants - Bairro Alto - you may want to get a taxi back up the hill however on the way home!There is a supermarket just across the main road at the bottom of the hotel hill - had a good range and great fresh bread. There isn't really anywhere around the hotel to get a drink (and the hotel has no bar), so grab a bottle of something at the supermarket if you like a late night drink.  For breakfast / snacks there are a couple of snack bars / pastry shops in short walking distance and McDonalds opposite the hotel. The hotel does offer breakfast, but we didn't try this.Reception were helpful (although I think the same man was working there all the time as he seemed to be there when we got up and when we got home at night) and were able to point us in the right direction.In terms of Lisbon as a city to visit, its great for walking round and exploring.  One thing we would really recommend is going over to see Cristo Rei, its a replica of the Christ the Redeemer monument in Rio and gives great views over the city and is really quiet compared to the other tourist spots (there were only 6 of us up the monument when we went).  There is apparently a ferry over (but i'd imagine a big climb up from the sea), but we got a taxi over.  It takes about 20mins each way - make sure you arrange for  the driver to wait for you, as there aren't taxis waiting around to take you back!Overall, nice clean modern hotel in a good location.",May,2011,May 2011,2011-05-01,2011,4

The room and bathroom were very large and we had a nice balcony that looked up the hill at the Convento de Cristo. As there was a heat wave in Portugal while we were in Tomar (97 degrees that day) this was the only room that we were comfortable in overnight. It has air conditioning and you are able to crank it down to 16 degrees celsius.There is a very large parking lot out front, so it shouldn't be a problem if you drive. My only complaint is that we were not advised by the hotel (even after we emailed them for a confirmation) that there was a festival in Tomar that night that closed every street to the hotel nor that they had a very large convention that same day. We spent nearly an hour driving around Tomar trying to find a street that was not blocked off that would get us to the hotel. We eventually left town and came back in to go around the other side.
