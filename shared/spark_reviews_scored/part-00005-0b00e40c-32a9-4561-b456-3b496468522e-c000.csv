Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,AliMurph2024,0,AliMurph2024wrote a review Jun 2024,"We had a brilliant week here with two children (7 & 4)The hotel in general was immaculately clean. There were staff constantly cleaning and maintaining all the areas. The pool is cleaned daily and the whole pool area is power washed.Our room was spacious and clean with good working air conditioning. A bonus was finding a drying rack on the balcony!The pools were fantastic - clean and interesting with steps and slopes, splash parks, a thrilling waterpark which both children could enjoy and a quiet pool. The water was chilly early in the week but you acclimatise quickly. Later in the week though with glorious weather the water was actually warm and very comfortable. The water park was a huge hit and there really weren’t any queues which meant we went on the slides on repeat!The food was fantastic! I’m not sure why I see reviews saying there isn’t much choice - there is such a huge range of food which is beautifully presented and caters for all palates. My 7 year old had the time of his life sampling so many fresh foods and specials. There are great themes as well eg Indian night, Latina night, Americana etc. My picky 4 year old found loads to cater to his needs and obviously stocked up on ice creamThe staff are polite and helpful and there are no long waits at bars or in the buffet. The housekeeping staff are friendly and did a great job keeping our room clean through the week with new bedding and towels. Reception were very helpful and even organised a breakfast bag for our early departure.The shuttle to the beach was really handy and gave us a nice break from the hotel - the beach and old town were fantastic.My children went to the kids club and had a great time (they aren’t easily pleased!) - the days were themed and tied in with the mini disco in the evening. Very neat!All in all a wonderful trip and a brilliant stay at Jupiter - cannot recommend enough - thank you to all staff 🩷",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4

Montebelo Viseu Congress Hotel & Spa,Mariline B,0,Mariline Bwrote a review Aug 2025,"The stay was quite pleasant, room could be a little more spacious, strong point in the cleanliness and sympathy of the staff. Breakfast very nice and in the right amount. Very good spa, to improve the jacuzzi integrated in the indoor pool, as it should be stronger to feel and have relaxing effect. The ice bath in the relaxation circuit was spectacular but on the 2nd and 3rd days it was broken. I'd stay back.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,3

Quinta Mirabela,nckweeks,99,nckweekswrote a review Nov 2023,"We arrived on Saturday evening and decided to go out to find something to eat. We found that everything was in town, which is a 40 to 50 minute walk down the steep hill. We had a wander around  near the hotel and found a local pub open and ate there. The hotel is located on a very steep hill, and getting back was quite a hike.On Sunday, we decided to walk into town and found that most of it was shut. We decided to eat our evening meal at the hotel. The food was good but the restaurant had very little atmosphere. We didn't like the quietness with people whispering and the gentle noise of cutlery on crockery. We didn't eat there again in the evening.The breakfast maybe was more suited to German tastes. Many other guests were German.We had a good look around and the hotel has some lovely areas and facilities. The views over Funchal were superb. Maybe it's good if you just want to stay in the hotel.We hired a car because we really needed to, to get anywhere. A local yellow taxi had charged us €15 for a five minute journey. The hotel car park was close and free to use. The roads up to and around the hotel were quite challenging. There were lots of one-way systems, and we got lost even with a sat nav. The road system at the bottom of the hill was particularly confusing. It's not directly to do with the hotel, but having to endure and cope with that was part of the experience of staying in the area.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the room maid did excellent work every day.In hindsight, we should have booked closer to the town or in a quieter area with user-friendly roads. The hotel was good, but the location ruined the experience for us.",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,2
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Gaz,7,Gazwrote a review Jun 2024,"A crowded but clean experience, with an average to sometimes poor Buffett selection, and lifts that will have you waiting 20 minutes to reach the ground floor at prime times.Our stay with The Jupiter was mostly event free with the one exception being the wait for an empty lift around prime times. This was exasperated by being on the 7th floor.The hotel offers a relatively small amount of entertainment for children. Including a small climbing frame and slide, soft play, and shallow swimming pool with water slides.Disappointingly for the duration of our stay the children’s buffet selection did not extend beyond chicken nuggets and spaghetti bolognaise, but this was balanced with fruit, veg and salad from the adult buffet area.Staff were always polite, attentive and helpful. WiFi good throughout.Location was central but required taxi (Uber is great here) or use of shuttle bus to get in and out of new and old town with families as paths can be tricky to walk.Our room was pool facing and so could hear the noise from the night time entertainment even from the 7th floor on the far side. I suspect closer rooms may have a more negative experience. However if you’re going to bed later this may not be an issue, bed time for our 2 kids was around 9pm.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Rosie E,105,Rosie Ewrote a review Aug 2019,"We booked the Belmar for an impromptu trip to the Lagos area. Having stayed around Porto do Mos before we are familiar with the area. The hotel looks very nice. Parking on site for cars. Friendly staff at reception. We had a 60m square modern apartment within the hotel complex. Sea view too. It was well equipped and generally clean. Just the bathroom needed some attention ( 2 light bulbs needed replaced and the plug in the basin did not work).We didn’t fuss about it as we were there for such a short time. The kitchen was excellent with dishwasher and Washing machine ( bring your own tablets for these, cheaper). There was a coffee machine too. Again buy or bring your own coffee pods for this. Air conditioning worked well for us. The towel issue (as discussed by other trip advisors) was very irritating and disappointing for what is a classy establishment. The towels generally are small and thin ( worn out). No towels supplied for bidet use. No face flannels either. Our bathroom towels were replaced as needed ( daily). The spa towels varied in size and quality. The “ticket “ system is not unusual in Europe and North America. But really unnecessary! I would bring my own beach towel if visiting again ( there is a good washing machine in the room. “Toiletries supplied “amounted to wall mounted hand gel / shower gel only. The digital safe has been “modified “to take an actual key (another other thing to worry about losing!). We didn’t use the restaurant or bar as we like to self cater or eat in the abundant restaurants in and around Lagos. The queues at peak breakfast times confirmed we’d made the right decision. The lobby bar looked rather dreary. Nice little drinks kiosk at the outdoor poolside. Rent a car or use taxis to get around. I would come back if the hotel updated it’s towels etc.",Aug,2019,Aug 2019,2019-08-01,2019,4

Convento da Provença,fortyfran,37,fortyfranwrote a review Oct 2014,"This is a quiet and peaceful hotel in the countryside just out of Portalegra. The manageress Lucia was excellent.  She spoke excellent English, was very friendly gave good advise regarding  places to visit, restaurants etc.  The Hotel is decorated with historical artifacts and Lucia gave a guide to the building and explanations regarding the artifacts.  Breakfast was very good and served with a smile by the staff.In the morning the local farmer brought his goats to feed on the grass nearby and the sound of bells was very enjoyable.I would definitely stay there again.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Suzanne G,11,Suzanne Gwrote a review Jun 2022,"We arrived for our 11 night stay here (and my mother in law stayed for a week) and we were all very happy with our hotel. The reception area was beautiful, with friendly staff always available - nothing was too much trouble, including making a cake and providing complimentary fizz for my husbands 40th birthday!Special thanks goes to Ali, the restaurant and bar manager, who looked after my dietary needs as I’m coeliac. He always made sure I knew exactly what I could eat at the buffet and went over and above to ensure I didn’t become unwell (I didn’t!) He always made me feel safe and comfortable to eat the food provided.The rooms were clean, spacious and having our own washing machine was a bonus, particularly with having a three year old! We had a ground floor room but had no issues with noise whatsoever.The local amenities are all within walking distance and you can easily catch a taxi or tuc tuc to get around. My husband enjoyed using the gym and sauna, and my daughter loved the kids pools.I would 100% recommend this hotel",Jun,2022,Jun 2022,2022-06-01,2022,5
"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",Traveleff,3,Traveleffwrote a review Mar 2022,"The resort itself is very picturesque, the views from the cliff are amazing. We stayed in top floor 1 bed suite, most of the rooms have partial sea view not from the room itself but from the balcony. Fully furnished kitchen is definitely a huge plus as well as a huge bathroom which is cleverly integrated into the bedroom. The spa which is located in the same building is great as well when it's not packed. So overall the resort lives up to expectations, the only downside is that they start mowing their lawns at about 7:30am 2-3 times a week and if you like sleeping in while on holidays this may become an issue as their mowers are extremely loud.",Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,4
1908 Lisboa Hotel,Mandy W,2,Mandy Wwrote a review Jul 2017,We stayed for 5 nights and were impressed with the hotel.  The staff were very efficient and welcoming throughout our stay.  When we arrived our room was upgraded to one overlooking the square which was lovely.  The room was tastefully decorated and really quiet.  The breakfast was great and the restaurant was always popular in the evenings.  The area around the hotel appears to be being developed and an area of Lisbon which is obviously growing in popularity.  The hotel is located near to many of the main visitor attractions and transport links.  Would definitely recommend.,Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,4
Lisbon Destination Hostel,FayeLana,48,FayeLanawrote a review Aug 2016,"I've been returning to Lisbon Destination hostel again and again since it opened. It really is fantastic and I wouldn't choose to stay anywhere else in Lisbon.First of all the location is wonderful - in the very heart of Lisbon and with vibrant places to visit on its doorstep. The hostel itself is beautiful - the communal area is an indoor garden with hammocks and beanbags - a great place to socialise and relax. The hostel itself is so good that it would be very easy to stay inside all day without even venturing into Lisbon! I stayed in a private double ensuite decorated beautifully.The staff could not be warmer and friendlier - a real asset of the hostel. They organise activities every day - a great way to experience the very best of the city and make new friends if you're travelling alone.In the morning a great free breakfast is served - coffee machine, pancakes, fresh bread, fresh pineapple and watermelon and hams, cheese and jam. In the evenings an award winning chef cooks dinner, served with carafes of wine.I made lots of friends here and cannot rate this place highly enough. I'll definitely be returning, but it's no surprise that it becomes booked-up quickly so it's worth planning in advance!THANK YOU to all the wonderful staff who really made my stay so memorable and enjoyable!",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,5
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,Poisson rouge,23,Poisson rougewrote a review Jun 2024,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel in mid-June 2024. (Room 405, ground floor with sea view).The 4 star rating should be weighted to fall between \"average\" and \"very good\".The positive points...Beautiful hotel, beautiful view, well-kept gardens, friendly and helpful staff, good bedding.The negative points :1- Noisy, insulation could be improved, examples: we cannot escape the neighbors' conversations, nor the noise of running water when they take a shower!2- If the dining room is suitable for breakfasts (very generous), it is not suitable for dinners (solution: go to the terrace if the weather permits).3-Maintenance of rooms:cracked shower screen, missing shower tile joints, damaged wooden furniture, rusty bay window sliders...Can do better !4- Parking: little space to park nearby so arrive before 6 p.m. and don't forget to fold down the mirrors of the rental car....this can be useful...",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,4
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,mikaelbos,15,mikaelboswrote a review Dec 2013,"We stayed in Estalagem da Ponta do Sol for a week before Christmas in 2013. It was the low season and we had a pretty quiet stay (which was nice). We traveled as a couple and that's what the hotel suits best for. It had a few bars, which were definitely not crowded so the service was fast. In short it's a nice hotel with friendly staff, modern style and awfully slow internet connection which shouldn't be marketed.Arrival and free ticketsUpon arrival we were given free drink tickets that were valid for first and second night. We missed the dates but checked the bar later. We also got discounts for the spa treatments but ended up not using them. They were a nice addition, too.Great food, low on optionsThe breakfast was good with bacon, eggs, breads, lots of different fresh fruits (not canned fruits), cakes, cereal, muesli, juices and coffee. The classy restaurant has beautiful views from it's high windows down to the town of Ponta do Sol, a beach and sea below. The meal and dinner tasted great, but the menu wasn't very long and it didn't change. It's great for a short stay but not for a week or more unless you want to try new food every time. For this reason we didn't eat there every day. Oh, and even though I like serving things in a new way, I do wish the hamburger had bread!Hotel and beautiful surroundingsThe place where the hotel stands is beautiful. The hotel sits on top of a high cape and has views to three directions with a lot of sea around and the valley with the town. You ride a tallish elevator to reach the reception in more traditional building, the restaurant and bar are also nearby. Then you take a short elevator ride for the top where the accommodation buildings, pool area, saunas and another bar sits in - the second bar was closed during our stay. The hotel in general is stylish and modern, while not being sterile. The lower bar for example has a very warm atmosphere with fireplaces inside and on the terrace. The latter ran out of fire while we were enjoying our drinks and it got cold quite soon.Pool and saunaThe infinity pool shown in pictures was nice, though the water in December wasn't too hot but still enjoyable. Then again, if it was too cold there was a heated indoor pool with funky lights changing colour from light blue to pornish red. There was also a traditional sauna which was great. Some instructions on how to use might have been on place. We were said it would be always on upon request and when we later asked about that at 8 pm clothed in bathrobes it was said it's turning off at 8 pm. Duh. When we finally go there there was twice some hassle when other people were about to use it too. No big deal though, I'm glad they had one, it's the most relaxing thing ever!Friendly staffThe staff was friendly and room make-ups we're quite in-depth. One day we went on an early hike for the mountains and asked for an early breakfast - it was no problem for the hotel. There was two dogs free inside the hotel. I love dogs, but the other cutie seemed to have bad hair and it scratched itself often. I noticed it enjoyed the evenings on the sofa at the bar close to the warm fireplace. I figured I better stay on the chairs just to be safe.Stylish room with sucky internetOur room 306 was okay. It was marketed as sea view room and with a wi-fi in it. The room faced northwest to the direction of the town and partly the sea and it was on the second/third (top) floor (depending how you count floors in your country!). The room was high with a bathtub in the bath room. Unfortunately high ceiling meant that it warmed up quite slowly so you had to put the A/C-heater on whenever you were in. For the electronics (outlets, A/C) to be on a card (any card would do just fine) was required to be in a slot next to the door. So it was a bit chilly, but the blankets were great!The sea view was actually a 1/4 sea view with most of the view being down to the town. I liked to watch the streets, building and hills, but my girlfriend found the sea to be more comforting and wish it would have played a larger role. Our room was not in the west (sea facing) corner of the building, but close to it.Biggest annoyance was the wi-fi or wlan the room was supposed to have. I was supposed to answer some e-mails during my visit but it was proven harder than expected. I had a few devices with me and each failed to connect the network several times and when they did the speed was unbearably slow. I had to refresh pages many times and wait easily ten minutes to see if a page loaded or not. This is the only thing I mentioned to the hotel staff and they advised to try it on the balcony. The signal strength was good but still the internet was slower than anything. I actually tried to take a photo of an internet speed test site for this review, but I never got the test site open! How bad is that? Try to check your mail on that then. While it forced me to fix on the relaxing part of the holiday, it drove me nuts as there was still some things I was expected to do during my stay and I was unable to do them. Also I relied too much on checking maps etc in the room from the internet - obviously it was a hard task with the offered connection. Thankfully I had offline maps in my phone and we navigated our rented car with those.We had a \"two person room\" so I can't say much about the beds. I wished we had a double bed but it was a twin bed with beds moved next to each other. So there was a crack between the beds and the mattresses tended to slide if you tried to balance between the mattresses. We didn't say about this so the issue might have been fixed should we have mentioned it.The fridge in the room was great, it allowed us to stock it up with goodies. We have never really needed an actual minibar with all the expensive snacks. I understood it would have been delivered if needed, but I definitely liked the (minibar sized) empty fridge to put our own stuff in.The rooms weren't really that well sound isolated. The waves hitting rocks down the beach were calming, but the Germans partying downstairs were not. Neither were the tv-sounds from the next room, the fellow quests walking down the outdoor corridor while chatting, the early new year crackers from the town exploding loudly occasionally and the Christmas parties from the town beach.Overall the hotel was great, the staff was great and the atmosphere was relaxing. The minor annoyances didn't slow down from reaching the holiday feeling except for the wi-fi which drove me nuts when waiting to open the pages.I hope you found this helpful!",Dec,2013,Dec 2013,2013-12-01,2013,3

The staff was amazingly friendly, professional, and attentive.  The rooms were very attractive and comfortable and the location on the Avenue de Liberdad was great.

SANA Capitol Hotel,alancgreen8,238,alancgreen8wrote a review Dec 2019,"Clean and comfortable perhaps in need of a little TLC but convenient for central Lisbon and nearby car parks. We used Holmes Place which cost 55 euros for two days. Our room was small but adequate only lacking in coffee/tea making facilities.Breakfast was impressive in terms of variety and quality but could have been so much better if the hot elements were hot, or even luke warm. Cold fried eggs or cold scrambled isn’t nice. We did not see any of the hot trays replaced or for that matter the coffee urns, meaning that the coffee was stewed and barely warm.That said we enjoyed our stay and will use this hotel again.",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,4

Casa Mitchell Apartments,MamaHevs,108,MamaHevswrote a review Jul 2012,"We were set down from the coach at the end of the road as the road is too small to get the coach down. However, it is only a few yards to the apartments which are situated on both sides of the road - reception, dining room/bar, B&B on one side and the apartments on the other side. We were horribly delayed but the owner had waited for us to arrive.A lovely large clean room. We did have a problem with the toilet overflowing which was quickly sorted out. The apartments are set around the small poll which has some loungers. It was very quiet. I am not sure whether this was due to the fact if you spoke everyone could hear you or at age 50 we were the youngest.It was deserted around the outside of the hotel, there are some commercial buildings and waste land depending on which way you go into the town and we had been warned to be vigilant but we never saw a soul.Approx 3 minutes to the see front promenade and 5 to the edge of the bars. It is hilly but we did not find that a problem.Great value for the price",Jul,2012,Jul 2012,2012-07-01,2012,4

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",Warren G,2,Warren Gwrote a review Aug 2018,"This is our second visit to the Reids Palace and we are in our final week here. On looking at the negative reviews we have to totally disagree. My husband and I are in our 40's and our son has just turned 11. There is so much for our son to do and loads of children his age and slightly older. Is he bored?  Definitely not.. Are the other children here bored? I do not think so. From diving into the sea, to their own computer room, billiards room, events just for children there is so much for them to do. Are we surrounded by elderly people? Unless you are classing 40+ year olds as elderly then maybe so. I truly believe it is down to the time of the year you visit the hotel. If you want younger people, come during the summer and school holidays. If you want quiet and an older generation come out of season. Once you have been to this hotel you will be spoilt for future hotels. The joy of not having to fight for Sun beds in the morning is worth every penny. The service, the way you are made to feel special is what this hotel is all about. You cannot fault it in anyway. Yes it is expensive but before you go you know this due to the price of the holiday so why complain. The Williams restaurant, perfect.. I would definitely recommend, by far the nicest meal we have ever had. We just had their normal menu but the way it was served and presented,in the words of our son. WOW. They even offered to prepare a dish for our son if there was nothing on the menu he wanted. I am writing this review whilst sitting watc hing the sun set in the grounds of this beautiful hotel filled with so much history. I hope it does not change as to us it is perfect just the way it  is.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,4

PortoBay Liberdade,itsmattn,9,itsmattnwrote a review Oct 2023,"The room we were allocated is not the smallest, but it was still of a restricted size - to the point where 2 open suitcases could not fit. At night, the room is dark, even with all the lamps on. The decor is dated. The bathroom is bad - the shower drain is blocked, causing water to accumulate, in addition to leaking water into the rest of the bathroom (which is completely open to the bedroom). The stall, where the toilet is located, did not have a lock because it was damaged. Good breakfast - only the quality of the coffee beans leaves something to be desired. The service is good, but nothing exceptional.The hotel's facilities and service do not match the 5-star rating - they are far below.

Everything about it, from the superb location overlooking Funchal Bay, to the exquisite and plentiful public rooms, the sumptuous bedrooms, the top-of-the-line service and the excellent food oozes class and style. It may be expensive, but it's worth it. I was tempted to deduct points for the late announcement that there were going to be renovations during our stay, involving closing two of the restaurants, the inconvenience of losing our beautiful Garden Room for breaksfast and the (slight) noise round the pool area - but that would be carping and petty. This is a magnificent hotel offering a magnificent experience.",Feb,2017,Feb 2017,2017-02-01,2017,5

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Diane M,5,Diane Mwrote a review Sep 2014,"After reading some very negative views I was somewhat wary of staying here. I have no clue what the moaners were on about! Honestly it was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. Spotlessly clean and lovely rooms.I always take a travel kettle so no problem with having a cuppa in the room.We were given a free upgrade and had a lovely view on the marina side. No noise from the casino at all.To the people moaning about only 1 chair on the balcony move the inside one outside! Problem solved! Delicious breakfast with fresh fruit,cereals,breads and cooked items.No complaints there. Minutes from the marina and beach. As for poolside sun beds, as we are not ones to sit all day at the pool this wasn't a problem for us but we went down early one morning and got 2 beds no bother and the other times we went later in the day again beds available.This has to be one of the best hotels in Vilamoura for the price we paid. We will return.Oh and the staff were very nice also. Smile and be pleasant with them and they will respond accordingly.Would love to return.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,2

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Sarah P,1,Sarah Pwrote a review Mar 2023,"Definitely not a 4 star hotel, we had booked deluxe room and it was incredibly small, facilities in the room were minimal and if you decided to self cater you would struggle. Bedroom itself was tiny there was little to no room between the bed and the wall and the door to room barely opened because of the size of the room. On our first night we complained about a hole in the bath tub the had brown stuff coming from it  and were told maintenance would be around to fix first thing next morning but never showed when we complain later that evening we were told we'd be given a new room and to come back an hour later but when we returned staff at reception had changed and the new staff had no knowledge of us being moved to a new room and had to scramble to accommodate us. The new room was a little bigger and the only reason why I gave 3 stars. If you have mobility issues I wouldn't recommend this hotel as its on a really steep hill and alot of stairs to get to 90% of the rooms",Mar,2023,Mar 2023,2023-03-01,2023,3

The room was spectacular, with a front view to the sea that provided us with unforgettable afternoon ends, with a stunning sunset.We had the opportunity to try the buffet and we were very satisfied. The variety and quality of the food exceeded expectations, and the service was worthy of a hotel with more than 4 stars.We thank you for all the hospitality and will definitely be back one day!",Feb,2025,Feb 2025,2025-02-01,2025,4
Ocean Gardens,SandraAWestMidlands,24,SandraAWestMidlandswrote a review Nov 2017,"I have no complaints about this hotel whatsoever BUT I just want to warn people who do not stay there via a travel agent.  We arranged for a private transfer to and from the airport to the hotel so was surprised when the driver handed us an envelope from our 'Rep' who was meeting us a couple of hours later at the hotel.  In the envelope was just a few brochures.  We duly met with the person as advised but only now on reflection do I believe it's a bit of a scam as we foolishly booked a couple of trips with them.  PLEASE do not do this should you have the same situation before you have checked out the other offerings from the other agencies in Funchal as I believe we paid far far more than we would have if we'd have booked elsewhere and then to add insult to injury the first trip the driver turned up 30 minutes late and then the second tour they forgot us altogether and had to come back for us after starting the trip!  I simply believe details are passed on to individuals when they establish you haven't booked through a tour company, so want to make others aware.  AND there is now a little bar/restaurant called Boa Vista just a short walk down from the hotel which has just been done up by a Portuguese chap who has returned having run a restaurant in Jersey for years.  We had a few drinks there and it's a lovely clean and friendly and very reasonably priced!!",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,1

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Kevin H,16,Kevin Hwrote a review Feb 2022,"Late deal booked for some early sunshine over half termIâ€™ll start with the good points;We had an excellent, spacious, and well equipped room with view over the pool as well as a sea view.The Ocean bar was well ran, with friendly staff and entertainment was provided by Mauro who did his best to keep people amused.Now the bad points;Due to a local festival the hotel had accepted multiple coach parties which led to ridiculously long queues at meal times (one access in and out). This was worsened by the barricading off around the pool area in an attempt to provide Al fresco dining.The hotel has pretensions to be all inclusive - this it most certainly isnâ€™t, at best it could deliver half board.The pool bar was in the main restaurant and was only available from 1200, so if you wanted a soft drink of anything prior it came out of your own pocket.The food was repetitive and bland, and itâ€™s a pretty sad state of affairs when the hottest food they can serve is salad or yogurt..!If you want cheap and cheerful there is better value for money to be had in Albufeira.This was very much the same sentiment being echoed by other guests we spoke too.Needless to say we wonâ€™t be returningâ€¦.",Feb,2022,Feb 2022,2022-02-01,2022,2

The hotel is clean and staff very helpful and attentive.  The pool area is fantastic and never really got busy so felt it was almost your own private pool and again amazing views.  Folklore night every Friday 25 euros is well worth the money and very entertaining.  The hotel provides a courtesy bus every day apart from Sundays at 10 and 3 down into town (10 min ride) or 1 and 5pm pick up from town.  The local yellow bus is frequent enough and cost 1.80 euros, you can get daily tickets etc. from the hotel.  One thing to remember if getting the bus, the stop is right outside the hotel driveway entrance.  This is on a very steep bend in the road so please stand behind the hotel wall and not at the bus stop.  The reason for this is on our first bus trip out a car took the bend far too fast and careered towards us standing at the bus stop.  Fortunately we jumped out of it's way and the car and us remained undamaged but did shake us up.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

I booked this hotel after careful consideration through Travel Republic, with my debit card. The next day I got an e-mail from the hotel saying my CREDIT card had been rejected and could I contact them to provide details of another card. Numerous attempts to do this via e-mail (copied to Travel Republic) and phone calls to the hotel's answering machine proved unsuccessful so I decided not to make the trip to Lisbon, without a confirmed hotel booking. On return to UK, I found that there was in fact no problem with any of my cards but that my debit card had in fact been debited to the price of £58. Since then, I have been trying to get an explanation - and refund for a hotel room I never had. I have simply been ignored.  I have now had to accept I've been charged £58 for a room I never had.
