Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Sukh Pabial,0,Sukh Pabialwrote a review Apr 2022,"Excellent resort. Stayed with my 3 kids in a 3-bed apartment. The apartment was great, and we enjoyed the outdoor pool and indoor pool. The on-site restaurant, Levante, is great for breakfast and have really good options for lunch and dinner. For our first holiday abroad since the beginning of the pandemic, we couldn't have wished for a better stay.",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,5

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Noelia T,24,Noelia Twrote a review Aug 2016,"We had the pleasure of spending 5 nights at Belmar at the end of July.  We were pleased with the resort the moment we arrived.  The checkin was quick and the front desk very professional.  The lobby is beautiful with a zen feel - water walls, quiet places to sit, reflection pool.  We had a 2 bedroom apartment in the main building and to our surprised we had a magnificent unobstructed ocean view (room D1G).  The apartment was well equipped and modern.  The beds were very comfortable.  Plenty of space for our family.  The beach is right across the street and it's great beach for families.  Fine sand and clean water.  We loved Porto de Mos beach!  There are two  restaurants at the beach plus a cafe/ice cream spot.  The indoor pool was a hit with the kids as the outdoor pools are not heated and rather cold. We did rent a car for 3 days because town was a good 40 min walk - 2 kms away. The front desk did it all for us.   We did tour Sagres and Cabo San Vicent as well as Pont da Piedade and surrounding areas.  We enjoyed going into Lagos centre for dinners and shopping.  .  We would  recommend this hotel and location.  Loved Belmar, loved Lagos and hope to return.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,ArcfireSG,215,ArcfireSGwrote a review Nov 2013,"Had a really good week here in late October. The location is superb, less than 100m from a great beach with two nice restaurants. Short drive to the centre of Lagos. The hotel itself is good, average 4 star. The 2 bed apartment was fine, good kitchen, two balconies, washing machine and dishwasher.Beds are like slabs of concrete like most places, this alone means I won't return. Shower is not great, no overhead just hand held in a holder.Staff are very friendly and helpful. Good spa and indoor pool which is good for Oct. Bar is not appealing and we never ate in hotel with two good restaurants on the beach just down the road.Apartment was only cleaned twice in the week.All in all enjoyed the visit though purely based on location, not on facilities.  I need a good bed and shower and this had neither.",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,3

Lisbon Destination Hostel,territakespics,36,territakespicswrote a review Jan 2018,"My husband and I stayed here right before Christmas and since it was our very first stay in a hostel, I was a bit apprehensive. We're mature travelers so I wasn't sure if we'd fit in or not. My fears were totally unfounded as we were made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and answered all our questions cheerfully. They made our stay extra special. There were other over 40 folks staying as well and we enjoyed relaxing and chatting with fellow travelers in the lounge area in the evenings.Besides the terrific staff, other positives for me were the security measures in place, the common areas, the bar, and the refreshments cooler. Once we were in for the night, it was nice to be able to get a beer without having to go out again. Our room was basic with a comfy bed, desk, night stand, wardrobe, and chair. No TV but it did have a mini-fridge which I didn't expect. Also, the staff left some wine, water, and cookies in our room which was a very nice touch. We had a bathroom in our room which consisted of a toilet, sink, and a very small shower. I couldn't turn around in the shower so that may be a problem for a larger person. That's a small thing in an otherwise very great stay!",Jan,2018,Jan 2018,2018-01-01,2018,4

1908 Lisboa Hotel,Karen R,0,Karen Rwrote a review Jun 2018,"My husband and I recently added on three days to our visit to Portugal and chose the 1908 Lisboa Hotel.  Located within a convenient walk to get anywhere, the hotel is beautifully refurbished and updated.  The building shape is noticeably unique with a triangular shape.  We spotted it right away.  As soon as we walked in, the service was outstanding.  Andrew took care of our car, arranged our luggage, showed us around the room pointing out all the features to make ourselves comfortable, namely the air conditioning and free phone to use with internet as we explore the city.  We were welcomed with a private “get to know the city” talk from Joann.  She spent at least 30 minutes showing us the map and helping us to plan or next 2 days.  She set us up with the bus tours, restaurant suggestions, and a wonderful private tour to Sintra.  We would not have been able to enjoy the city so efficiently without her guidance!  thank you to both Andrew and Joann!Awesome experienceWould love to come back!K and R RasconArizona visitors to PortugalPS the beds were super comfortable andThe breakfast we enjoyed each morning was superb!",Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,5

The staff is extremely welcoming and enthusiastic about Lisbon. I traveled there by myself and was able to meet so many great travelers from all over the world that were around my same age. Any question you had, the staff was able to help you and everything was kept very clean. I highly recommend eating the hostel's food. The chef is very good for a great price! Additionally, it is a very safe hostel with individual boxes in each room to lock up and 24 hour front desk attendants. I would highly recommend this hostel to my other friends traveling to Lisbon.",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,5

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Andy P,4,Andy Pwrote a review Jun 2017,"We stayed Forte Do Vale and had a superb holiday in May 2017.  We had a one bedroom apartment that was superbly serviced by Svetlana every day except Sundays.  While the room did not overlook the pool, we were lucky enough to have a west facing room with a nice balcony where we could wind down with a glass of Spumante from a hectic day of winding down, watching the sunset enabled us to re-charge our batteries for the evening ahead.  Spumante has re-invented itself and we found it tastier than Prosecco.The hotel is very spacious and the staff are superb.  We didn't eat in the restaurant although the menu and food looked good and we tended not to use the bar except for an aperitif.  We did use the pool area every day.The great thing about the hotel is that it is split evenly between 'The Strip' (if that's your thing and the the beach area.  A slightly further walk is the Old Town which is serviced by a road-train that happens to stop at the hotel.  Good atmosphere.  There are too many good restaurants to mention.We hired a car at approx 7.50Euros per day through Gold car and they were excellent - the car was booked a month before travelling and it enabled us to travel to many good beaches and towns.  We also bought insurance in the UK as it was cheaper.There are a bout 5 MGM hotels in Albufiera and we thought ours was the best - the others were under construction. so didn't have a pool etc.We will probably return to Forte Do Vale.",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,4

PortoBay Liberdade,Thomas C,3,Thomas Cwrote a review Oct 2017,"Definitely not to the standards of a 5 star hotel.Too expensive. 220 euros per night without breakfast in a classic room - doesn't worth the price.Staff pleasant but not very efficient (had to ask three times for a simple repair in the room). Hotel facilities and room a bit worn out.Cleaning staff forgot to renew some of the accessories (small towels, hygienic plastic bags).Feels like the hotel is just trying to sell you more services all the time (spa, restaurant) without any effort to provide a genuinely nice experience and without the attention to details that could be expected from a hotel in this category.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,2

Four Seasons Fairways,Adam W,254,Adam Wwrote a review Dec 2012,"We visit four seasons fairways once a year, and always travel off peak (February and October).Pros:During these times it is fairly quiet, and the food and drink in the bar/restaurant always arrives quickly. The staff are always friendly and go out of their way to help. One example is earlier this year we lost part of our juicing machine in our apartment. They provided us with a new juicer within the hour.The club area that contains the restaurant, gym, bar, snooker room, swimming pool etc is well maintained and staffed. Over the past five years they seem to have been updating their facilities. The last time we went the gym area had brand new equipment and (unfortunately) both saunas were out of action as they were being replaced.2 very well looked after snooker tables upstairs. It's also free.Free wifi.Food and drink prices seem average for the area.All apartments have either a small pool or jacuzzi.Cons:Outside pool is empty whenever we go as its usually around 10c outside, outside part isn't heated. I imagine the area would be very nice in the summer. Indoor pool temperature is also fairly cold, the jacuzzi is also colder than others I've been in.Nothing else really.Always a relaxing enjoyable stay. Recent change in management seems to have kept it to its usual high standards.",Dec,2012,Dec 2012,2012-12-01,2012,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Ed W,74,Ed Wwrote a review May 2016,"Beautifully located hotel overlooking the sea and a magnificent grotto the hotel is built on the side of the cliff, most of the rooms were below reception floor 5, you have to collect your pool towels from reception on floor 5 , the sunbed and pool area are on the ground floor 1 there is one kids pool and one adult pool and plenty of sunbeds with parasols + table tennis,Free wifi if join the Discovery program (GHA Loyalty), I joined online about 4 weeks befor the stay and already had my menbers card you receive a free newspaper every day and free wifi plus 1 bottle of water per stay ( not a day).The dinner restaurant and bar overlooks the ocean but the breakfast room was in a basementHotel is not the newest, it is well worth paying the extra for a sea view . The rooms have mini-bars, televisions (older generation) and hair dryers not very powerful, Storage space is limited  wardrobe hangers of fixed variety and located to high for short people Every day is cleaning, towels, replenishing tea, coffee and toiletries every day,The recption staff always friendly and helpful The bar drinks expensive 20% off for happy hour should be at least 50% offBreakfast was plenty of choice, but the quality of dinner was disapointing.There ars stairs down to the small beach but not right to the bottom you have to climb down the rocks the last 10ft.The town of Carvoeiro is over 1/2 mile down hill with cobbled pavements could be a proplem walking if you have mobility difficulties plenty of reasonable priced taxis are availble",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4

Saccharum,AlanT905,76,AlanT905wrote a review Jun 2018,I was on a 3 day fishing trip with a friend so chose the hotel due to its proximity to the harbour. Genuinely surprised to find a fantastic hotel upon arrival - great leisure and swimming areas - lots of space creating a true luxury feel. The rooms were equally good (although we were upgraded to a partial sea view room - actually a full sea view in my opinion) - spacious and modern - the open bathroom is a bit quirky. Food was excellent and service/music at the roof top bar equally as good. Highly recommended.,Jun,2018,Jun 2018,2018-06-01,2018,5

The premium sea view rooms are worth the extra cost.  The rooms are comfortable and the view spectacular.  I can't praise all the staff enough.  Without exception they were very friendly and provided amazing service, especially Donavon and Michelle at breakfast.  The village also has a great range of friendly restaurants so there is plenty of choice.  The hotel can set you up with whale/dolphin watching which was some of the best we've experienced.I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel and being out of Funchal the surroundings are peaceful with spectacular views.",May,2023,May 2023,2023-05-01,2023,5
Saccharum,Maximilian,1,Maximilianwrote a review Mar 2024,"The hotel is great for exploring the island but also for relaxing days by the pool or sea. Breakfast was generous, but could have used a little more variety. The entire staff was very accommodating and extremely nice. The two biggest points of criticism during the stay were the water temperatures of the indoor and outdoor pools, which could be a little higher. However, the most incomprehensible thing about this hotel is that the spa and the loungers directly by the pool each cost an additional €30 per person. This has never happened to me at any hotel in this category and I don't think it's appropriate for the overall impression of the hotel. The justification for making a unique stay possible, as with some other reviews here, is simply not conclusive. Given the price and the hotel category, the spa area should always be included. And charging another €30 for “better” loungers at the pool is totally incomprehensible.",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,3

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Caron G,42,Caron Gwrote a review Mar 2016,"This is a fabulous hotel with a great location on the beach and a short stroll to the marina. I travelled with a friend on a long weekend. The moment that we stepped into the hotel, the staff welcomed us and during our stay nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was clean and rooms were contemporary with extremely comfy beds. You are given a free of water each day, and a top tip is to seek out the ice machines which are slightly concealed on various floors. The bathroom is amazing. A fabulous walk in shower, lots of mirrors and even weighing scales! Plenty of free toiletries too. The bathroom is glass, however you can keep the blind down.We planned in advance to use the spa each day, and we were aware of the charge which didn't bother us.If you have a massage, then you don't have to pay the €11 to access the spa. The indoor pool is great with plenty of sun beds and at times we were the only people using it. The steam room, or hamman was lovely. Adjacent to the pool is also a walk in jacuzzi. The spa facilities were the best we have experienced. We both booked massages in advance which were great, with individual changing rooms inside the treatment rooms.The buffet breakfast in the hotel is fantastic, everything you can imagine. we loved the orange juice machine! We used the hotel bar a couple of times and had a jug of sangria which was lush.This hotel was the best that we have stayed in and we can't wait to return!",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,5

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Christine N,46,Christine Nwrote a review Feb 2024,Another enjoyable stay at this resort. Been having at least one  holiday a year at this resort since 1986 due to being owners. Seen a lot of changes some good and some not so good but I feel finally MGM are getting it right. Lovely apartment with good facilities. All staff were friendly yet professional and helpful. Only had one meal in restaurant which was a breakfast. Maybe it is a bit like a staff canteen but there was an excellent choice of food. Both hot and cold buffets with plenty of choice. We tend to self cater because we enjoy trying all the local restaurants but would definatley try the restaurant again.  The Oceon Bar for the evening entertainment can be very cold at this type of year so we used the piano bar more. Looking forward to our next holiday at  CPO.,Feb,2024,Feb 2024,2024-02-01,2024,4

Natura Algarve Club,CasaSandy,26,CasaSandywrote a review Sep 2010,"Stayed here 6-16 Sept with husband, and my mum and dad.  Massive rooms, very clean and well equipped (but no kettle - boil water on hob using saucepan).  Air con was available, you need to reduce the reading on the hand held remote to 20 degrees to get the room cool (it was about 30 degrees at least while we were there). No english channels on TV but not a prob for us.  Here are the positives:Good location, very quiet.  Clean spacious rooms with lovely pool area, pool bar/snacks at reasonable prices.   Walk up steep hill to road and there are about 10-15 restaurants/bars + a couple of supermarkets and an exchange facility.  The beach is about 700 metres away. Friendly staff, intercom available in room direct to reception if you need. The strip area which is more lively is about 15-20 min stroll. Few negatives for us though, namely:  there were only approx 6 parasol shades around the pool area for approx 40 sunbeds.  Three of them were non-functional too.  This was a huge problem for us as we need to lay in shade as can't take full sun.  Management told us they had masses of parasols at beginning of season but most had broken and they had not replaced them.  So we used the Ourapraia Hotel pool - turn left at top of hill, walk past supermarket and round corner and you will see wooden steps up to the pool area.  Free to get in, masses of sunshades and comfortable beds/pool bar/snacks etc.  Other negative for us was the bar closed at 11.30pm so you couldn't stroll back later than that and have a night cap before retiring to bed.  There were very few staff around to be honest most of the time we were there.  Although a good location for able bodied, it is not suitable for people with walking difficulties as there is no lift available to get you up with your cases when you arrive (or back down).  We were on top floor and my parents on 2nd so it was a job to get up the stairs with heavy cases (and my dad found the stairs quite tough going, plus walking up the steep hill when you exit the apartments).  The beach is down too so you have a hill to come up - fine if able bodied but not otherwise.  Other than that we had a lovely time!",Sep,2010,Sep 2010,2010-09-01,2010,4

Hotel Principe Lisboa,pierrejutras777,2,pierrejutras777wrote a review Aug 2016,"I found this hotel in Lisbon for a 2-day stay part of our vacation for my family, while waiting for our flight back to Warsaw. I thought it was an expensive choice, but ended up to be good for what was offered (breakfast, service, AC, Internet, location for Metro).  They have an excellent welcome and service, bar on site to get some food or coffee, and the staff even printed for me my Boarding pass for my flight.  It was an amazing choice as it was located just accross the San Sebastiao Metro station (last station from Red line, from Aeroporto station), we had access to the Lisbon city very easily, and just a 30-min ride to get back to Airport.  We could easily visit many sites from the Hotel, go for walks around in the safe neiborhood, and even go for a TelePizza meal just 2 minutes away (much cheaper than regular restaurant - great with teens!) on the same street. We could go on Sunay at 10 am to the Third Baptist Church of Lisbon for a beautiful service in Portugeese - just 5 minutes away on Filipe Folque St.  We totally recommend!  At Hotel, breakfasts are delicious, and include even those Lisbon-famous \"tarts\" from Belem. Internet access is excellent downstairs and in eating area, but was not that good from our rom on the 8th floor - but no big deal.   Great stay!",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,5

White Exclusive Suites & Villas,Slee,0,Sleewrote a review Oct 2022,"I stayed in this beautiful hotel with my husband to explorer São Miquel Island. It is a small boutique hotel in calming area of Lagoa. We had the ocean suite that looks out south side of the island. A comfy bed, clean room and small kitchen area to make coffees and AC worked great. It’s very zen and quiet place so you can get a good rest. The reception team( Joao, Rebecca & Sandra) were so kind and attentive and always looking out for us. The kitchen & dining team were also lovely. The breakfast was b/t 9-11am and everything on the menu were delicious. They also have the infinity pool which I only used one day but really nice. It felt so good to come back to the hotel after a long hike and just chill by the pool area. On the dry night, they put out a pit fireplace by the pool which is very romantic. Can’t wait to come go back to the Açore and stay here. Thank you everyone at White villas!",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,5
Legendary Lisboa Suites,boondie_oz,22,boondie_ozwrote a review Oct 2012,"We spent 6 nights at the Clarion Suites and found little to complain about.  On arrival we were told that our room would not be ready until the next day, but that they had arranged a room at another hotel for us at the same price.  So we spent our first night in a different comparable hotel and on our return to Clarion Suites the next morning were were allocated a street facing, third floor, suite.This suite was excellent and much more comfortable than the hotel room we stayed at on the first night.The breakfast room is limited in capacity, so if you want to eat inside be early or be prepared to wait for a table.  We found eating outside on the patio was refreshing on a sunny morning.Overall we found the staff most helpful and courteous, and had no issues with the cleanliness and cleaning of the suite.We would definitely stay at the Clarion Suites again if and when we return to Lisbon.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,4
Legendary Lisboa Suites,AnitaBGD,13,AnitaBGDwrote a review Jun 2006,"We stayed at Clarion for 8 nights late April / early May and loved it. The size of the suite was more than adequate with a spacious living area, good size bedroom, kitchenette and dining area, as well as a huge bathroom. The staff was extremely helpful, especialy the lady called Fatima at the reception desk! The room was clean and, even though facing the street, very quiet. Swimming pool area was well maintained, and we enjoyed it on a couple of afternoons, in conjunction with light snacks and drinks from the hotel's bar. Although we were warned that it was not quite centrally located, it is only 20 minutes of pleasant walk from Bairro Alto, and 5 minutes from Marques Pombal Sq metro station.The only downfall we found was breakfast. Though it is meant to be served until 11 AM, if you come down at 10:30, most of the food would be gone and no replenishment made. On the other hand, if you come earlier, you'd always have to wait for either bread, or eggs, or fruit, or coffee - there just seems to be a general lack of organization in the kitchen. Thankfully, Lisbon has many interesting choices for breakfast, so this didn't bother us much. As for Clarion, we definitely recommend it.",Jun,2006,Jun 2006,2006-06-01,2006,4

We arrived to the hotel and were greeted by super friendly folks at reception, joking and smiling and welcoming. The process was so quick, we were on our way to our room in no time.Our room was ridiculous. We had requested something with nice views for our special getaway. Pestana went above and beyond! There were 360 degree views from every room - of the ocean, mountains, other side of the ocean, park, gardens, etc.We spent so much time on our balcony, watching sunset and enjoying a glass of wine. The beds were so soft and comfy. Bathroom beautiful and marble (also with views!).The hotel itself is pristine. Clean, amazing views everywhere, great design. The grounds are impeccably kept, and there is a beach right nearby that you can walk / swim. It's warm, and no seaweed or anything.Also, this hotel's restaurant may be the only place on the entire island that has reliable dining service :) They don't rush you at all, but your food and check always come out in a reasonable time, which does not seem to be the case anywhere else. We always tipped.The pool is SO amazing. Warm, beautiful, deep, and right on the ocean. Could it be any more picturesque?? We are already so excited to come back. We've recommended the hotel to everyone at home. Thank you!",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,5
