The food is excellentand the small village of Carvoeiro is ready if you want to go out for a walk or go to a restaurant.

Saccharum,Chilli-Cymru,195,Chilli-Cymruwrote a review Sep 2015,"There are many things to say about this hotel which are very positive, but also some very important more negative comments which people should be aware of, in my opinion. I will start with the rooms. The rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious and the bed was probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in at a hotel. It is easily a super king or possibly emperor size and the mattress is firm, but not too firm. Our sleep quality was also helped by the excellent sound installation, meaning that you did not hear anything from neighbouring rooms or corridors. On the downside, or at least in my opinion, the ensuite bathroom is actually incorporated into the bedroom, rather than being in a separate room with a door. The shower is a transparent glass cubicle which is a generous size but completely unshielded from the bedroom. Although this means you can watch TV whilst you shower, you are also in full view of any other occupants in the room – which is not for everybody! The toilet is protected by a sliding glass door but there is no sound installation or really enough privacy for most people's tastes. The overall decor and look of the hotel is quite stylish and luxurious and, of course, the structure is new meaning there is very little wear and tear. That said, we were surprised that a number of things had already been broken or had stopped working and the ongoing maintenance appeared to be lacking. (Examples: the electronic darts for the darts board had been broken and not replaced during our two week stay. The shower cubicles in the spa had broken handles on the showers and the towel hooks on the wall in the changing room had snapped off, the bases around the parasols by the pool had been broken in high winds etc. There were plenty of sunbeds available on the eighth floor and on the second floor, although not all of them get the sun at all times of the day. One point that irritated me and is worth mentioning, is that you are given a pool towel each at the beginning of your stay and then informed that you will be charged one euro per towel for each time that you attempt to change it for a fresh one. Whilst I appreciate this as an eco-measure and they're trying to limit the unnecessary washing of multiple towels, I felt that making a charge to change your pool towel during the two weeks day was ridiculous. Equally, a €12 per week charge to utilise the safe felt like a penny pinching measure in a luxury hotel. Please also note that there is also a €6 per day charge to use the hotel carpark – something you may need to know if you have a hire car. That said, there is limited free street parking nearby. My husband was also disconcerted to note that there was no ironing ironing board available for guests and any ironing needs to be sent out to the hotel's laundry service - naturally at a charge. Similarly, you should be aware that the spa entry is €20 per person per day (although we had free spa access as part of our hotel package and this is therefore sometimes available depending on how and where you book). The spa treatments themselves were also a little pricey (€80 for a 50 minute massage), but the massage (with Keila) was fantastic and possibly the best I have ever had in a hotel spa. We were half-board, meaning that we had breakfast and evening meal every day, although we did exchange our evening meal for a lunch on one occasion. We did not feel that the quality of food in Madeira as a whole was particularly good and therefore, in the light of that, I would say that the hotel food was actually quite reasonable. That said, there was limited choice at the buffet and only one station from which to serve yourself, meaning that queues sometimes built up. It is also worth noting that the buffet staff were quite slow at replenishing dishes and often of the three or four options available only one or two was still available at any one time. The organisation in the restaurant as a whole was quite chaotic and it was difficult, particularly in the morning for breakfast service, to find a table. There was also only one chef ever cooking eggs, omelettes and pancakes, meaning that you could easily wait 20 to 25 minutes for an egg dish.There were insufficient staff throughout the hotel, including in the restaurant, so many tables were full of dirty dishes that hadn't been cleared and nobody helped you find somewhere to sit. This was the same every day for two weeks and it was also difficult to find somebody to serve drinks. There was often very little information about what food was being served, with inadequate or missing descriptive cards. On the positive side, there was at least one dish every meal which was tasty and the atmosphere in the restaurant was appealing. As regards the à la cart restaurant where we had lunch on the one occasion, we waited over an hour before we were served (again because of inadequate staffing). The only alternative to the à la carte restaurant for a lunchtime service was the pool or beach bar which had a very limited menu indeed. My reflections overall are that this is a nice hotel which could be very good indeed, but the impression given by the staff is that they are overworked as a result of being too few in number, meaning that they are sometimes less than friendly and very slow (I waited an hour for an extra towel for example). This is also the first four star hotel where glasses left out by people from the restaurant the night before are still around the pool at midday, or even the following evening.   If the staffing issues could be resolved, then I feel the hotel would be greatly improved. I made this point during our stay, but there was no sign that anything had changed whilst we were there and judging by the comments in the guest book on reception, this has been a problem since opening. I can only hope that it is an issue which is addressed in the future as this could be a lovely place to stay.",Sep,2015,Sep 2015,2015-09-01,2015,3

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,Rose456,40,Rose456wrote a review Apr 2009,"Nice building and layout.  Quite a secluded location.  Limited activities without a hire car if you don't want to sunbathe all day.  The hotel restaurant was very disappointing, we only ate there once and there was not much choice of places to eat within walking distance.  If I went to Madeira again I would definitely stay closer to Funchal as there is much more to do.  The room was clean but basic - fraying fabric covers over uncomfortable plastic chairs, faded synthetic blanket on the bed. There was free wifi on the beach but not in the hotel.",Apr,2009,Apr 2009,2009-04-01,2009,3
Hotel Cristal Porto,ehogan76,0,ehogan76wrote a review Apr 2022,"Yes, it is a little off from the \"city center\". but in a great way. If you are comfortable at all with public transportation you are only a few stops away. Otherwise, it's not an expensive cab ride.  I loved that it was quiet. The rooms were lovely (the bed was super comfortable). I really enjoyed the outdoor garden to have drinks and smoke. The staff was so incredible, especially Angela at the front desk, who gave me great recommendations for local restaurants, tours, etc. I highly recommend.",Apr,2022,Apr 2022,2022-04-01,2022,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,KatkinLeeds,26,KatkinLeedswrote a review Sep 2019,"We stayed at this hotel for 10 nights and had a great time. We were able to change rooms easily due to the noise from the bar across the road. We never had a problem finding sunbeds for the 3 of us by the pool. The pools and slides were great, the large pool easily catered for the large number of inflatables used. The food was great too no complaints, 8pm seemed to be a peak time where there was a short wait for being seated but other than that everything else was perfect. The rooftop bar was our favourite place to relax on an evening due to the atmosphere and view. We used the complimentary bus to the old town on numerous occasions its well worth using. All in all I would definitely recommend.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,5
1908 Lisboa Hotel,Alexander K,0,Alexander Kwrote a review Mar 2024,Our Lisbon trip took us to this Lisbon city hotel for 3 nights. The rooms match the description and are very tastefully decorated.Service and commitment are very important; we felt very comfortable.When we arrived there were small welcome gifts in the room (Pastels and cherry liqueur).Another positive thing to mention is the extensive breakfast buffet with great bread and some local specialties. Egg dishes were ordered a la carte and served freshly prepared.The location is also recommended; we will inquire here again first on our next trip to Lisbon.,Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,5
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Dave Fandango,70,Dave Fandangowrote a review Oct 2018,"First time staying here, though I've seen it many times.From the outside it looks like a compoundyou may find in a different country, and the entrance has a somewhat grand feel to it. However, after you pass the 5* sign outside, it stops being 5*.This isn't to say it's a bad place, it's not. But it simply isn't a 5* hotel and you will not get 5* service, rooms or stay. Mostly it's a good 3*.Location is somewhat good. It's not on the sea, but only 5 mins away, it has restaurants and bars on site and just outside, and is equidistant between the strip and the old town. It's pretty easy to drive to, or a short walk from usual drop-off points. The main road it is on, however, is irritating. Busy with cars day and night, and then the party goers at night into the wee hours. Especially bad as most rooms look onto the roads.Rooms are a good size, though balconies overlooking the roads are unattractive and virtually useless because of the roads there. Good beds, not good sofa beds. Adequate bathrooms, a kitchenette (erhem, not 5*...), the usual aparthotel stuff.Facilities - if you can avoid the gaudy 1990s trashy hotel video arcade, the bar with a pool table does a very good club sandwich, though it also does a very cringeworthy karaoke night that again reminds me of childhood holidays I'd probably rather forget. Another point to note - in a country that gets about 330 days of sun, the bar is in the basement and windowless. Probably alroght for sports, which it shows, though I wouldnt want to see the football crowd.The pool is only an ok size and in peak seasons will be crowded almost all day. There is a bar outside by the pool, but it's not cheap. The spa downstairs and gym are very good. Sadly, nobody pointed out this existed when we checked in, so I only found out about it the day I left! Therefore, I completely missed out. They're not 5* (again), but lots of equipment and spa looked very relaxing. Treatments available. Small indoor relaxing pool will be very good in winter. Though then again, it will be busier then because of it. Thinking of which, the pool outside will be unusable in winter, it's not heated. To round off the facilities, there is adequate parking and I would wager it is very safe.Service was good at reception, professional, efficient, helpful, really really good. Almost enough to make me want to go back! Sadly the rest of the hotel is not good enough to make me want to go back. Service in the bar downstairs was terrible. Housekeeping were helpful and efficient.Overall then, the hotel isn't bad if you can't get anywhere else that's reasonable. The communal areas are nice and clean, reception staff are really helpful, especially if you want to book any activities or need anything. It's good if you're driving. However, the rooms have no views, it's too busy outside, not on the beach, and you won't want to spend time on your balcony. Its location is ok but not central nor relaxing, nor on the beach. It feels like you're losing out a bit in every way, particularly given this is a pricey place to stay. My recommendation is, if you can, to stay somewhere else. I would definitely prefer the other Muthu properties in the area.",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,2
Lisbon Destination Hostel,Simone H,19,Simone Hwrote a review Sep 2015,"Not sure why this place is so highly rated..maybe due to the \"eco friendly\" Naturally they are reluctant to turn on the air con so the hostel is very warm which isnt great after walking around outside all day you would like some cool relief.In comparison with other hostels this one lacked atmosphere, felt like a number & little effort made to bring the travellers together of an evening except for the standard pub crawl.  Had hoped this hostel would be a little more original in their approach to travellers but wasn't to beWasn't told about the dinners during the introduction, even had to locate the bathrooms myself.

Casa Mitchell Apartments,jackie r,10,jackie rwrote a review Sep 2017,"Stayed for one week in the ground floor apartment with pool view, it was lovely very clean and tidy. Pool once up and running was fantastic plenty of sun beds and no need to place your towels out!!! Leo's restaurant across the road ideally placed for breakfast. Hotel is in the ideal place and just a short walk from the main square and beach. If you book through Thompson they drop you at the top of the road with no explanation of where the main reception is which is directly across the road who own both buildings there is a sign on the door but didn't notice this immediately. This is an adult only hotel poolside can be a bit quiet but if that's what your after then it's fab. Would recommend this place to all.👍",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,4
Dom Carlos Liberty,mh111,12,mh111wrote a review Nov 2011,"A group of us were looking for a convenient hotel on a budget to do some sightseeing and we were all very impressed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the beds were comforatable and the bathroom was spotless. The buffet breakfast was excellent with a variety of fruit, bread, cakes, yoghourt, cheese etc. The surrounding area doesn't have a lot of bars or restuarants but it is only a couple of minutes walk to the metro or bus stops.  It was also only 15-20 mins walk to the downtown Baixia area or to Barrio Alto if you want to go out for drinks or dinner and you could window shop in Prada and Armani on the way. The only minor point is that the shower could have been a bit hotter.Overall, I would say this was excellent value and very convenient and would definitely stay there again.",Nov,2011,Nov 2011,2011-11-01,2011,4

Vila Galé Albacora,Juan45,202,Juan45wrote a review May 2007,"We had a car, so were not troubled by the isolation. It´s a curious place, having once been a tuna canning factory, and there is a simple museum with a bit of background history.The staff were very helpful and spoke good English, and the rooms are spacious and clean. Breakfast was good and varied and one night we ate in the a la carte restaurant which has a nice setting on the first floor overlooking the river, but the food wasn't really worth the price. We didn't try the evening buffet.There's a large clean pool (only a metre deep!) with plenty of loungers in a pleasant garden setting.A separate building has a small shop on the ground floor, and a very good pool room, card room and a TV lounge. This is where the a la carte restaurant is, on the first floor. I got the impression most guests hadn't found this part of the complex, as it was always empty.The boat ride to the island is quite fun, and it's nice to ramble about on the dunes or in the woods.There's an excellent restaurant in Tavira high up near the castle, called A Ver Tavira. Bookings are advised.We got an internet rate of €140 for 2 nights which was great value. I'd recommend this hotel.",May,2007,May 2007,2007-05-01,2007,4

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Sandi112,78,Sandi112wrote a review Oct 2017,"Somewhat out of the way - so if looking for a convenient location - this is not it. The walk to the nearest metro station (by the Zoo on the blue line) takes about 15 minutes but once on the metro - you can be in center town at Rossio in 10 minutes - cost of return ticket about 3 Euros. There is no \"supermarket' close by but there is a little market in the train station - get your water and snacks there. Standard Marriott rooms - clean and modern. But far too many as hotel can be quite busy. Breakfast is good - lots of choices including being able to have fried eggs and omelets. Big downside is lack of free wifi in rooms - absolutely ridiculous. They want 7 Euros for this privilege. Free wifi only available in the lobby. Lovely pool area and gardens. Bar staff good and attentive - all spoke good English as well as the Reception staff. Close to airport - cost of fare was 6 Euros and some change. Was not allowed to print off documents  unless I paid for it - only a boarding pass for my flight was \"free\" - found this quite irritating for a business center. Food items in the \"recharge\" shop (if you wanted a water or a chocolate bar and other snacks) were quite expensive.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,3

PortoBay Liberdade,Alice Wong,20,Alice Wongwrote a review Oct 2015,Indeed the hotel is new & surely that could excuse many things but then the average price of a room at 250 euros/night is outrageously expensive. Two expressos and a milk coffee for 11 Euros when about 30 meters away the same order would amount to less than four Euros. The entire staff appears to have been scouted from newly minted college graduates who weren't able to find a job in their field. It's a miracle they were able to hold open the door. When trying to book the room I had to call 7 - yes 7 - times in a row until the front desk picked up! I don't really want to waste too much of my time but for the money spent this was definitely not worth it. Next time I would opt to rather get the most expensive Air BnB apartment available before I get worked up about the unskilled staff.,Oct,2015,Oct 2015,2015-10-01,2015,2

Villas D. Dinis Charming Residence Adults Only,Katris,88,Katriswrote a review Jun 2018,"Rather than a hotel, I would say this property is a collection of small houses. Each one is huge! I felt at large on my own; great size; appreciated it a lot, and think a family of many would even more.The location is great specially to go to Ponta da Piedade (on foot). If you want to go to the city center, however, it is a little bit farther away (works better with a car).I would say also the breakfast is a plus. A lot of options (better if you go early).There are pools all over the place as well (though could not use any, the weather was still cool in May).I do have a comment regarding the cleaning. One day I got to the room at 3PM, nothing was done. I had to actually leave again, even though I wanted to rest for a little while, to see if anyone would go to do the room. Then on the following day, in which I was leaving, a cleaning lady knocked on my door AT 11 AM: didn't they know I was checking out that day? Don't know. A pity, and something that the hotel should review with their staff, as the rest was impeccable.Also take into account there are several stairs around to get to the rooms, to the pools, etc. Not suitable for someone with mobility issues.Overall, I recommend.

It’s restaurants deserve their accolades, our favourite was the Villa Cipriani in its location set apart from the hotel with fabulous views, food and ambience, above all else though the level of service is genuinely exceptional, so professional and friendly, the general manager made a point of personally welcoming us at our first delicious breakfast…we will be back!",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,5

The food was plentiful and I was well catered for as a vegetarian. 5*.What let down our time was when visiting the loos and toilets there were staff shouting in the corridor to each other. It also looked very grand but on closer inspection the walls were marked and the toilets were not very clean. The service from the reception was also somewhat lacking as you expect to be greeted very quickly when reaching the desk rather than having to wait 30 seconds. Also, €20 for a token amount of tea in a metal pot!??The service overall was good but it does not compare when comparing it with Quinta Jardin Do Logo.",Feb,2020,Feb 2020,2020-02-01,2020,3
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Laneyg65,2,Laneyg65wrote a review Oct 2014,"Just returning from Forte Do Vale,  it's a lovely hotel, very clean,  maids came in every day except for Sunday.   We were all inclusive for the first time & was a bit apprehensive but the food turned out to be excellent. The room we had 224 was very spacious with washing machine & dishwasher, would be lovely for a family.  All staff were very helpful from the moment we booked in, especially Hugo in the restaurant & pool bar he was very courteous.   The hotel is ideally placed in between the Strip & the Old Town.   We used the gym which was good, there was also a Jacuzzi & indoor pool as well as the outside pool.  Entertainment at night could be improved on, although Elvis was very good!  The view from our room could have been better, there is a disused tennis court on top of the unused shops & if this area was made into a relaxing sun bed area perhaps it would be better.  All in all a great holiday,  lovely hotel & would definitely come back again.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4

The lights of Madeira make the view spectacular, Cocktails were expensive; twice that of our 5star hotel but worth it for the experience. The hotel is beautiful and the bar and waiting staff great.We visited again to attend a classical concert in the wonderfully decorated dining room. This again was fantastic and was reasonably priced including a class of wine.A huge disappointment was afternoon tea which we booked as part of our tour. We were seated well away from the other guests in a side room and thoroughfare to the toilets. The food was distinctly average although the scones were good, Champagne was 25€ ahead - we didn't try it. The staff were not unpleasant but they weren't attentive and we felt as if we were second class citizens.

Natura Algarve Club,aegh91,84,aegh91wrote a review Jul 2017,"Stayed here for a few days, it was a reasonable price. We needed to put a hundred euros deposit down which I thought was quite steep. Couldnt check in until 3pm, but could store luggage in room outside not the reception in a locked door. It was around 30 mins away from the airport. There was somewhere to get changed but was the showers and toilet to the pool. The room was very spacious large kitchen, with all facilitates, bathroom, bedroom with two beds and a lounge with beds and a balcony which was outside to the pool however although on ground level they did have shutters. Towels are provided, wifi is too but connection is poor. Only available in the lobby. The pool was clean but went mercy towards the end of the stay. There is a bar/food area. Food is reasonable price and tastes good. The bar had a good selection of drinks but service was very slow. There is plenty to eat around the area and a shop within a five minute walk. The hotel was clean but it defiantly dated. On first impression I wasn't impressed but for how much you use the room its okay. And the space was nice. The strip is a 10-15 minute walk away. There was aircon in the room too. I wouldn't call this luxury, it was cheep and cheerful and serves a purpose.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

Some are located in the main building, some larger and others smaller, which were the old cells. Others are located in a building 200 metres away, a little uncomfortable for cold or rainy days.We stayed two nights in room 122 2 years ago and now four nights in 126, both big, very comfortable bed, four pillows, good air conditioning and good size TV. Negative, to be corrected: morning noise in the hallways of the rooms caused by the loud conversations of the ladies of cleaning, which should be contained.Good breakfast buffet with reasonable variety of products.

The room was comfortable although the greenhouse like shower room and loo will not be to everyones taste. The pool area is well planned - there were enough sunbeds during our stay - in season there are beds and brollies around the garden - there is a childrens pool and playpark.

Natura Algarve Club,nevillepolo,18,nevillepolowrote a review Mar 2020,"We visited the Natural Algarve Club in Feb/Mar and were delighted when we arrived. The Natura was only partially open as it was early in the season but we still had fabulous service. The young lady who booked us in and was extremely helpful, we arrived mid morning so were expecting to  have to wait hours. As it was we only had to wait a couple of hours, just long enough to wander a few hundred yards f to enjoy a drink and some early lunch. The Natura is situated in a quiet area but still just minutes away from numerous bars, cafes and restaurants catering for every taste and budget. The pool area was clean and tidy with some comfy sunbeds. The apartment was larger than many, with a separate kitchen containing a full cooker, fridge,and a washing machine. We had e mailed the Natura to ask for a.ground floor apartment due to health problems and they went out of their way to ensure we had one. It was unfortunate that the snack bar and bar were due to open a few days after we left. We will definitely return, hopefully next year.

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,MissB1991,23,MissB1991wrote a review Jun 2019,"Firstly we were absolutely anxious to come here having read all the awful reviews but initial impressions were good. We arrived quite late at night, no porter to help us with bags or find our room which was a nightmare. We ended up going back to reception and a much more helpful young man told us he will find a porter and to put our luggage away til he is free, we were shown to our room which although was basic (what we paid for) was adequate. It even had a bath which is a huge bonus for me.The resort itself is really nice beautiful tropical gardens fountains and two beautiful swimming pools to cool off. The beach is a short walk away too. The food is very basic for all inclusive and limited to one place in the hotel and also the drinks are only in one bar. We ended up eating out for dinner most nights but breakfast and lunch was good. The restaurant manager Aman was really friendly and recommended places for us to go out in the old town.Just as the other reviews had mentioned it can get rowdy here although the first two nights were quiet our last two evenings were spoilt by a loud group of young men who came and went at all hours shouting and swearing. They broke the patio door glass everywhere dumped litter on the gardens and broke the security gate to the complex. We have reported this to the duty manager but we were too intimidated to do so at the time.As the title says mixed reviews as weâ€™ve enjoyed a short break and found the quieter pool nice to relax, the staff couldnâ€™t have been more friendly and helpful yet the type of clients let the place down. They say they donâ€™t allow stags and hens but if they book separately theyâ€™re powerless to stop them.Would we stay here again.. in a nutshell no.",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,2

The inside pool and jacuzy smell of desinfectants which make the place a bit intoxicating.The beaches are a short walking distance ( 5/10 minutes).

Eurostars Porto Douro,peebosity,52,peebositywrote a review Nov 2016,"Be very careful about the room you book in this hotel. The front rooms have a fantastic view onto the river. However the hotel is basically in a carved-out area of cliff, and the rear rooms look directly onto the rear rock at a distance of about 2 meters. I paid Euro 180 per night and was unpleasantly surprised to get a rear-facing room with little natural daylight - I would say it was worth about Euro 100 per night. I complained and got a room change the next day.If my whole stay had been in a rear room, I would have given this hotel one star in terms of quality-to-price. Given that I was moved to a river-facing room on my second day, and given that it is a clean modern hotel with excellent staff (actually the Portuenses as a whole are very nice people, it's definitely a great city to visit), and given that breakfast was reasonably good, it deserves a high rating. So I will split the difference with three stars, and this review is a warning to be careful about room choice when booking.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,3

Rooms are very comfortable and sound proofed.  The gym and spa are well-equipped.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Cons:  This is not located in what I would call the best area of town.  Unless you want cod for every meal, the restaurants are not that great.  They also do not match the quality of what  you would expect around a hotel of this type.  You may take a cab or metro to the part of the city where the sightseeing and shopping is located.  That will run you about 10 euros each way.  The restaurant in the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  Since you are basically captive unless you want to take a cab, they make sure to take full advantage on their prices.  1 bottle of sparkling water was 6 euros.  A latte was 6.5 euros.  Squash soup was 12 euros.  The quality did not match the prices.  I would definitely recommend that you take the  \"breakfast included\" option or you will find yourself having to take a cab to eat breakfast unless you would like to pay 35 euros.  If you have to get to the airport which is only 4 km away, make sure to ask for a regular cab which should be no more than 5 euros, because the hotel will call for their driver who will charge you 15 euros.  I fully understand that prices are higher at hotels, but this was over the top and offensive.  I would not stay here again for that reason.  You might as well stay at the Four Seasons which is better situated and a wash on price.",Jan,2015,Jan 2015,2015-01-01,2015,3

We were all very happy there and I would recomend it. It has quite a business feel to it though so may not be suitable for those more interested in the rustic. Its location is fine as it is in the CBD of Lisbon which is quite quiet and a bit away from the \"downtown\" bustle - but its not in the heart of everything.

Having been checked in we made our way to out suite on the 5th floor.

The minibar was practically empty and they were not able to stock it with anything other than two beers....The bed was uncomfortable & the TV so small & so far away that watching anything was a waste of time.In summary, this is the last time I will EVER visit a Villa Gale hotel as this experience was so bad I would not even wish to die here....I admit this was intended to be a romantic weekend away but seriously, a PLASTIC sofa ????

Viseu is a nice city of about 100,000 people but the old town which is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel has plenty of bars, restaurants, shops and historic sights.Well worth a couple of days stay or overnight on the way to Porto and the north of the country if travelling from Lisbon.",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,4
