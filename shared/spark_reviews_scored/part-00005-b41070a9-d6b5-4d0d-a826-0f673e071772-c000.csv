Artbeat Rooms,Dave and James,29,Dave and Jameswrote a review Jan 2020,Gosta on reception was brilliant. She kept in contact with me from the initial booking and met me at the property for check in. Very helpful and friendly. The location is right in the centre of Lisbon halfway between the Marina and Restauradores. The room is very comfortable and abstractly decorated which I loved. There tea and coffee available in the kitchen and the shared bathrooms are very clean. Highly recommended,Jan,2020,Jan 2020,2020-01-01,2020,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Chris C,3,Chris Cwrote a review Apr 2023,Lovely hotel. Cleanliness excellent. Staff literally clean up spillages in restaurant as they happen. Wi-Fi best I’ve had in a hotel. Download and upload at 50mpbs and can even pick it up other side of pool.Staff so efficient and friendly. Bar service excellent. Drinks in hard plastic recyclable cups in pool area or glasses inside. Big range of all inclusive drinks. Beer is Super bock.Great food selection in all inclusive with themed nights. Be prepared to queue 10-15 mins in the evening for a table if don’t turn up early.Great selection of pools for adults and kids. Even a few water slides. Great swim up bar.There was no towel reserving. No need as plenty of sun loungers. Always got one even on first day turning up to pool at 2pm and we needed 5.Great views from roof top bar.Only negatives are water pressure (we were on top floor) and evening entertainment average. Maybe it’s better in the summer. But in bar area they sometimes have a dj or a singer which were really good.Definitely recommend.,Apr,2023,Apr 2023,2023-04-01,2023,5
Macarico Beach Hotel,Irene L,0,Irene Lwrote a review Aug 2018,"We were looking for a nice restaurant to have local food beyond francesinha and tosta mista (love them, but too much of a good thing...) when we found Bico Real, the restaurant of this wonderful hotel. We have had an amazing dinner, authentic, with local dishes with a twist and a wonderful atmosphere. And dead classy! Highly recommended even by our 13 year-old girl!!",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,5

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,CH2708,16,CH2708wrote a review Jul 2024,"We spent a week at the Jupiter Albufeira with our 2 sons, 4 and 2 year old.We booked a private taxi service through Xclusiv4U which was so easy/convenient (highly recommended by the way).On arrival to the hotel, our room wasn’t ready so we went for an explore and our room was ready around 2:30pm. I emailed in advance for a quieter room and we were very pleased with it. We had a sofa bed & travel cot, the room was spacious and clean. The shower was very powerful - impressed! We were lucky to have 30°+ weather & the aircon worked very well.The main pool gets very busy but we enjoyed it there  most days. The AI drinks are ok…. Very small cups even for soft drinks! The lifts can be a right pain, especially as we had a double buggy. Sometimes we wanted 10/15mins to finally have an empty one arrive. The rooftop bar on floor 10 is really nice, could have spent hours up there 🌅The food is average, personally we thought there wasn’t much choice. We’ve stayed in another AI hotel in Portugal last year & we found the food much better. But you will manage to find something.We took a trip to Old Town with Uber (€6) for my husbands birthday/Portugal playing football. We really enjoyed it, worth a visit to mix things up. The atmosphere was great!Overall, we had a lovely week away in the sun. If the food improved it would make this hotel much better but you can’t have it all 😆",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,4

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Bellatrixx2,51,Bellatrixx2wrote a review Aug 2020,"We recently stayed here on our first holiday with our 1 year old. Our stay was absolutely brilliant from start to finish! We had an early flight so arrived 3 hours before check in, but the hotel was able to get us straight into our room. The whole hotel is lovely and modern and our room was very spacious. We had tea and coffee facilities and a bottle of water left in the room on the first day. It was a shame that the tea and coffee do not get refilled, but I made do with taking some teabags up from breakfast.The food at the buffet is easily the best that we have had at an all inclusive resort! I particularly enjoyed the Portuguese and Moroccan themed nights. The pizza at the Italian was incredible as well! We were a bit worried, as 7pm is a bit late for our toddler to eat, but they have a snack bar open in the afternoon which serves chips, burgers etc, so that kept him going! We also really enjoyed the selection of drinks available on the all inclusive. The mojitos are delicious, and the beer and gin were lovely!You are spoilt for choice with the pools. The main pool is absolutely huge, and we loved the swim up bar! There are two children’s pools and two quieter pools tucked away round the side. There are also plenty of sun beds and parasols. As mentioned in other reviews, the pools were a bit on the cold side and our little one would shiver if we took him in during the morning or early afternoon. They seemed to warm up by mid-afternoon though!The staff were all absolutely fantastic! The restaurant staff would bring over extra napkins for our little one and were always happy to fill up his water beaker. Manuel in the a la carte deserves a special mention- he really couldn’t have done more to make our visit to the restaurant more special, even bringing our little one a plate of melon (his favourite food) despite it not being on the menu!We had such a fantastic stay and will definitely be back in the future!",Aug,2020,Aug 2020,2020-08-01,2020,5

The hotel has ocean view from pool, pool bar, jakuzzi, room, restaurant and bar as well. You can eat, drink and enjoy the ocean!The breakfast was very selective, different cheese, salami, fruit, bred, cookie etc. Really good, you also get different fresh made breakfast from egg, bacon. The room was clean and cleaned every day, the room is big, beds has a good quality, i slept very well at nights (normally i sleep bad in hotel), big wardrobe with mirror, safe, fridge and you also get enough towels and bathrobe. Hotel has sauna, jakuzzi, indoor outdoor pools also with ocean view. The staff was very kind, they booked tours, you get free transfers, also free transfers from/to airport, you get picknick if you leave earlier then the breakfast starts.

Hotel Madeira,scantheman_9,28,scantheman_9wrote a review Mar 2018,"We went as 2 couples for 4 nights, 20th - 24th March. Short 20 minute transfer from airport, easy check in, if arrive early they will look after your bags at reception. Rooms light and airy all with A/C and very clean. Basic toiletries in room, plenty of clean towels,TV but limited channels in some rooms, very comfortable beds and do get turn down per se in the late afternoon/evening. You can pay for a safe just a few euros a day. Unfortunately no kettle/fridge or iron which is disappointing and we would have expected this for a 3 star hotel. You can pay approximately 3 euros per item and they will iron and pop in your wardrobe whilst out and about. Whole hotel is spotlessly clean and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Roof top bar and pool on 5th floor, accessed by a lift, fantastic views over the roof tops and lovely at night when dark and you can see all the lights. Hotel is in a perfect location, just short walk to bars/restaurants/shops and marina/port. Breakfast continental buffet style basic but fine, you cannot take a coffee or anything food/drink from the area so bear that in mind. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would return",Mar,2018,Mar 2018,2018-03-01,2018,4

Horta de Torrejais,An U,1,An Uwrote a review May 2014,"Waauw! What a great discovery! At the end of a dirt road, you bump into a little paradise.  A place to entice all your senses.The house is beautifully renovated, surrounded by a huge garden with a large pool. A green oasis, with trees, flowers and vegetables. There is even a little waterfall.The rooms are nice, rather small, but renovated in an authentic style. If you are planning on sleeping in, you have to take in account that you will probably be woken by birds, who make their nests in the roof above you. But this didn't bother us. It's in fact charming to get this close to nature.We enjoyed our breakfast at a beautiful decorated table. In the house there are several places to relax.The owners are friendly and speak different languages.We highly recommend this place!",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,5

Luna Clube Oceano,Jillybean,0,Jillybeanwrote a review May 2019,"We have just returned on Saturday from this hotel. From the moment of arrival we felt relaxed, from the lobby, to checking in to the hotel accommodating my request of high floor. The 1 bed apartment was spacious and had everything needed, little extras like iron and board in storage cupboard also clothes hanger/dryer, hairdryer etc. Kitchen had everything but an oven which I wouldn't have used anyway, I dont go on hols to make a roast chicken dinner but there was a hob, a microwave, toaster, a coffee maker, a kettle and all kitchen essentials. The sitting room was large enough with a table and chairs also and a lovely balcony with sea view. The bedroom was large with super kingsize bed (2 singles combined) a large wardrobe and a dressing table. The bathroom and shower over bath were great. Our room was cleaned daily.The staff were more than accommodating and friendly and a special mention to Daniella who organised our car hire for us, she is a very sweet girl and nothing was too much hassle for all the staff. The breakfast was also good and we worked out it was around €1.5 more than the local restaurant BUT in the hotel it was buffet style so you eat as much as you want and there was a great selection of fruit, cereal, breads and fried foods, also cakes and juices and tea/coffee, whereas in the local restaurants you get one serving of a fry on your plate so the hotels is well worth the extra €1.5.The pool and hot tub area are nice and clean and the bar service  is good also.The beautiful beach is literally on the doorstep and a few shops/ restaurants and bars also. 10 to 15mins walk either direction you are on \"the strip\" of the new town or in the old town. I thought the Luna Clube Oceana was perfect. I would love to return and hope to do so in the future.A******",May,2019,May 2019,2019-05-01,2019,2

( the old square far better than montechoro strip)I work within the travel industry and believe you get what you pay for- if you want the sea views and the bigger rooms then book and pay for a one bedroom apartment- all in all a good accommodation away from the hustle and bustle...",Jul,2008,Jul 2008,2008-07-01,2008,4
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,corrosio,68,corrosiowrote a review Oct 2014,"In fact we were in this hotel from July 28 to 29, 2013 excellent, spacious and comfortable room, with a king size bed and cozy pillows. Bathroom with bath and very good shower, everything spotlessly clean. Attentive to the extreme staff in all areas of the hotel that were frequented by us. Continental breakfast served from 6:30 AM on, but as our plane would take off at 9:00 AM we were allowed to have breakfast at 6:00 AM without asking if it was possible: just the kind attendant invited us into the restaurant and told us to enjoy!The hotel is well located, halfway between the airport and the center of Lisbon, with a taxi costing around EUR 15.00 to EUR 10,00 (airport or downtown, respectively). A 15-20 minute walk is the University City metro station, where one can go to the airport without the need for a taxi. The amount spent in this hotel was very attractive (less than EUR70.00), an excellent cost x benefit ratio. We will certainly stay in this hotel when we return to Lisbon in a near future.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,5

First and foremost the staff provide the absolute best service and are so kind, attentive and go the extra mile to make your stay special. We have had a double celebration with an anniversary and birthday and on both occasions the staff have remembered and complimented us with champagne in our room, a lovely surprise....thank you so much! Our room is perfect with the most idyllic view and I thank the cleaning staff for the welcome tidy and perfectly clean room that we come back to each day. The hotel as a whole is luxurious, relaxing and extremely peaceful and we especially love the 8th floor facilities with infinity pool and its incredible views and the whole layout centred around the bar/restaurant. We had the most memorable afternoons lazing on this level gazing out on the beautiful ocean in front of us. Other details? Breakfast - so many choices, something for everyone and fresh delicious food as well as champagne if you're in the mood for celebrating like we were.

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,janisScotland,62,janisScotlandwrote a review Jun 2017,"Just back from a week at this hotel.  Nice enough hotel but definitely not 5 star. The room we had was lovely  beds  and pillows very comfortable, also the view was fabulous. We were on the 4th floor with large balcony which had the sun for most of the day. This was the highlight of the holiday.  Most of the negative points raised in other reviews still apply, with exception of the Spa which opened while we were there. Before going I felt people were being a bit picky, however the management don't seem to be taking any action to rectify points raised. Air con not good, toaster is not up to the job. No shuttle bus available. Also you need to be fairly agile to go to the beach at the hotel, steps down don't take you the full way,  Only one restaurant available in the evening with limited menu. Mostly fish dishes. What we had was very nice, however we had to eat out for a bit of variety. Staff seemed fairly efficient and pleasant. Most days our room was not cleaned until nearly 4.00, and then turned down just after seven. Not efficient time management.I am being quite harsh with my review mainly due to my expectations which unfortunately were not met.Also check your bill carefully as we were charged for drinks twice.

The breakfast choice each day was outstanding, certainly something for everyone and everything was constantly being refilled and topped up when running low. The staff were very attentive and would check if you wanted any tea or coffee bringing to your table. They were also happy to assist you with anything else you needed like local bus times or other information. The location is also very good, right on the beach front and only a short walk from the Marina. The pool was great with staff on hand to provide towels and cushions for the sunbeds when required. The price of drinks in the hotel were slightly higher than elsewhere, but it is more than worth it for the service you receive.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,yijing84,12,yijing84wrote a review Aug 2016,"Our first impression for the room wasn't that good because of the old cigarette smell at the room entrance (we booked a non-smoking room), probably left by previous guests. We complained to the bellboy and he suggested us to open the door at the balcony to vent the air. It got much better afterwards so we didn't want to go through all the hassle to change the room. Well...we didn't smell much of it over the bedroom, so that was not a big deal.Apart from that, the hotel is excellent. Big room with huge bed and spacious toilet. The pool area is excellent with plenty of sun chairs. All the staffs are friendly and helpful. The location is good, right next to the beach. We swam in the sea everyday and came back to relax on the sun chairs by the pool.They offer good selections for the breakfast. However, the menu was the same throughout our entire 5-nights-stay, so we got a little bored after a few days. They also have a very good restaurant for lunch by the pool. I love the grilled sea bass that I had. The burger was a little dry, so I would recommend you to try the grilled seafood. The price was reasonable.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,4

Location is great as it is about 20 minutes from Faro Airport, a short walk to the Main Marina which has so many lovely places to eat and drink and a couple minutes walk to the beautiful beaches.The rooms have a spacious bathroom, nice comfy beds and a private balcony to sit and relax. We stayed on the 11th floor so nice and quiet.Breakfast buffet ad a good choice, the only compliant I have is that the water is not hot enough for teas and coffees so make sure you ask for extra hot water if you like a hot beverage with your breakfast.I thought the chefs really catered excellently for my brother in law who has a gluten and dairy free diet and he was very happy with the dishes they cooked for him.Spa is nice but you do have to pay a fee to use even though you are staing in the hotel.Like most pools the loungers get taken very quickly by 7am!

All staff were nice and friendly and reception area was bright and relaxing. Hotel only 5 mins walk from the marina which means that it is nice and quiet. Would stay there again.,Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,3
Hotel Gat Rossio,baseballfamily,5,baseballfamilywrote a review Nov 2015,"Can't beat this location.  We arrived at night and Aerobus dropped us off within a block of the hotel.  It was enchanting to turn the corner and see the pedestrian walkway with the restaurants set up and people out for the evening.  The hotel is basic but clean and comfortable.  Only complaint was the bathroom - it could use an upgrade and there was no where to put your toiletries but water pressure was good.  You are within easy walking distance of everything but also have the train station, metro and trams steps away.  Breakfast was well done with fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh bread, good coffee.  Only lacking in fresh fruit.",Nov,2015,Nov 2015,2015-11-01,2015,4
Cabanas da Viscondessa,JS3Travel,33,JS3Travelwrote a review Aug 2022,"We booked for a family group of 7 including 3 different generations right down to under 2 years old... A tall order to find accommodations that would be all things to all people. This spot was fantastic. One cabin accommodated us similar to a duplex where the other unit was a short walk away and was perfect for o family of 3. I have been to many islands over 4 visits and I can say this property is like no other! If you want to experience a forested hillside with million dollar views and a true \"island vibe\" this is your place.We booked rental cars to offset the 15 minute drive to the populated zones and found incredible balance of peace and convenient location by doing so. The onsite dining was great, but is the only walkable food option. In exchange, you enjoy true peace, quiet, star gazing, birds, trees, flowers and those amazing vistasOur journey to get to the Cabinas was full of drama with a delayed flight, a diverted flight and a surprise ferry boat needed to arrive about 24 hours later than expected and will no baggage... \"No problem, we will note your challenge and look forward to seeing you\" was the response. The staff helped us retrieve our bags, made sure we had some dinner (even though food service was closed at that particular time) and made our group feel comfortable. While none of our travel issue had anything to do with the property, the staff was empathetic and helpful.The vibe here is relaxed and professional. It's an eco-resort without pretentious flare and fabulous air conditioning if you need it. Management has embraced a stewardship and respect for the natural property and the island in general that felt genuine and inviting.Our whole group only had one complaint... our travel issues left is one day short at the property and we hated to hated to leave!This is a prime location for nature lovers, photographers, peace-seekers, or anyone who wants the booked property to be a big part of the Sao Jorge enjoyment experience. Treat this as 1-2 days of exploration for maximum enjoyment because if you treat this location simply as a staging point to go to other spots on the island, you are missing a big part of the value.The cabins are fantastic and more like a modern eco-spa than we imagined. For extra points, grab some provisions from the local market in Velas and take advantage of the full kitchen and private deck in your unit.We would 100% return and plan days just to soak in the property.",Aug,2022,Aug 2022,2022-08-01,2022,5
Hotel Albergaria Dias,Merle L,39,Merle Lwrote a review Jul 2016,"I can't remember how many times we have been back to this fabulous, friendly, fantastic and faultless hotel but here we are again.  Our arrival this time was even more friendly - hugs and kisses this time - so I think that everyone was pleased to see us?  It was delightful to see both Mr Dias snr and Mr Dias jnr again and they are still exceptionally proud of their hotel.  They pointed out all the spendid certificates that are filling up the walls in Reception and why not?I will not waste space by repeating what others have written because everything is just the same high standard so I will just give you an example of the help received.We celebrated our 49th Wedding Anniversary during our stay and Cecilia, on Reception, was a gem.My husband wanted to arrange some flowers and chocolates for the actual day and she organised him!  She organised the flower delivery for the correct day, explained where he could buy hand made chocolates and then she put them in the hotel's  fridge until they were required. On the actual morning, whilst we were at breakfast she went into action - the flowers and chocolates were delivered to our room - and rose petals were scattered on the carpet. What a wonderful surprize but typical of the kindness and service of this hotel.There will be changes soon as Mr Dias snr has bought the empty property at the bottom of the garden and will be transforming it into more accommodation once \"planning permission\" is granted.  We are sure that it too will be an excellent addition to this amazing hotel.Please book early and enjoy your stay - you will not be disapointed.",Jul,2016,Jul 2016,2016-07-01,2016,5
Canto de Luz,edward947,2,edward947wrote a review Nov 2023,"Prearrival information was very helpful.  The room was beautiful with lots of light from floor to ceiling windows.  We were in City 3.  The street was very busy, but with the double pane windows closed, the room was totally quiet.   The shower was one of the best in all of our travels.  Most importantly, the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We would definitely stay here again when in Porto.  If there is a downside, the hotel is up a steep hill, but of the charm of Porto, but if walking is a challenge, the hill might be an issue.",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,4

Bura Surfhouse,pdekoeyer,0,pdekoeyerwrote a review Jul 2017,"The term surfhouse is quite misleading as it is 20 mins walk from town beaches, and a 45 minute drive from surf beaches. The vibe is much more like a party hostel and none of the staff had any idea about surfing itself, rather were more interested in promoting party boats and nightlife.The hostel does not offer the surf transport/equipment or lessons, but sub contracts them out to another surf company and charges a commission for this. The surf is only suitable for beginners as they provide foam boards and go there in the middle of the day when the beaches are crowded. As an intermediate surfer this was quite frustrating.The staff were incredibly disorganised and too worried about partying themselves rather than doing their job. All activities are an extra cost. Rooms are hot and dirty, beds squeaky and there are not enough bathrooms.If you want to surf properly, rent a decent board in town then head to arrifana, aljezur or sagres.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,2

It was very clean.We enjoyed getting fresh bread every morning at the door. The staff are very nice and helpful.The information book in the appartment was interesting.The only problem was that the bed was little bit small and not very confortable.The doors are small which means you can bang your head easily.",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,4
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,chrisandmac,30,chrisandmacwrote a review Jun 2012,"An adequate hotel if you get a cheap rate. Our room faced the petrol station - good to watch the storks nesting but not pretty. Room was very clean and housekeeping excellent. BUT we found the beds extremely hard. Prewarned by other Tripadvisor reviews we had taken two small foam cushions with us and that saved our hips - we are active late 50s and both had sore hips after the first night so how the many much more elderly guests cope I don't know.  On the positive side the A/C was one of the best we've found - quiet enough to sleep to and works well.Breakfast is OK but evening buffet varied between quite good and very bland/dry. We were on a dance holiday and so didn't have high expectations of the food anyway but if you have the choice, there are so many good restaurants in Tavira that B&B is definitely the way to go. Best thing is the free transfer bus  to the sister Vila Gale Albacora - from here you can get to the beach, Tavira island, or wander through the salt marshes watching fantastic bird life.    We would definitely go back to Tavira but if we could afford it would stay at the Pousada de Graca - we had coffee there and it looks fab!",Jun,2012,Jun 2012,2012-06-01,2012,3

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Jammymildred,59,Jammymildredwrote a review Jul 2013,"Before visiting Vila Gale we read some comments about it being more suitable for older guests and lots of \"Saga\" visitors.  The hotel does have Saga visitors but when we went it was very busy with mostly families and young children and very noisy generally.  Our complaint is that the evenings in the bar and pool area are very noisy.  Three nights a week the children's \"fun club\" has their entertainment in the bar and if you go out to the pool area, there is a \"DJ\" with very noisy music blaring out.   Therefore, if you want a quieter drink, your only option is to sit in the foyer area, which is okay but at the end of the day, you are still in Reception!   Drinks expensive also.  My Pina Colada was poured into a glass from a sort of large plastic container - ready mixed - and not good at 6.50 euros....Entertainment in general was a bit corny.  The hotel needs to take care of the needs of ALL its visitors with a separate area for children's entertainment and an area for adults who do not wish to be deafened!  Breakfast buffet was excellent - masses of choice and hard-working efficient staff keeping everything topped up.  Beds were a bit uncomfortable and double rooms had 2 singles pushed together - not acceptable in a 4 star hotel.  Room cleaning a bit hit and miss and not of a high standard.",Jul,2013,Jul 2013,2013-07-01,2013,3

However we didn't let this spoil our holiday and I still give the place a five star review because everything else exceeded our expectations.",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,4

Yes! Lisbon Hostel,Jeremy H,3,Jeremy Hwrote a review Sep 2016,"Do you like food?Do you like beers and sangria?Do you like FUN?Come to this hostel. The moment after ringing the doorbell to get buzzed into the building, you enter this majestic hostel. Greeted with a friendly reception, the hostel itself also bodes with an inviting warmth and community.Included in the Price: Free Breakfast (you just have to clean your dishes in the kitchen yourself after). For 10 euro each night - recieve a 4 course dinner: starter usually being some type of bread and dip; second course, a soup; followed by a main (typically, cod, chicken, or some pork, but is always delicious); finally concluding with a dessert. During this time, you can also fill yourself up on free beer or sangria! What a deal!.....BUT WAIT....there's more!!!Basically, you can sign up anytime before 11:30 to join the pubcrawl that leaves from the hostel. Of course, prior to leaving, the Hostel pours a shot for each person; preceding the shot is a chant.The pubcrawl starts at 2 bars, followed by a club. I have neglected some of my memory during these pubcrawls for obvious reasons - they're too fun!!! But, here is what I DO remember:The free beer and sangria continues into the first bar.The second bar, a free shot is usually given and any other drinks are bought. However!!! I believe, there are also nights that free drinks continues onto the second bar too (I'm not totally sure haha)The final destination - a club - is usually late at night; but, they usually try to save the best for last. By this time, not many drinks are needed anymore; if they are, they must be bought.The entire Hostel is such a friendly environment. Everyone quickly becomes friends, brought together with food and drinks or just good times!Free walking tour every morning leaves from the hostel @ 10:30. One day the tour will cover the east side of town; the next day will the west side of town.There are also tours offered by the Hostel to amazing locations around and close to Lisbon.The Hostel is located two blocks from the water, and only 1 block from PraÃ§a do ComÃ©rcio (the main public square in Lisbon).I could talk all day about this amazing hostel all day! If you are staying anywhere in Portugal, make note to stay here.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

A floor lamp apparently had a bad switch and I finally had to unplug it to turn it off at night. The bed is hard but manageable. The biggest issue was that I mistakenly used my room key at the room next door and it opened. A very surprised and startled guest greeted me.
