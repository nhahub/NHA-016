Herdade Da Matinha,Ana S,0,Ana Swrote a review Feb 2020,"We stayed in a family room and these ones clearly need to be updated - the air conditioning was notworking and the shower is too small and not prepared to give bath to babies . The restaurant in thehotel should have more choices in the menu. As it is, the local cuisine is not represented and it is tooexpensive. On Sunday morning, one of the bedrooms didn't have hot water in the shower. Hotel is not customer oriented. Has a lot of potential though...",Feb,2020,Feb 2020,2020-02-01,2020,2

Life guards on duty and the entertainment staff keep kids busy during the day.Water slides good fun, although become a bit boring (sorry, this is a bit harsh)……if there was one higher, more exciting slides it would be almost perfect.Hotel cleanliness was so good, always spotless.Did I mention the food……it was so good, along with the drinks choice.Great choice of hotel and will definitely be going back",Jun,2023,Jun 2023,2023-06-01,2023,4

Food and drink was good, entertainment was varied and my daughter loved the mini disco and slides. Rooms spacious and clean. The shuttle bus to the old town and beach was great and you can walk to the strip and another beach but it’s a steep hill - beware! The one thing I missed was a bath but that’s personal preference.",Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,4
The Boliqueime Inn Hotel,AndreaBen,0,AndreaBenwrote a review Oct 2012,We ate here mid-week (on our last night) with my 2 year old son.  We were greeted warmly and my little one felt comfortable in the lounge wandering about and looking in the pond!!  We ate in the restaurant and although my little boy had grown tired (entirely my fault for arriving later than planned!) we had a lovely meal.  I had the liver and onions and it was wonderful - the meat just melted in your mouth and the vegetables were cooked to perfection.  Mum had the homemade pie and fell in love instantly.  I only wish we could have returned to sample more of the menu!  We certainly will when we return again in the future.,Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,5

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,whyshyme,122,whyshymewrote a review Sep 2021,"It’s no secret that this hotel is something special; from the views of the ocean to the simple fact it is located on a cliff. With the positives generally outweighing the negatives, visiting this place should be on your bucket list (it’s definitely on mine!).I was impressed with how modern and minimalist the hotel looked, with wooden furniture paired with slate flooring and white walls. With an option to choose either a garden-facing or ocean-facing room, we’d gone with the ocean view. I’d really recommend if you enjoy listening to the waves, as it was so calming that we kept our balcony doors open. The room itself was clean and tidy, with air conditioning and everything available if you wanted to make yourself a cup of tea or coffee.",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,4

Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Bruxelles32,99,Bruxelles32wrote a review Nov 2016,"If you are a golfer and you would like to play the acclaimed San Lorenzo course you may accept some of the hotels flaws and pretend it is still worth 5 stars.However,if you are not a golfer don't be fooled by glossy web presentation. The only one thing which has been renovated is the lobby. We have stayed in a deluxe room on the 5th floor which surely had not seen a renovation for at least 20 years. The furniture was worn out, the bathroom very poor, the complimentary coffee machine was there, but not connected to electricity and no socket nearby. Throughout the hotel there was an unpleasant smell. The service in the bar was poor and the drinks on the steep side. By the way a 0,33 l bottle of mineral water from the minibar will set you back by 5€. Breakfast was plenty, but the experience was taunted by the very unpleasant smell from the cooking station where egg dishes were prepared.",Nov,2016,Nov 2016,2016-11-01,2016,2
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,a k,10,a kwrote a review Jul 2019,"Breathtaking location on a cliff, beautifully maintained gardens and pool and a lot of more or less secluded spots with sunbeds, beanbags or chairs to enjoy the views. Beautiful bright and spacious rooms. Copious breakfast. What we liked most is that they will do everything in their possibility to make your stay enjoyable. A few examples; the sauna closes at 9 pm, but if you want to use it later, you just ask and they will adjust the timer for you. The hotel has a service that will drop you at a starting point for levada walks (location differs with the day of the week) at no cost at all. For longer walks they provide picknic which will cost you only 8 euros and pick you up at the endpoint. If the poolbar is closed, you can still enter it and grab a drink yourself. Just fill in the slip which is provided next to the fridge, note what you took and your roomnumber and all is OK.",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,4

As with any buffet service you could end up with food that was sat there for a while but it was more than edible.We both could not believe the size of the apartment when we walked in.A great place and would definitely stay here again.,May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,5
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,Badgerbrown,11,Badgerbrownwrote a review May 2015,"My Partner and I have just returned from having one of the best breaks I have ever had. Superb hotel, great food, good room and perfect weather. Above all, the staff were wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble, even getting coffee and croissants at 4am! The room was one of the last few to be renovated but we loved its rustic charm with polished floor tiles and spacious quarters. Very clean with a great view and a balcony. Two large double beds which were supremely comfortable.A special thank you must go to the staff at the swimming pool bar and to the breakfast crew. Breakfast was full on yummy with just about anything you wanted (Tetley tea and Marmite included!) plus custom cooked omelettes.We must also thank the delightful Manager, Luis Filipe who spent a good 15 minutes chatting to us about the hotel history and the current renovations during a complimentary drinks party the hotel organised. A very charming and warm person.So although I don't play golf, I will be going back again as soon as possible!",May,2015,May 2015,2015-05-01,2015,5

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,silarem,127,silaremwrote a review May 2014,"We knew the hotel was far from downtown and since it was the choice of our tour we had no choice. We were glad that they let us do an early check in at 10am. The room was big for European standards; they even added an extra bed, as we were three adults sharing a room and still there was space to walk. The room had a small balcony, desk, tv and a small fridge. The restroom look a bit old, maybe because of the rose color tiles but it was perfectly functional and there was plenty of hot water and good pressure. As others said, wifi is only available in the lobby unless you want to pay a fee to get it in your room.Breakfast was excellent even tough we didn’t have the omelet station (maybe is not for tour groups?). One night we had a very light dinner at their restaurant (we couldn’t find at 9pm a place close by open for dinner) and it was good but the service was slow and of course it was pricey (1 cup of caldo verde and 2 cup size vegi soups without bread or even water $22 usd). Around the hotel there is not much to do  (or eat) and to get to the closest metro station is around 5 euros, the same if going to Colombo Mall. To get to Rossio square was around 10 euros and taxis are available all the time which is very convenient.  All in all it’s a good hotel if you have your own transportation or if you don’t mind paying for taxis to get everywhere or if you want to rest.",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,4
PortoBay Liberdade,GRANDPA P,2,GRANDPA Pwrote a review Jun 2015,"New hotel but reaches the standard set by other hotels in the Porto Bay group. The welcoming and positive attitude of all staff sets the bar exceptionally high. The hotel is well situated, quiet and both the bar and bistro offer excellent facilities.The wine list is exceptional offering a wide range of Portuguese wines including Port and Madeira.The rooms were well equiped and well laid out. A plus for travellers are the USB chargers - no need to take adaptor plugs anymore.We will return.",Jun,2015,Jun 2015,2015-06-01,2015,3
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Jaroslaw S,231,Jaroslaw Swrote a review Nov 2017,"The hotel has been in continuous decline for years. Especially the service is bad and rude...unless you are used to McDonalds ...then you will be happy with this facility.Internet most of the time extremely bad, even tho I was offered and enhanced wifi...imagine what you get as a regular speed.In winter season the A/C offers only cooling function. You have to wait 80 minutes before the technician appears. Then when you leave the room and come back- same story.They sell rooms totally not appropriate for use and charge you in advance. If you ask for a room change...they are fully booked (mostly with airline crew from Africa or KLM who do not have a word to say to change it).Attached are the pics from their lounge. You pay for this and on the pic you may see what you get in return.",Nov,2017,Nov 2017,2017-11-01,2017,1

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,M98025,97,M98025wrote a review Aug 2014,"My sister and I have just returned from a pleasant 9 day stay at this hotel. We liked the fact that it was away from the centre and found it quite easy to walk to the metro station at the zoo in the mornings. We also took advantage of the free open top bus pick up several times. We liked the traditional style of the hotel and our room was excellent - a good size, plenty of storage space , beds were comfortable and we had everything we needed. Staff were friendly and professional at all times. We found it very convenient having the 24 hour shop behind reception where you could purchase drinks and snacks.The hotel is very busy, as it is popular with large tour groups, but the staff are very well organised, so we didn't have any issues. Our room was on the 9th floor and we couldn't hear the road with the balcony door closed. The hotel is on the flight path, but most of Lisbon seems to be and we did not find it disruptive.As other reviews have mentioned, there is renovation work going on within the hotel, which seemed to start before 8:30am and finish at about 8 pm. They were obviously trying to work as quietly as possible and we were not too bothered by it, because we were out exploring all day. However,  the drilling, banging etc were a little annoying when you returned tired after a long day of exploring and just wanted to relax. We were surprised that they had chosen to renovate during the summer months.Despite this, the staff were doing their best to minimise disruption and we still enjoyed our time in Lisbon. We would happily stay here again once the renovations are completed.",Aug,2014,Aug 2014,2014-08-01,2014,4
Quinta do Furão,Alfie B,136,Alfie Bwrote a review Apr 2013,"Reading the reviews and ratings I had expected much better. As you arrive at the road to the hotel from the advertising board you sense this is a hotel with organic roots, surrounded by organic vineyards, grows organic vegetables etc. in essence a really nice place to stay, we didn't  see much evidence during our stay in fact there was only one organic wine on the list and little reference to it on the menus and only two of the four Madeira wines offered at the wine tasting came from the hotel vineyards. More could be made of this.It's got a great cliff top location, with views along the peninsula coast line as well as a backdrop of the Madeira hills, the hotel looks great! Our first impression was a gloomy reception, with a pleasant receptionist who in our first few hours seemed to do everything, check in, take and serve our lunch order, get our drinks - were they short staffed? The lounge area is dull, pretty unwelcoming and lacks atmosphere. The one positive was the log fire which was welcomed on some stormy nights.It's a great base for coastal and levada walks but there isn't much else around if you don't have a car. The restaurant was recommended and we were on half board. This means you get a limited set menu,rather than a la carte. The set menu has a Traditional Menu for €3.00. extra which never changed its two main courses in the three nights we were there which was disappointing. The standard menu gave three starters, main and dessert choices which did change. To be honest, they were very average in quality in general with the odd dish that was ok and even on the half board deal we still probably spent (over three nights) another  €80 on water, drinks and coffees. There is an a la carte menu but we weren't offered it, you would think, even if on half board, you could get an allowance towards the a la carte menu for some variety, and it would help he hotel spend. The restaurant staff were very pleasant and offered to replace sub quality dishes, but that isn't the point is it? By the way, the restaurant is about 100m away from the main hotel so make sure you have a coat or umbrella (provided in the bedroom) as you can get soaked if its raining.Our accommodation was on the third floor and rooms were spacious, good bathroom with a bath (great after long walks), but fairly simple in decor. The safe lock was antiquated and tricky, there was a good TV with Sky news and Wi-Fi was available throughout the hotel. We stayed during a very stormy wet and windy period and the lack of tightly closing windows left the wind whistling through the gaps like a haunted house. Nothing helpful for guest information in the rooms, not sure why not?In summary, it was ok but not great, clean and comfortable. Would we go back or recommend, probably not, but perhaps for the area we are expecting too much?  It could be great though if the owners/managers worked on selling its strengths, improving the food quality and building on a reasonable front of house team - there is however something missing atmospherically.",Apr,2013,Apr 2013,2013-04-01,2013,3
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,Yodeller,0,Yodellerwrote a review Mar 2024,"Very small room. It was stated that there was a balcony which there is so thought that would compensate for small room.

Four Seasons Fairways,WRB_Kawakuchi,156,WRB_Kawakuchiwrote a review Apr 2016,"We have previously stayed at the Four Seasons Fairways resort in their well appointed villas and hillside apartments( all with private pool or jacuzzi/hot tub).On this occasion we had an opportunity to stay in one of their recently refurbed F style apartments ( 186 m2) with terrace,private pool,3 bedrooms, 2 ensuite and another shower room. Absolutely delightful with loads of space in the open plan kitchen- dining - lounge areas. Kitted out with top range equipment from Miele, Braun,etc.Given the quality and service of the well managed resort it's not surprising to hear that Membership ( especially their very financially interesting winter and winter plus schemes) and holiday rentals is increasing.The clubhouse has a friendly atmosphere(log fire in the winter) with bar/ restaurant and the well appointed gym, indoor and outdoor pools, and steam room/ sauna as well as the golf shop offering tee booking service and the kiddies club.The resort restaurant in the clubhouse offers great fine food as well as bar snacks at very reasonable prices especially in its location surrounded by world class golf courses, hugely expensive villas.However it's not all about \" man made ideals\" as less than 1.5 miles at the beach area is the bird spotting paradise of the Rio Formosa with a number of dedicated bird hides.With our own bikes ( you can hire them via the reception) there are lots of pleasant cycle rides around the relatively quiet Quinta do lago estates\" dreaming of which multi million villa to buy with your next lottery win\".It's easy enough to cycle down to Vale do Lobo resort or the beach area such as Julia's for lunch. Our favourite is the bike ride around the eastern side of San Lorenzo golf course to the dedicated walking/bike track alongside the Ria Formosa estuary to the road next to the Faro airport runway and from there across the causeway to Faro Beach where there are lots of good bars/cafe and restaurants where a sea bass lunch can be had for less than €10. Approx 10 mile round trip, returning via Ave Jordan past the Quinta Do Lago hotel.( you can easily follow the route on Google Earth and parts of it on street view if you have never been to the area)Faro airport by car is only 20 minutes away, excellent supermarkets ( Apolonia or Pingo Doce) in nearby Almancil as well as smaller Pingo Doce on the QDL estate. However the shop on the FourSeasonFairways resort is well stocked and very similar pricing to large supermarkets. Loule market on a Saturday morning is a lovely experience - clear evidence of how local producers can succeed.We are now regular visitors to this special place, in November and March when the sun shines a lot warmer and longer than in England !",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,4
Independente Principe Real,Melanie T,9,Melanie Twrote a review Jan 2016,"We stumbled upon this place while walking around Lisbon and after eating lunch at the restaurant inside, decided to book the hostel for our last night in Lisbon. We ended up booking a private suite on their website once we got there because my boyfriend wanted to have his own bathroom and get a good nights sleep before we flew out the next morning. His sister did end up staying in the hostel and she said it was one of the best she'd seen. There were a lot of people hanging out in the lounge, making food and drinking wine.  It was only 40 euros for our beautiful private room (I think because we booked on the day of, they have a special price online only and in high tourist season is probably not possible) which we thought was an amazing price and a much more interrsting place to stay than a typical chain hotel.   It's in a fantastic location with a view overlooking the city and it has a really cool mix of locals and tourists at the restaurants (the decadente is in the hostel side and the insolito in the private suites side) Inside it feels like a mix of vintage furniture with modern stuff mixed in, which beautiful vintage floor tiles in the bathrooms and a lot of character. The room came with a free breakfast which we had to take with us to catch our flight but it was also great. Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone staying in Lisbon even at full price! Definitely check out the restaurants if you are around, the decadente has a beautiful backyard beer garden and the insolito has a fantastic view of the city... Highly recommended as hostel, hotel, and restaurant!",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,5
PortoBay Liberdade,Roger,23,Rogerwrote a review Jun 2016,"We stayed for 4 nights as our first city break in Lisbon and in our opinion we could not have chosen a better hotel.  All staff are genuinely friendly, warm and efficient - nothing is too much trouble.  Breakfast is superb.  The hotel is an oasis of calm in a side street off the main Avenue Liberdade down which you can walk to the main centre and the old town in about 15 minutes; alternatively the nearest metro is a few minutes walk up the avenue.  From that station you can go a couple of stops up the line to San Sebastian station for the remarkable Calouste Gulbenkian Museum or you can go down the line to the centre of town...the hotel's location is perfect.  During our visit the building opposite the hotel was being renovated so there is construction noise during the day, but we had a room at the back which was completely peaceful.  We will return to Lisbon for another longer visit and we will choose this hotel for sure.  Tip: If you plan to visit any attractions be sure to check their opening days/times on their websites as many have changed from what is stated in even recently published guidebooks.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,5

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Mandy S,0,Mandy Swrote a review May 2016,"We had a great 12 day stay at Tivoli Carvoerio.  This is a nice, friendly and surprisingly quite hotel. Good value evening buffet so look out for promotions. Join the hotels Reward Program to get free wifi and daily newspaper.Good size sea view rooms.  A little dated but very clean.  Take a hair dryer as the hotel ones are fixed to the bathroom wall and useless.  The room we stayed in had a shower curtain over the bath and we all know they are a real pain... Small little bottle fridge so the is handy for the odd bottle of wine from the supermarket. (take a corkscrew). Single beds are narrow so I'm not sure how big the double beds are.  Rubbish pillows... The wardrobe has those hangers that you lift out and and then fight to get them back in the hook on the rail. If you re smaller than 5.3 you wont reach them lol... 25 euro deposit of the safe lock. (small?Nice pool area and not the usual rush for sun-beds.  Plenty of space and beds.  Pool towels are free.  No beach next to the hotel.  The walk into Carvoeiro is about 10 to 15 min down hill...Mini bus in and out of Carvoeiro was 10.30 - 2.00 and 4.30 so no evening service.Lots and lots of bars and restaurants so plenty to choose from.",May,2016,May 2016,2016-05-01,2016,4

Not very customer friendly. All the paying sections were empty. Even the premium Sundeck for 80 Euros per day, empty. If you want to use the SPA, 30 Euro.",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,2

Hotel Gat Rossio,mep23,58,mep23wrote a review Jun 2016,"I stayed in seven different hotels during my euro trip and this one was definitely the worst. The poor design of the room, the fact that it is worn down, the crammed breakfast area and its location on a street where you get harassed to eat at every restaurant makes it quite uncomfortable. Also, the staff at the front desk misinformed me on multiple occasions, leading me to waste many hours and many euros. I would definitely suggest looking for another hotel. When I think of how much I spent to stay here, I cringe.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,1

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,elianakkaram,2,elianakkaramwrote a review Dec 2019,"My partner and I stayed at Altis Belem during our stay in Portugal for a night during our holidays in December 2019. We loved every detail of history at the hotel. Bruno Pinto Correia welcomed us with a tour of the hotel and a brief of the history behind it, the ode to the portuguese discoveries and the departure from Tagus River. The hotel is perfectly located along the River, overlooking the marina from one side and the Tower of Belem on the other side. It is the best place to be for a walking distance from historical attractions. And if you love running, or even taking long walks in the early mornings, you can easily kick off your run/stroll in front of the hotel for a 10km of scenery! The staff are amazing, super helpful and welcoming (thanks to Dario for guiding us upon our arrival!). I personally loved the location of the hotel and the touch of history in its architecture. The Breakfast is great, you will also find vegan options like plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables for breakfast and also granola and non-dairy milk (you will only understand if you are vegan!). Overall, it was awesome waking up at Altis Belem, would definitely come back for another stay on my next visit!",Dec,2019,Dec 2019,2019-12-01,2019,5
Pestana Viking,Lee E,23,Lee Ewrote a review Aug 2017,"What a great hotel. I've just left and wish I was still there. Peak season, hotel full but you do not get any sense of over-crowding. Breakfast is busy, but the pool area is so extensive and there are plenty of loungers, you do not get the feeling of everyone being on top of you. It really is a great place to relax, close to some of the Algarve's most beautiful beaches. I was in room 230, where they converted my twin beds to a king straight away upon request. Bed was extremely comfortable with high-end bedding. The room itself was recently renovated and had a big screen LCD TV with plenty of channels. Nice clean bathroom and a fully equipped kitchenette, which was also newly refurbished. Big balcony with views over the pool and the sea. I loved this place. Only complaint I can make is the wi-fi is shockingly bad. Hopefully the hotel reads this and does something about it. A stay here won't disappoint!",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,4
Vila GalÃ© Tavira,Suuz V,120,Suuz Vwrote a review May 2024,"We (a 35 year old couple) stayed here for 10 days in the last two weeks of May. We had a great stay, here are our positive and negative points.It is a big and beautiful hotel. The staff is incredibly friendly. The pool is large and of perfect temperature. Not too hot, not too cold. There are more than enough sunbeds and parasols. You can order something to eat and drink at the pool, which is great. The room is spacious enough, bathroom too. You get clean towels every other day. The daily cleaning is cursory, it seems like the bed is changed every day, but they just make it again, with the same sheets. The light in the room is very minimal, just like the light on the balcony. At 00:00 all balcony lights even switch off automatically. So if you still want to sit on the balcony after noon, you have to push the floor lamp of the room in front of the door to have some light. Pity.The gym in the hotel is basic, but enough for a standard workout.Walking distance to the town is 5 minutes, so the location is perfect! Also nice is the parking garage underneath the hotel.The breakfast was spacious, but very massive and busy. There is plenty of choice, and fresh omelettes and pancakes are baked.We also noticed that we lowered the average age in this hotel by at least 30 years ;) All other hotel guests were at least 70+. Maybe it was the time of year and it is not necessarily a negative (no screaming children or loud music at the pool, but just nice and quiet), but you don't have to count on a vibrant atmosphere ;)A tip: Definitely ask for a room with a pool view! On the other sides you are on a main road, without privacy.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,4

Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Rachel D,38,Rachel Dwrote a review May 2017,"We stayed 3 nights over the long weekend. The room was comfy and even with an extra bed for my son, there was plenty of space for the three of us. The hotel shows its age in some parts, but the rooms have been updated. The staff was professional and helpful. Housekeeping came late one day (4:30 pm), but she apologized profusely for not getting to the room earlier. My husband enjoyed the gym and my son loved the pool. We did not take advantage of the breakfast, as there were cafes on the way to the metro for much cheaper. There is a grocery store two doors down where we bought water and snacks for the room. We ate at the hotel restaurant (casual pub) the first night due to our late arrival. The food was fresh and reasonably priced.  The hotel is a little far from the city center, but the 10 minute walk to the metro was not bad. There is also a city bus stop outside of the hotel. It is convenient to Casa da Musica, Serralves and Mercado Bom Sucesso. Take advantage of the complimentary Portuguese cookies and port in the lobby!",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,4

São Lourenço do Barrocal,Jake H,22,Jake Hwrote a review Sep 2018,"This is one of those places you only come across a few times in your life. The setting is genuine remarkable - an old farm that has been tastefully re-designed into a spectacular hotel with impeccable style. Just wandering the grounds is fascinating, with luxury working around the existing architecture. The pool is magic - a place to truly relax and never overly crowded. The food, much of which is grown on site, is divine. The wine made at the hotel's winery is to die for, and the staff couldn't be nicer and more authentic. If it were possible, I'd give this place 6 stars!",Sep,2018,Sep 2018,2018-09-01,2018,4
Legendary Lisboa Suites,eurotraveler32,36,eurotraveler32wrote a review Sep 2012,"This stay was our first visit to Portugal.  The hotel room was a pleasant surprise, large by european standards, with a separate room for relaxing and a kitchette that was supplied with the necessities, a suite as the name of the hotel implies.  The staff when checking in was very helpful however I wish he would have mentioned the 24 hour transportation pass for 5 euro. (We found out after spending 10 euro for the lift to go to the upper part of town.  pass covers the lift, metro, buses, trams and starts from the 1st time you use for 24 hours and can be reloaded for additional days.)   The closest metro stop was not far, Rato, and a convenient location to McDs for morning or late night lattes.   I did not give a 5 star because of the lack of free internet access in the lobby.  Most european hotels charge in the rooms but free in the lobby, only wanted to check outgoing flight and would have been 3 euro, not a huge amount, but worth noting.   Overall we would stay again as Lisbon and the Clarion are very friendly and seem to appreciate US business.",Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,4

Turim Marques Hotel,PIRwayland,27,PIRwaylandwrote a review Nov 2018,"We spent 4 nights at the Turim Marques Hotel in October, 2018. In retrospect, it was a good choice. It is a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport, close to the Marques de Pombal Metro stop and located in a nice area. It's about a 20 minute downhill walk from the hotel to Commerce Square and the Rio Tejo. We purchased 72-hour Lisboa Cards (a little more than 13 Euros per day) which gets you onto the Metro, street cars, funiculars and the train to Sintra and often didn't walk uphill back to the hotel. The staff was very helpful. The Hotel room we had was just big enough for our two suit cases. We had to watch out for the bathroom door stop in the middle of the bathroom floor – it took some effort to avoid tripping on. The hotel's breakfast wasn't to our liking but there are many places nearby to enjoy coffee and pastries. As seems typical in Portugal, the hotel doesn't have an ice machine so every night we stopped into the bar to get two glasses of ice. We were traveling with friends and the hotel was able to locate our two rooms close together.",Nov,2018,Nov 2018,2018-11-01,2018,4

Since the check-in was not yet possible (early arrival), our luggage was placed for us in a luggage room, which allowed us to look at the hotel once before.The bar area and the associated terrace require plenty of space for many guests without getting too close to the neighbouring table and making it look squeezed. The drinks menu leaves nothing to be desired and the food you can order also offers something for every taste.Breakfast...what can you say...WOW!! Since breakfast is one of the most important things for me personally, I always attach great importance to it here. Nothing is really missing!!! Starting from the warm station with various egg specialties (scrambled eggs, small fried eggs, boiled eggs), sausages and bacon to the muesli corner, which is equipped with various cereals, nuts, seeds and dried fruits.The cold cuts and cheese buffet is more than well stocked and the section with the fresh fruit was also generous.My highlight, however, was the automatic O-juice press!!Since we're not golfers, I can't comment on the facility here.There is also a small gym, which you can use at any time. Whether cardio or strength training, neither problem.Since it is located in the Boutique Hotel and not in the main building (about 2 minutes apart by car), the hotel offers flexible shuttle services here at all times.For regeneration, there is a sauna, a steam bath and a heated indoor pool.Of particular note, however, is the friendly and always helpful staff!!!We enjoyed the days there very much and are already considering making another trip there.",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,5
