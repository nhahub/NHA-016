Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Sean987,12,Sean987wrote a review Sep 2013,"We were given the studio close to the snack bar on the first floor. It was basically a high traffic area with no privacy. We literally had people peering directly in the room at times. The guy that checked us in was very rigid and unsympathetic about the fact that we were unhappy with the location.  When we asked for a manager to try to find some resolution we were told she was not in.   When we checked back the next day we had the misfortune of dealing with Carla.  She advised us the manager was still not available.  When we asked whether breakfast was included in our room she replied, \"You don't know what you paid for?\"    She said she would have the manager call us.  There was no contact about our concerns.  On the third morning we finally found someone who brought her.  We were leaving and she did not seem moved by any of our concerns either.  I was just glad to leave as I felt it was very overpriced for the poor customer service they provided.Besides the poor staff they have poorly designed bathrooms with bad ventilation, sinks that spray on the user as they are used and water that takes a long time to get hot.They have \"electronic\" safes that only operate via a large key which you have to carry around.I would not recommend this hotel, even for half of the price they are charging.  Spend your money somewhere where they at least pretend to care about customer service.",Sep,2013,Sep 2013,2013-09-01,2013,1

Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Stephen R,0,Stephen Rwrote a review Jul 2025,"No need to write much as the review by Will A from July 2025 is absolutely spot on!We (family of 4 - kids 12 and 9) preferred the quiet pool during the day and just walked down to the big pool when we fancied the slides etc. Don’t listen to the moaning reviews - it’s a good hotel and you’ll enjoy it!Having said this, we only paid £3200 for the family with on the beach. We noticed that jet2 and Tui prices were closer to £5K. I wouldn’t have been so happy if we’d paid top dollar, as I’ve stayed in much better places for that sort of money!!!",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,4

From our welcome on arrival (Madelina) we have been treated beautifully by all staff. Everyone works so hard to look after residents I can never understand any negative comments. So wish I knew all the names (Elini,Rodrigo,Goergio) you are all exceptional and thank you.

Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Jacquie M,32,Jacquie Mwrote a review Oct 2022,"Room was very clean and comfortable and the standard of housekeeping was high.  However we had paid extra to upgrade to a sea view which could only be seen by leaning over the balcony and not from the apartment.  The reception staff with a couple of exceptions weren’t particularly helpful or friendly.  The restaurant is ok, we ate there on a couple of occasions in the evening and the food was fine but again it’s not particularly welcoming.  Breakfast is more expensive than was advertised and there are additional supplements on most of the non buffet options.  The bar area is not particularly inviting.The resort is not on the beach and there are no hotel facilities on the beach.  The pools are nice but the adult pool is not easy to locate and the resort would benefit from better signage in general.  We had a big balcony which would have benefited from a couple of loungers or chairs to sunbathe in.  The bathrooms are nice but the shower fittings are poor and the only toiletries provided are soap dispensers.There are a couple of restaurants within walking distance but would recommend a car if you are staying here.This resort could be so much better with a bit more attention to detail and more welcoming staff",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Trish K,11,Trish Kwrote a review May 2017,"We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment  room number A0N. (We were woken at approx 5am every morning as there is a piece of land behind the rooms on this side that have cockerals on which start every morning around this time,although we got used to the noise sleep was still disturbed from this early time, not exactly what you want on holiday!)This was a great size with lovely balconies and views of one of the outside pools and also the sea. The two bathrooms were great for families and all the beds were comfortable. However in general the whole apartment needed redecoration the majority of the walls were badly marked just making it look tatty for the price we paid.Also the indoor pool area wasn't always the cleanest and the showers did tend to smell. The inside pool was the spa area so whilst children were allowed in this area this was for swimming only and not playing, jumping in etc.The Belmar is about half an hours walk to the town center at a slow pace with children ( we walked every day with three children aged 15, 12 and 7 yrs, I don't think you need a car unless your not used to walking at home. There was also a couple of shops within about 20 mins walk. There was no onsite shop which would have been useful, however the bar did sell snacks and ice creams. We enjoyed the holiday but don't think the apartment would tempt us back.",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,3
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Christina1010,7,Christina1010wrote a review Oct 2012,"I’m in my late 20's and went there with my sister and parents, to take a holiday somewhere different and by the beach. This place was perfect for such a situation. We just wanted to relax and that’s exactly what we did. The apartment type rooms are gorgeous and just what we needed.W enjoyed preparing meals in the room after walking up the hill to the convenience store where delicious local produce can be bought. There are two restaurants on the beach – services does take forever and the food is nothing to write home about. If you don’t feel like preparing your own meals then the hotel restaurant is pretty good and well priced or go into town.Be aware of the local taxi drivers they take about 30mintues to arrive and then rip you off and take you the long way. To get into town it literally only takes a 5 min drive if they take you the proper way. Getting back to the hotel is easy as there is a taxi rank on the main street of town.If you are looking to party then this place is not for you – it is a place to relax and enjoy life.One tip for the hotel – I wish you would have provided pool service as I would have bought food and cocktails as I spent hours in the sun.",Oct,2012,Oct 2012,2012-10-01,2012,4
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,homework110,15,homework110wrote a review May 2024,"Very clean hotel. Accommodation is apartment style with kitchen and dining area.Swimming pool as usual suitable for polar bears. So cold.We were all inclusive . What a disappointment.Break was excellent. No complaints.Lunch: Starts at 12.30 and hot food will be hot. After1.00 all hot food will be cold.Dinner: Buffet style food after it is put out will remain for the duration. Cold soup, chips, meat etc. Every so often staff member appears and stirs the rice, soup with a spoon and disappears. Maybe casts a spell to reheat the food. Interesting technique>Alcoholic drinks are local and the wine available is also of a poor quality.This is not a 4 star hotel, maybe a low 3 star.Stay anywhere but here.",May,2024,May 2024,2024-05-01,2024,3

Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,James S,0,James Swrote a review May 2025,"Ideal location to explore Lisbon, with spacious modern rooms and an idyllic private courtyard for meals &/or cocktails.Staff was very helpful setting up reservations/activities, along with the typical hotel guest needs, but really proved their mettle during the Portugal/Spain blackout that occurred during our stay...Despite the trying circumstances (& limited updates from local authorities), hotel manager Christelle and her team remained cheerful & ever-present to take care of every possible accommodation during the ~12 hours where the entire city (& beyond) was thrown back to pre-electricity times - even providing an impromptu dinner for all guests when it became clear that city restaurants would be unable to provide service that evening.Certainly an \"unforgettable\" stay - but one we'd happily re-visit due largely to the Valverde team and property.",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,4
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Kathryn G,0,Kathryn Gwrote a review Jul 2019,"In summary:PRO’s- rooms were absolutely beautiful- location good. Central and in a nice tree lined road- communal area’s really beautiful- the service in terms of arranging trips, bookings for restaurants was very good. They also managed to retrieve a jumper we left in Cascais and post it onto to us in another part of Portugal. Thank you!- the staff were all really friendlyCON’s- don’t be misled by some of the old photos on this site. The pool is not a pool and more of a water feature.- the service in the restaurant was slow and a bit sloppy. One morning my son asked for eggs and pancetta. The plate came with no pancetta and when the waiter  returned again from the kitchen to find out why he said the kitchen said they didn’t have any. Another day my son asked for scrambled eggs and pancetta and got smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. They also put each breakfast item ( beans, eggs, bacon) on separate individual saucers. This was strange- there is some building work going on directly next door. I found it  a little intrusive and could hear drilling through the walls. It was also quite noisy at breakfast",Jul,2019,Jul 2019,2019-07-01,2019,3

Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,Karen S,20,Karen Swrote a review May 2014,"My favorite hotel in the world so far! Fantastic location on top a high rock overlooking the ocean. Very comfortable, modern and clean. Every room has a wonderful view with balcony or terrace. Very friendly staff, good restaurant and fantastic breakfast. Two great pools, one outside and one indoor. Both with seaview. Lovely sauna with seaview and Turkish bath. Do try the massages. There are may different terraces with seats, sun beds, but the terrace on the roof is my favorite. There is not much to do in the village, but that is what I love about it. It is a cute little village, with only a few bars and restaurant away from the touristic craziness. The hotel offers a shuttle service to Funchal and offers different excursions. The hotel is great for people who just what to relax, but it is also a good base for day trips.",May,2014,May 2014,2014-05-01,2014,5

Luna Clube Oceano,JULIA P,14,JULIA Pwrote a review Dec 2016,"The Luna Clube hotel was a perfect choice and location for our week in Portugal. This was my first time to Portugal and I was not disappointed.  Weather great, friendly people, chilled atmosphere and stunning beaches with great views of the Atlantic from our balcony.  We were given an upgrade which was perfect.  Our room was clean, tidy and had plenty of room.  Adequate kitchen with all the essentials.  Great size bedroom with plenty of storage and very comfy beds.  All the staff from reception to the cleaners were very friendly and helpful.  Book yourself a ticket for the buffet they have in the hotel.  Plenty of food and well worth the price and with entertainment.  Entertainment not our cup of tea but it was fine and we had a very nice evening.  Nothing really to fault about the hotel.   There is a steep hill on the way back from the old town but if that is too much then there is the local train that runs every day back and forth.  Or better still walk down the beach and along into the old town which is a lot better and worth it on a beautiful sunny day.  We will be back.",Dec,2016,Dec 2016,2016-12-01,2016,4
Luna Clube Oceano,Maggie L,16,Maggie Lwrote a review Jul 2018,"Studio:Positives: friendly staff, lovely small pool area, comfortable beds, lovely bar area with reasonably priced snacksNegatives: we required a walk in shower for my husband with mobility problems, so we had the only accessible room which was a studio on the lower ground floor.  It was like being in a dungeon. There was absolutely no natural light in the room at all so always needed the lights on.Because of being below ground it was not unusual to have cockroachesThe bathroom was appalling! There was plenty of space but had not been fully utilised. There was simply a wash basin without a vanity unity or shelves. Our toothbrushes etc were kept in a carrier bag which I tied to the rail around the basin.The shower area was tiny with a seat folded against the back wall therefore making it even smaller. Again, no shelves - so shampoo, shower gel etc had to go on the floor. Water didn’t drain well so each night I was mopping the floor!The apartments on the higher floors were far superior with nice sized balconies and some with sea view.

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,YaltaPons,47,YaltaPonswrote a review Aug 2018,"We stayed 3 nights at the Tivoli as we were attending a wedding. The hotel is grand & shiny upon arrival as it has been recently refurbished, the lobby majestic & as you walk past the reception area you will come to the terrace & here you will see the most impressive sights. The coves & cliffs are incredible, this hotel sits on the perfect highest point of the carvoeira village, we even saw it from the seas perspectibe as we did a boat tour, it looked magnificent. The hotel location has one of the best views i have seen( & i have been to many incredible places), but the view i got only from the hotel bar because my rooms are another story. Upon the great welcoming from the hotel staff who are super friendly, we got the 5 star treatment from all of them so helpful at all times & always smiling, we were shown to our room a suite, after seeig thr majestic view i expected something similar or even near enougn(please note we were part of the wedding party, so we hadnt booked our room a family member did), the room number was 555 upon entry we were greeted by a slick, clean,modern suite, but dark with curtains drawn, so, when i open the curtains...wow! What a view!!! There for my amazement we were in a basement, litersry beneath a street parking lot, just below street level so cars were above me, and below me what seemed like an abandoned garage entrance, with debris & rubbish just laying outside..filth!  Our room was £240 approx a night & not a suite with a view advertised on their site. My husband went to reception to complain so that we could be moved immediately, the reception guy complied graciously without a problem, we got an alternative room with an inner garden view, not wow but an improvement 100%. This room even had a terrace, the previous one just had windows. The room was big & airy very well decorated.  Bathroom door was a tricky to open from the inside, onetime my husband had to help me get out.Wifi is pretty bad on the rooms but near the lobby area & bars its fine.The wedding was held here in the hotel & it was a memorable one, the ceremony took place at the hotels clifftop..magical.This hotel is fantastic for couples & for a relaxing holiday. Lots to do near the hotel. Beach is down the road 10 mins ,& the village is quaint & beautiful. Breakfast was fantastic 5 star. So i wouod recomend people who love the 5 star treatment to come to this hotel, the rooms have a few teething problems but the service of chambermaids & cleaniness makes up for it. I guess you have to pay more for sea views, but the inner hotel views was fine, just make sure you dont get room  555. Do visit the Skybar have a cocktail admiring the awesome view. Please see room 555 view & then the hotel bar's balcony view attached below.",Aug,2018,Aug 2018,2018-08-01,2018,5

Easy walking distance from the marina where we counted 9 different restaurants.Room - well appointed, bath robes, lovely view over the sea from our side facing sea view room.Staff - professional, friendly and well trained. The WhatsApp system for service and maintenance issues worked perfectly.Value - exceptional, especially if you book direct and get a €25 euro per day credit for food/drink. But overall drinks and food is very good value for this standard of hotel.Food - great quality breakfast and dinner in Alhambique restaurant is quality cooking with a stunning view.Facilities- gym, spa etc but the 30 metre roof top pool is stunning.Hard to find any fault with the hotel and although we don’t normally return to destinations, we will definitely come back to Saccharum",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,4

Saccharum,Diver1460,77,Diver1460wrote a review May 2017,"Had ten days here in mid May and it's a stunner - amazing architecture rightness the sea shore with views out to the Atlantic and next to a huge lavada.Rooms are great - spacious and funky. Ignore all the business about the bathroom, there is a glazed sliding door for the toilet. It's not soundproof but the design of the room makes up for it.Really nice accommodating staff and great views from all aspects. We had a side sea view room and if anything it was even better than the full view as we had the lavada and mountain views. But as they say how much time do you spend in the room - tho they had great big balconies so....We walked in to the beautiful and peaceful harbour a few minutes away and ate in the evening.  The Italian gelataria and the place next to it were brilliant - beautiful seafood, pastas and proper authentic pizzas with a salad and a bottle of wine for around 50€.The breakfast In The hotel was magnificent - a real spread of everything you could want and tables outside looking over the sea. It was a shame the tables weren't relayed when vacated - you needed to ask. Often the beautiful spread needed to be filled - bacon, eggs, still drinking water etc and it is true the tea is cold with hot milk ......couldn't quite work that out as they bring it to you when requested. Would have thought fresh hot water with a tea bag wasn't beyond the ken of man ..? I would look at this Savoy !Beautiful ( stunning in fact) infinity pool on the roof was one of its strong points - but FREEZING when we arrived and consequently empty. It did warm up as May progressed but again, with such sun around a few solar panels should give a green solution in such a new hotel.Really only picking though as staying was such a pleasure but it made the shortfalls all the more of a disappointment..On the whole, go and hope the hotel addresses the issues that everyone moans about !",May,2017,May 2017,2017-05-01,2017,3

Natura Algarve Club,gary k,109,gary kwrote a review May 2018,"Stayed here for a short break at the end of April. Staff are extremely helpful, attentive, and always had a smile! The rooms ate large, separate Kitchen, lounge etc. TV has lots of English channels for when the unpredictable Portuguese weather kicks in. Little touches like a bottle of bubbly and fruit delivered to the room on my Birthday was a nice suprise.I cannot find fault in this hotel. And for what I paid, very good value. Highly recommended.",May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,5
Pestana Viking,Magda R,1,Magda Rwrote a review Sep 2012,I booked this hotel through Lastminute.com. Seems like a lovely place to stay at. I made a booking in July for September. I am now due to travel tomorrow but found out from Lastminute that the hotel is no longer able to accommodate me. They offered me another Pestana property which I am not happy with - a great golf resort but only for those who play golf. Since Monday Lastminute have been chasing them for another solution. But no reply. So here I am leaving tomorrow and having nowhere to stay. I don't even want to know what service I would receive if I stayed there if they cannot handle a simple book out.DO NOT BOOK THERE!,Sep,2012,Sep 2012,2012-09-01,2012,1
Pestana Viking,Simon I,10,Simon Iwrote a review Oct 2022,"We stayed for a short break in October to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday.  There were 7 of us in our party and we all made good use of the facilities including the Magic Spa massage that my wife took advantage of.   Our 11 year old spent most of the time in the indoor pool with her grown-up siblings, whilst we relaxed around the pool.  I did venture into the outdoor pool once, but it was a little chilly at the end of October.   Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice.   We had 1 evening meal but ate out the other nights, but this was also on a par with other 4* buffets I've had over the years.  Overall I'd recommend this hotel.",Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,4

Hotel Dom Luis,Headabove,170,Headabovewrote a review Sep 2014,"This was always going to be a bit of a gamble; thought Elvas would be an interesting, un-touristy sort of place. Actually it was more than expected. OK, so it's a 3 star, there is no minibar fridge, no wifi. But despite a lot of re-development work going on in the first floor (which was boarded up and a lot of pneumatic drills being used during the day) at night it was peaceful. There is a school nearby, so a bit of noise and the school bells marking the end of classes seemed to go on quite late. Bed comfortable, breakfast OK and lots of it. They also have a swimming pool which they seemed to take great care over hoseing it down regularly despite the heavy rainfall... Car parked adjacent to the hotel which was free. Nice staff who will happily provide a map of the city and point out the local hostelery. Price wise, really excellent value.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,3

What a pleasant surprise when we checked into the room!  Our room with a small balcony had a beautiful view overlooking the Duoro River.  The room itself was spacious and had a very nice bed and bath but it was the view that was the best.  We took a bottle of port up to the roof of the hotel where there were several tables and chairs, and enjoyed the port as we took in the view of the river, the bridge and the city of Gaia across the way.  In the evening it is absolutely beautiful.  It is about a five minute walk down to the touristy restaurants and shops.",Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,5

Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Anth723,89,Anth723wrote a review Oct 2020,"Cons: very poor service at reception. Acres of queuing and chatting the breeze while others wait. Poor directions to an apartment far away - directed to lifts that don't even go to our floor. Very hilly. Car parking virtually impossible. Thankfully, other hotels were empty.Pros: lovely pool, nice pool bar but poorly staffed. Half the time no one was there. Rooms adequate, though it took 3 days to get someone to mend my door lock. This in itself quite inconsiderate and slow. We could have been robbed.Air con was good quality. Rooms adequately furnished for AI. Took 3 days to get towels to our room. Awful service. I think the place had just reopened cos everywhere was dirty.Good CV protocols. I felt safe. Lovely location near the beach but only a few rooms overlook the beach. In the queue was an apartment owner who could not even get a pool or sea view. Boy was he mad.Food was OK, as usual, breakfast being the best meal. For some reason, on the continent the coffee machines always premix the drinks with sugar, and the cappuccino was seriously sweet with way too much chocolate added.I had to have espresso and fresh milk.Praia de Oura is lovely but hilly, and Albufeira is beautiful in summer.I would return but probably to a different hotel.",Oct,2020,Oct 2020,2020-10-01,2020,2

Paying for the ocean-view is absolutely worth it, it is the best we've ever seen.The room is also very big and comfortable, except for the hard mattrass and occasionally loud people outside. Since we were there over Christmas, a lot of the island's restaurants were closed and we ended up eating at the hotel's restaurant more often than we planned, which was fine but has a pretty small menu and no vegan options.",Dec,2018,Dec 2018,2018-12-01,2018,4

No souvenir shops, just  lovely white washed houses, narrow cobbled streets (hilly) within the castle walls.  The hotel itself was just inside the castle gates, clean, comfortable with friendly staff.  Parking was adjacent to the hotel.  The castle looked a great place to explore but age made that impossible for us.  We did climb the ramparts to look out over the valley, with spectacular views.  It is possible to walk the perimeter, if you have a good head for heights.  There are a few eateries but touristy it is not.

Yes! Lisbon Hostel,Imran1991,15,Imran1991wrote a review Apr 2015,"It only costs around â‚¬10-12 to get a cab there from the airport, as soon as you arrive you're welcomed by nice friendly staff. You need to pay â‚¬5 deposit for your key but it's one of them that is on your arm like a watch so you can't lose it.The room i stayed in was a 6 bed mix dorm which had a really nice ensuite shower/toilet and a big drawer under the beds to keep your things inside which you should lock with your own padlock. The centre of the room was pretty spacious and there was a fire escape which you can go up or down out of the balcony too.We were on the 2nd floor so we were slightly lazy and used the lift on the odd occasion where there were signs giving you travel tips as well as advertising their dinner & pub crawl which only cost â‚¬20 altogether!The lobby was such a nice area with a double bed to relax on along with a bunch of chairs, sofas & bean bags and even a games console to play on! There were 3 Macbooks you have free access to if you need anything and kitchen & washing facilities too along with free Wifi that works perfectly in your room too.The hostel is only a 5 minute walk away from the famous Arch and you have most things nearby there so this is the best place for location.The staff were more than helpful with any query you had and when I lost my phone they called up the club I went to see if it had been handed in but sadly it wasn't so the manager gave me a free drink for my troubles which I didn't expect at all but it did cheer me up a bit.They also do a free walking tour every day at 10.30am which gives you an insight of what Lisbon has got to offer and is very informative about everything.If your travelling on your own have no worry as it's so easy to make friends here if you just go on the walking tour & pub crawl.We all liked the place so much that we decided to book Porto for September as they have another Yes! Hostel there and apparently it's even nicer than here which I find hard to compete with.",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,4
