Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Sophie,8,Sophiewrote a review Jun 2025,This hotel is amazing can't wait to return. Can't fault anything. Have serious holiday blues since coming home. Staff are so friendly. Food is so good and plenty of everything. The added bonus of two separate restaurants is great and they both are lovely. My 4 year old loved the kids club. And even got to go on stage at the evening entertainment one night which was a big hit.,Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,5
Saccharum,J&D,7,J&Dwrote a review Mar 2016,"If you want a real break this is the hotel for you. It was newly opened therefore furnishings and decor were superb. The room itself was spacious and well designed with an emphasis on lighting. Hotel staff were extremely helpful even returning my earring which I left behind by post to the UK free of charge! Spa area was lovely and the treatment I booked enjoyable.The location was a little out on a limb and hotel coach to Funchal was quite expensive with late afternoon return preventing an evening in the capital unless you used a taxi. But you achieved the feeling of \"getting away from it all\"!",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,2
Hotel Madeira,Steveyf16,12,Steveyf16wrote a review Jun 2016,"The hotel is located in an excellent position within Funchal itself. Its close to the many fantastic restaurants and bars that this beautiful city has to offer. The hotel and the staff are friendly and helpful, particularly the breakfast room staff. the rooms were cleaned daily and were more than suitable for my wife and I. Although we had a balcony room facing the municipal gardens we experienced no difficulty in sleeping as  some reviewers have commented. Indeed we were so lucky that our trip coincided with a spectacular festival with music, art, theatre and fireworks that every morning we awoke to the most fantastic singing and music.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Bozena O,47,Bozena Owrote a review Sep 2021,"We started last Tuesday and came to this beautiful hotel. We asked for cot bed for our child and it was not there so we called reception and they replaced it straight away. No problem with anything. Room was really spacious and very modern,cleaned every day. Towels change every day. Fresh bottle of still water every day. Swimming pools very very nice, for everyone. Small for kids, big for adults and two smaller in quiet place. Very clean. Food was okay. The best was Animation team, working very hard to keep everyone happy. Kids loved it. I was reading few reviews before we came here and just don’t understand how someone can complain about anything here. It’s really 5 stars hotel with everything you need here. We will be back. Fantastic holidays.",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,5
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Wolfgang S,49,Wolfgang Swrote a review Aug 2021,"Excellent Location, well furnished rooms (newly equipped and clean) , close to the beach, enough parking space …BUT one of the  wirst  service, except room service and pool bar I ever experienced … checkin was okish, got told what is not allowed… but asking for a third key the next day (we are talking an initiated plastic card!) for a party of four was a  unkind explanation that a 2-bedroom appt (EUR 2.400,-/w) has only 2 keys, asking for the key for the safe I was told not to loose it, otherwise I will need to pay the opening (…why would I get a key to a safe … to loose it???) and finally today exchanging towels after 3d I was told VERY ruthless to not put the used towels on the spa reception desk due to “hygenic” reasons but I had to sign for the new towels with a bic pen (nothing wrong with a bic pen) used by 22,000 others …The staff needs a client focused / respect training IMMEDIATELY !!! This is not Portugal’s friendliness, kindness and always helpful as we know and experienced  it many times before .. I am totally disappointed.. and treated as a bad behaving kid ..:-(",Aug,2021,Aug 2021,2021-08-01,2021,2
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Dalmation2013,31,Dalmation2013wrote a review Nov 2021,"We had stayed as a family of 4 in August and had a very good stay so decided to bring our family in October so we were a party of 10.The hotel is lovely, light and airy, with a fabulous view of the sea with a great location for restaurants and beach.We had a deluxe suite, as we had 2 children with us, they had the sofa bed.  The room is a very good size with balcony overlooking the pool and sea view.  Lovely big bathroom with glass panel and rainwater shower, fresh towels, dressing gowns, slippers, hairdryer and toiletries.  We also had a large dressing area with fitted wardrobes.  The bed was a very good size like a super king size very comfortable with good quality linens.  Beach towels are provided.Staff at breakfast were very friendly and accommodating making sure that as a party of 10 we all sat together every day.Drinks and snacks at the pool bar were very hit and miss compared with the very good service we received in August.We had lunch at the bar one day as the weather had turned very wet, we waited too long for our food to come, when it arrived it wasn’t of a good standard, 2 of our party were pregnant and had ordered the Caesar salad and the chicken was still very pink.  We did complain and straight away the manager came and spoke to us and discounted our bill.We love coming to the Tivoli and even though our visit wasn’t as perfect as we would have liked we will still visit next time we are in Carvoeiro.",Nov,2021,Nov 2021,2021-11-01,2021,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,PaulW1983,3,PaulW1983wrote a review May 2022,"The hotel is very clean and appeared to be relatively modern. The rooms were spacious and had a balcony.The food was nice although as with most all inclusive hotels it did become repetitive towards the end of our 7 night stay. The food in the a la carte restaurant was great, the Portuguese was okay but not the best. There were no issues with getting a drink or queues for food.The only real negative for us was that we were travelling with a 2 year old and found the meal times to be slightly later than we would have liked for a family hotel. Breakfast started from 7.30am and dinner was 7pm.Also at this time of year the freshwater pools were very cold and not many people were using them.In all this is a good family hotel, the staff are very helpful and we would recommend it.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,4
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Carmen S,134,Carmen Swrote a review Jul 2015,"We were two mature couples and rented a two-bedroom apartment in the resort. The bedrooms are light and large, each with a bathroom, the living room is large and comfortable, the kitchen is perfectly equipped with all one may need. The resort has several pools and is at walking distance of the sea side; unfortunately water of the ocean is very cold and bath is not possible for most of the people. People wishing to stay in Lagos city-center may be disappointed as the resort is far away of the center, located in a neighborhood close to the sea. The staff is kind and speak good English, the apartment is elegant and very comfortable and we definitely want to return.",Jul,2015,Jul 2015,2015-07-01,2015,2
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,NJW69,16,NJW69wrote a review Oct 2022,Really enjoyed my stay. Love Carvoeiro and have been coming for 10 years. I booked here as a treat but I’m not sure that it delivered an experience that was three times better than the usual hotel I stay at. Me and two other friends stayed at the 4* in July and it cost less for the three of us than I paid on my own. €2000 for a weeks b&b is quite a lot. I do stay in other 5* hotels and the differential between 4* and 5* is not usually so big. Food was lovely but I thought €5.50 for a litre bottle of water by the pool was a bit much. Saying that I would probably go back.,Oct,2022,Oct 2022,2022-10-01,2022,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,Tomislav Dzanak,0,Tomislav Dzanakwrote a review Sep 2025,"Pros: Lovely staff, good room, solid food options and overall good service.Cons: Swimming pools were freezing cold, cocktails were very artificial and too sweet, also we never had the option of All Inclusive+ so felt like 2nd class citizens most of our stay.Lovely hotel, would recommend it, but possibly in hot months (July/August) due to very cold swimming pools, and not a cocktail destination (big fan and lover of cocktails here).Otherwise well run, good service options and lovely staff.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,4

Thank you for reserving our table on our last evening with us asking and the additional shrimp!! Good loaction for going out walking and right next to the Santo do Serra championship golf course which has stunning views over the peninsular.

Nice indoor pool which has sliding doors to bring the outside in, it also has an awesome jacuzzi massage set into the side wall. We'll definately be back.",Sep,2014,Sep 2014,2014-09-01,2014,5
A Casa Formosa,atomcat,145,atomcatwrote a review Jun 2014,"Joao's directions from the bus station to the apartment were spot on - fabulous! The apartment is spacious, quiet & clean...note that it is on the second floor & there isn't an elevator. Outdoor area for sun lovers. A simple breakfast + access to the kitchen at any time is an added bonus. Centrally located - close to Bolhao Market, Santa Catarina shopping precinct in one direction & within walking distance to San Bento train station, Ribeira in the other. Most importantly, being able to converse with Joao in English made our stay just that little bit more personal. And Joao was a mine of information about restaurants & places to go. The shops around the apartment itself are delightful (sadly I didn't have the opportunity to investigate them in depth) & the pastel de nata from Café Comodoro below the apartment are delicious.",Jun,2014,Jun 2014,2014-06-01,2014,4
"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",James B,65,James Bwrote a review Oct 2021,"I hadn't really done much research on this place; I was expecting a nice luxury hotel.  However I realized upon driving in that this place is very large, and along with a hotel the property includes individually owned residences, timeshares, a golf course, lots of pools and restaurants along with a health club, salon, and shops.  But the second and better surprise was that the resort is truly on a cliff beneath which (reached by elevator) is a magnificent beach .  I would have felt more comfortable at a smaller place, but we really enjoyed spending a day walking, swimming, and soaking up sun on the beach.  Great views of the red rock cliffs looking from the water back up to the resort.",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,DJH,73,DJHwrote a review Aug 2016,"In the decades in which the English visit the Algarve area hasn't been developing to a holiday spot with class, style and good Hygene. The local authorities aren't active enough in maintaining a standard that acknowledges the value of the natural treasures along the coast line.In Albufeira streets, garbage, sanitary facilities are not what you may expect although the old city center offers a variety of culinary entertainment. All the restaurants try hard to get you in as a guest and also try hard to make you happy wit the served food. Prices for a complete dinner are low; for approx. 15-20 euro's you have a 3-course dinner of good quality and if you look for it hard enough, the view can be very nice. Restaurants at 'The Strip' in the newer part of town are also varied, but the surroundings are even more filthy than the old center. Nevertheless you can find a nice place at the beach of Praia de Oura walking down from 'The Strip'Appartmenthotel Forte Do Vale is situated about a kilometer outside of the old center of Albufeira and about a half kilometer to the other side to 'The Strip'. Forte Do Vale is a five-star hotel, most likely based on all the extra's that are offered. The quality of the service and condition of the premises are definitely not on that level. The outside swimming pool area is ok, the gym and the inside swimming area is outdated, fountains in the hallway and outside are out of order frequently, the outside of the hotel crumbles down on some parts and needs a paint job, the food in the restaurant does not equal that of the restaurants in the city center. The breakfast is an English one, of poor quality and the same every morning. Not my cup of tea...The rooms are ok in size and facilities. They are clean but cheaply furnished and not like a five-star place. Cleaning is done every day although the let you know that it's an alternating frequency every two days. Service at the desk is fine and on an acceptable level. Their English is fine and they are helpfull en polite.When choosing Forte Do Vale my advice is to not expect a five-star hotel, but a good to average appartement hotel, be satisfied with 'good', don't expect very good food and facilities. In my opinion Forte Do Vale is nice but there really are much nicer places and locations to stay at Algarve.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,2

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Christine N,46,Christine Nwrote a review Jun 2016,"We have been going to Portugal for 30 years but this was our first time at this hotel. I agree with other reviews, the apartment was spacious and spotless. Fresh towels every day. Lovely features in public areas of hotel. We didn't use the restaurant so I can't comment on that. We had a drink in the bar the first night when there was entertainment on, but to be honest the guy singing was not that good. We found the bar closing early at about 11pm strange for such a hotel.Pool area good but it should be cleaned before guests go down to use the area. Not much fun when pool attendant has hose pipe around your sunbed. We enjoyed our stay and would visit again, although I do think MGM need to rethink allowing stag/hen do's into hotels that are family orientated. There must be plenty of other hotels for these groups to use then MGM can keep up their standards. We are back in August but staying at Club Priara da Oura, but we will stay at Forte Do Vale again.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4
Valverde Lisboa Hotel & Garden - Relais & Châteaux,Johnny Portugal,48,Johnny Portugalwrote a review Jul 2025,"I recommended this hotel to some friends who are staying in Lisbon for two nights and wanted to stay in the same neighborhood where I lived. The Hotel‘s location is fantastic as it is right on the ”Champs-Élysées” of Lisbon, the Avenida Liberdade.When they arrived, they were greeted and helped with their luggage and assisted to their room after check-in.  Very great service.  The hotel staff was very accommodating with any questions that they had about the local area.  Upon checkout, they received the same professional kindness, and assistance that they did checking in.The only negative thing they told me about the hotel was problems with the air conditioning.  But they did say it was a great day and they would stay there again, so I feel comfortable recommending it to other others if given the opportunity.",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,4

The staff are very friendly and helpful and the shuttle bus to funchal (the capital) and riberia brava is very good. the hotel offers free transfers to and from the airport if you stay for 7 days (i think this has to be booked in advance). i will be returning here again next year.

Four Seasons Fairways,Pink S,47,Pink Swrote a review Aug 2016,"Unlike most reviews here, I am not an owner in this resort.In all quinta, beach is beautifull, but no hotel has direct beach access. More than 1km from Fairways.Positive:Ok resort, clean, nice environment.Private  barbecue on the terrasse.Look for positives in other reviews, most of it is true.Negative:Nobody mentions this, but this is near the airport and quite noisy.There are individual swimming pools in each bungalow, but very tiny and basically unusable. It would be much better to have spent that money in better shared pools.Overall resort is getting old, maintenance is not the best.Kids club is very expensive.Breakfast in the restaurant is extreme weak and I mean like there is only toast bread, butter, industrial strawberry jam and that's it.

Independente Principe Real,Josefine L,5,Josefine Lwrote a review Feb 2016,"The Independente is one of those places that makes you genuinly happy! The staff is super friendly and they all speak very good English. The decor of the place is cool in an unpolished and retro way. We stayed in suite 4, a very spacious room with a wonderful little terrace. An amazing view from both the room's terrace and the breakfast place.The breakfast is by the way perfect - that ham and those scrambled eggs were to die for! And Lourdes - you are such a sweetheart, always smiling and making everyone feel like we were coming to your own home for breakfast!Reading reviews only thing which was worrying me a bit was the noise and the smell from the bathroom. Well, at least in the suite we had, there was nothing of the noise at all, and I would know because I'm a light sleeper. And the smell - well, it's a really old building, it's normal, and it wasn't that bad. One just needed to keep the bathroom door closed in between.Congratulations to the Independente for being able to create such a friendly and relaxed atmosphere!",Feb,2016,Feb 2016,2016-02-01,2016,4

Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Daisy1234567,44,Daisy1234567wrote a review Oct 2014,"We booked this hotel as a 4* , I think it's more of a 4*+ . Where do I start , it was great value , hotel had a lovely feel to it with water features and a miniture grand piano in the reception with pianist at certain times . It had a bar with entertainment , resturant with themed evenings for variety . The pool was maintained to a good standard , with a pool bar , whenever I went to the pool I could always get a lounger ( a couple of people still felt the need to reserve theirs though!) our room was clean and spacious with maid daily . It overlooked the mini island and the pool you could also see the sea close by over a couple of roof tops which helped give it a tranquil feel . It was nice to sit on the balcony and watch the pool activity (which wasn't rowdy ) and the comings and goings of the little roundabout . Once in the room with the patio doors & the curtains shut , it blocked out any light and noise . The hotel is part of MGM group with sister hotels and a free open top double decker bus was provided every 15mins to the other hotels so activies and entertainment could be took full advantage of . It also did return trips to the strip and old town at set times . If the free bus times didn't suit ,the tourist road train had one of its 4 stops right outside the hotel which was €4 for the day or€2:50 for one trip . The other stops were the old town , the strip and the shopping center it also run late at night . If I was to find a negative it would be that there was a slight pong of drains out the front of the hotel and the beds were a little hard this is a personal preference though as my husband had the best nights sleep his ever had whilst away . The negatives arnt a big issue & wouldn't stop me  staying again.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4

Royal Savoy Hotel,hebridesferryman,80,hebridesferrymanwrote a review Dec 2011,"My wife and I spent two weeks at this resort in November in a studio apartment, and were delighted on just about every level.The resort is situated ideally.  It stands adjacent to the sea yet within an easy walk of Funchal town centre, and it appears that all rooms are sea facing across delightful gardens and swimming pools.    We were allocated a room on the second floor, but I am convinced that a room virtually anywhere would prove to be more than acceptable.We found the staff to be pleasant and graceful in every department, and the cost and standard of food and drinks when purchased carefully to be more than fair for a five star establishment.Sadly, we detected that the hotel services such as restaurant and bars were not well patronised, and this puzzled us, for we thought that the management were trying very hard to deliver value to their customers by selling various discounted meal packages and the like, in addition to extended 'happy hours'  in all the bar outlets.If I was a timeshare owner at this resort, I would be very concerned that in not supporting the useage of these outstanding facilities, the management might conclude it not worthwhile to keep them operating at that level of excellence.In other words be careful - 'use it or lose it' !The interior public areas and furnishings are truly delightful - comfortable and relaxing decor and interesting artwork around every corner, and so given the opportunity, we would not hesitate to return to this resort.We see only two minor negatives...1. The Old Savoy Hotel gardens.   Its sad to see them behind locked gates, clearly going to seed.   Although the gardens do not in any way detract from the excellence of the Royal Savoy  Resort , we hope the rebuild of that famous old hotel and reinstatement of the gardens will not be long delayed.2. Strangely, we found all the room towels to be a little thin, and not in tune with the excellence of the other room linens and  so on.This resort is excellent, and deserves its five star rating, and we would say well done to all the management and staff.",Dec,2011,Dec 2011,2011-12-01,2011,4

Having never been to this area previously and now with a little one in tow I accepted an invitation to stay for a week.The hotel was easy to find from the airport and took about 45mins using the toll road (not sure how long it would take on the old road but at a guess probably double if busy). The approach down to the hill opens up the hotel and it's magnificent setting. On a cliff top overlooking the sea with a short stroll down to a sheltered beach.The hotel staff were pleasant although did threaten to charge me 15 euro/night for a cot which I was not going to accept in a 4* hotel having previously noted them of my requirements. The domestic staff were always polite as were all others I encountered.The hotel has all facilities needed including indoor heated pool (suitable for 10 month baby), outdoor pool with child pool (I tried neither as a bit nippy), small token gym (usable but basic), jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, children's room, and spa (a little pricy). I was self catering so did not try hotel food but restaurants looked pleasant enough. I prefer to either go out or else provide own breakfast in comfort of room.The room itself was fine with fantastic views over the pools and sea (6th floor). I guess the only gripe would be the slightly dated technology in the room and the smell of the drains in the shower room adjacent to lounge area. This could however just be unique to my room (635) and should have mentioned it to front desk but just never got round to it. The small kitchenette, which although basic, was adequate.I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing stay cation as it was very quiet and family orientated although would also be fine for a couple wanting some quiet time (obviously talking about this time of year, no doubt summer is manic).There are plenty of restaurants in the nearby village/town which we ventured to most evenings but did drive as just beyond comfortable walking distance. I would certainly recommend a car if planning to go slightly further afield than 15/20 mins walk.",Apr,2014,Apr 2014,2014-04-01,2014,4

Hotel Gat Rossio,ams_guy,11,ams_guywrote a review Jun 2010,"I stayed at the Hotel Gat Rossi for 4 nights. The hotel is in a great location and a few minutes walk from the airport bus stop. Although the room was small, it was very comfortable and I liked the ambient lighting. Breakfast was plentiful and I enjoyed eating outside in the fresh air on the terass. A nice touch was the ice machine.The staff are very knowlegeable about good restaurants to visit.For some people, the lack of space to hang clothes may be a problem. For me, it was summer and I was wearing t-shirts.I would certainly go back here.",Jun,2010,Jun 2010,2010-06-01,2010,4
Palacete Real Companhia do Cacau,Maria Conceição Mota,2,Maria Conceição Motawrote a review Jun 2016,"In a beautiful place, that took us back in time, we were able to share some of the family treasures as if were part of the family. every thing has a refine sophisticated touch enhanced by quality, from the bed linen to the food, where one can taste the local fresh produce. the risotto with aubergine is a must, and the chocolate mousse...absolutely divine. the staff are very friendly while discrete and the owners really its as they hosting very good friends. the décor contrast between newly done and the old, represents well the good taste of the owners.it is not a chain type hotel with a 24 hour service but rather a friends house where we can sit by and in the fireplace, while enjoying a good conversation after and excellent meal on a lengthy dinning table,I must now return to try the chocolates made in their factory that have opened since my stay.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,5

Altis BelÃ©m Hotel & Spa,Richard B,0,Richard Bwrote a review Jun 2017,"Our Family spent 3 days and 2 nights in Lisbon during our summer vacation this year! We chose this SPG property because of its proximity to the River and we were thrilled with this choice. The Altis Belem is simply outstanding! I think it is the only Hotel in Lisbon actually on the river! The views from the rooms are amazing . The Hotel location is within walking distance of several of the top 10 historical sites in Lisbon ..including Belem Tower and Jeronimos Monastery of of course the famous Pasteis de Belem! The service exceeded all expectations and the Hotel Dining experince was amazing! The outdoor bar/lounge along the Rivers edge was a fantastic place to people watch ,relax , and take in Lisbon's beautiful weather! But the contemporary rooms here were jaw dropping cool! I would recommend this Hotel to anyone traveling to Lisbon ! You will not regret it!!",Jun,2017,Jun 2017,2017-06-01,2017,5
Casa da Tita,Nuria B,16,Nuria Bwrote a review Aug 2024,"We discovered this casual accommodation online looking for different accommodation options outside of agglomerations and resorts in Algarve and the truth could not be better our choice.Casa da Tita is located in Nave do Barao about 30 minutes drive from attractions such as Villamoura or Albufeira and its beaches. Tavira about 45 min.It has 3 bedrooms and two apartments. Breakfast area, swimming pool with hammocks and jacuzzi area, highly recommended.We stayed in the pink room and liked it very much. The bed was very comfortable and united having no more noises than the rooster crowing at dawn rest is guaranteed.Breakfast is very complete; coffees, infusions and natural juice, scones and cereals, yogurts, orchard fruit, eggs, variety of breads and cold cuts, homemade jams made by Joaquin, fresh cheese goat cheese...We did not do any activities but have different options such as making liquors, visiting cheese shops, aromatic plants, excursions ... options not to be bored in case you do not want to leave the area.If you are looking for a quiet place full of peace, disconnection, tranquility and with a hospitality of 10 this accommodation is an extraordinary option provided you do not mind taking the car as it is essential in this place.Thank you very much Miguel and Joaquin for your extraordinary attention and treatment throughout our stay. For being aware that everything was to our liking and for offering us an experience of 10 making us feel at home.We will meet again!!!",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,5
Porto PalÃ¡cio Hotel by The Editory,Tripordie,29,Tripordiewrote a review Aug 2011,"I stayed here on a short business trip and was very impressed overall. This is a classic corporate hotel where you find it difficult to really find any faults. I would assume is at minimum some 10-15 years old and as such they have kept it very well. Very friendly staff, clean fresh rooms with great views of town, good location if you have overall business to do in old and newer Porto. The rooms have free internet and I particularly liked the beds with soft fresh smelling sheets and perfectly sized pillows for sleeping purposes. Bathroom light and easy to manoeuvre in, good enough for 2. Shower head big but they need to clean the holes so that water comes out in generous quantities rather than thin, almost vapourized format, its not a steam room you know. Toilet separate with a bide' for all day long cleanliness. The chocolate on the pillow was Magnum which I thought only came in ice cream format (good idea it wasn't an ice cream though), what a treat. Expensive mini bar though in an otherwise very good value for money 5 star hotel (I guess they make the money here?). The breakfast was really good and worthwhile having even if you don't stay here. Possibly the only downer is the location down at minus 1 level with no windows so you have nothing to look at other than fellow guests and fortunately for me there were some good looking ones immersed in their pancakes, fruit salads and morning papers. Oh yes, the papers were good too by the way but I would suggest the hotel moving the breakfast up to top floor with 360 views of Porto. The top floor is reserved for VIP guests and seemed deserted when I visited so maybe try breakfasts for all there and VIP stuff the rest of the day? This would maximise the guest experience for more guests. Anyway. I eat at 2 of their restaurants and would ignore the italian next time but gladly re-visit the Japanese. The food was delicious and the place full of guests with a good vibe (the italian was deserted). I cannot fault much here and would easily return next time in Porto. Well done.",Aug,2011,Aug 2011,2011-08-01,2011,4

Aim for one at higher floors and far from the elevator and you will be fine. Breakfast could have had more options or at least some variety. Not in the most spectacular area of Lisbon, but extremely close to a metro station, so everything is in reach.

Hotel Albergaria Dias,Novaterras,25,Novaterraswrote a review May 2009,"We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were disappointed.First of all , it is NOT a 4 Star hotel by any means. It is clean and the staff are friendly and efficient , but it is a 3 star at best. Our room (101) was pretty basic and the balcony sits above the start of the alleyway , which makes it very  \"public\" , so avoid it if you can.If a view is important to you , avoid the first floor as there are no \" views\" from it. I would think the best views would come from rooms 306-311 and perhaps the higher numbers on floor two.                                                                                                                                                   The dining room can be \"congested\" as it's not all that big, with tables very close together .The AD only does breakfast and we found them repetitive and boring. All that changes on the menu are the eggs , which range from fried to scrambled to omellette style on a daily basis and they come with bacon and creppes.  .The rest is made up of cereals (2) fruit ( good quality) ham, cheese, bread and rolls, with of course juices etc. Not very inspiring I'm afraid.The swimming pool sits in an area no bigger than a large garden and if you are the self-conscious type ...you won't like it. It was hardly used when we were there as the water was very cold. The loungers we found uncomfortable .There is a fitness area , but when you take the age of the average guest when we were there, they should consider turning it into a reading room or card room , as there is nowhwere like this ,in the hotel, to sit. We never saw anyone use the equipment on offer.The alleyway ( which is vital as you'd never climb the front of hotel \"hill\" on a regular basis) was  being \"re-constructed \" when we were there and resembled Beirut Main Street after an air-strike....very messy and required careful walking!!  I should also point out that Engineers with theodilites carried out a full day survey on the gardens and run down property to the right of the alleyway....so something in the way of construction , may be on the horizon....beware!!We ate at the nearby restaurants and tried five different ones.The best, by far , in our opinion was the Estrela do Mar which is last one on the right of the group. Ask for their Stroganoff ...great value for money.To avoid being \"hassled \" ( in a nice way) by the restaurant \"doormen\" .........when you come out of the gate at the back of the AD, turn immediately to the right and go down that street and this brings you to the back door of the restaurants , where you can enter . Our average meal cost , with moderate drinks , was 20 Euros each.Recommend you buy a combi-ticket for the Cable Car and Monte Palace gardens...great trip. Recommend you get the 29 or 31 local bus and make your own way to Botanical Gardens ...total cost 5 euros each, round trip...great day.Recommend you do the Island tours ( West/East/ Nun's Valley) . Quite expensive ...but worth it. We booked with our Thomson rep. and they laid on a quality coach, excellent guide, lovely restaurants and very good lunches. The trips were very informative and have some great 'photo opportunities.We also did the \"time-share\" visit via. Thomson.... very professionally done with no pressure whatsoever.We didn't buy ( nearly did)...but we got a beautiful book on Madeira and 40 Euros \"cash-back\" ..just for going. You could do worse!!Sorry if our thoughts on the hotel clash with yours , but it's all about opinions, and whilst we would not criticise the hotel per. se , it's just not as good as we were led to believe.",May,2009,May 2009,2009-05-01,2009,2
