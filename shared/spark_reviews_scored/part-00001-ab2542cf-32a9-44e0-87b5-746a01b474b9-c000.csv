Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,aquatiki,235,aquatikiwrote a review Nov 2023,"We discovered this hotel in 2020 while walking on the beach. It seemed to us to be of quality. It's much better still. Flawless welcome, just don't arrive before 3 p.m. to get the room. Comfortable room with sea view It's perfect. Breakfast of very high quality, whether it's the service or the catering. In short, a perfect agreement",Nov,2023,Nov 2023,2023-11-01,2023,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,He D,0,He Dwrote a review Jun 2024,"A lovely hotel with everything needed for a great family holiday. The staff are friendly and work extremely hard,they are a credit to this hotel in everyway. I Would of loved another week here. My boys loved it especially the soccer games. They loved the freedom of getting their own drinks,icecream etc.Pools were great, cold but once in it was grand and im sure in the weeks ahead when the real hot weather hits the temperature will be perfect. I thought the food was great especially for my younger son who's so fussy, his diet was way better out here than back home, ate loads of fish, rice ,fruit etc, to be honest I couldn't get over all the food so much of it and always something available to eat every hour of the day. Loved the coffee machine thought the cappuccinos tasted so good and boys loved getting the hot chocolate out of them. Would definitely come back here again, maybe next year.",Jun,2024,Jun 2024,2024-06-01,2024,5
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,newirishuser,3,newirishuserwrote a review Sep 2023,"Just back from a week staying in this hotel. Family of 4, children aged 12&10. We had a great time, hotel was clean, great selection of food, albeit it was a bit cold, but salads, dessert and fruits where great.Snack bar by pool was great, found the food to be fresh despite other reviews. Swim up bar was great for the kids to get drinks, especially the strawberry slushie👍🏻. Kids entertainment was good during the day, kids enjoyed playing footie in the astro beside the pool. teens room with pool table etc was great to entertain older kids in the evening. Pity Friday is packed with entertainment at pool, would be good if it could be spread out over the week, due to our arrival and departure time we missed the foam party, which only happens on a Friday afternoon.Alcreim al a carte restaurant was great, kids both got steaks at no additional charge. Other al a carte restaurant was not to our liking, but if you are a real meat lover it’s for you.Great shuttle service to old town, but download the Uber app as bus can get full and Uber will arrive in a couple of mins and is cheap.Room was noisy at night from the bar across the road, who played music in speakers outside.Overall a very enjoyable stay",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,4

Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Jackson9305,212,Jackson9305wrote a review Nov 2020,"We were thoroughly pleased with our stay here. On the advice of a TA report, when we checked in, I asked for a room on a higher floor. As they were not booked out, we got one on the fifth floor and facing east, which afforded a perfect view of the beautiful cliff and tiny beach.Don’t even think about saving money by reserving a less expensive room; this place is all about the location – splurge on a sea view room. Even just waking up to the ocean view is worth the higher rate.I can’t understand the negative ratings from the summer; all was working well in September, having gotten set up with the Covid-19 regulations. All of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The few minor problems we had in the room were taken care of very quickly using the request form on the hotel app. Special mention to Riccardo who was always upbeat; he helped us with our luggage and gave us some travel tips to boot.The hotel address was not on our rental car GPS, and it’s a bit tricky to find if you’re unfamiliar with the area. Coming from the highway, head down to Carvoeiro Beach, and at the end of the street by the beach, make the u-turn back up, then take the first right. The hotel is about a kilometer uphill from the beach. There is plenty of free parking on the premises.We had half board with meals in the buffet restaurant. The food was of good quality, although it was strenuous and took usually a while as you had to stand in a queue for your food (wearing a mask) because the staff served the portions. Coffee and tea is available in the room and replaced daily; there are minibar items to purchase. Our superior room was nicely decorated in white and grey, with good lighting. The fitness room has several endurance machines, a Smith machine, and a selection of dumbbells. There is a small indoor heated pool; the mail pool outside is not heated. The Sky Bar is not to be missed. Evidently the hotel is very popular with British guests.There are a lot of restaurants along the street down to the beach so if you don’t get half board, and are willing to walk a bit, you will find plenty of places to eat at.Report within report of The One restaurant at the hotel:Since we had half board and found out that we could get credit towards a meal at their The One restaurant, we were glad to have a chance for a proper sit-down meal after several days of standing in line and wearing a face mask at the buffet. They deducted €25 per person from the tab (well actually they forgot, but corrected this at checkout when I pointed it out). The service that night was relatively slow even though not all the tables were taken when we arrived.All of our dishes were presented quite beautifully. However most of them somehow lacked pizazz, meaning the flavors were more on the ordinary side, and the portions were not particularly large. In general we were not overly impressed, and in combination with the higher prices, would not necessarily recommend it as the ultimate dining experience.",Nov,2020,Nov 2020,2020-11-01,2020,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,Wendy R,57,Wendy Rwrote a review Sep 2021,"We stayed at the Tivoli from September 4th for 2 weeks and once again we absolutely LOVED it - From the time we walked into the Reception and were met by Katerina, Marie, Juliet, Rui and Marcus and Helen it was like coming home !! They  were all so very helpful and helped me with the mountain of paperwork needed for passage both in and out of Portugal.The Breakfast buffet was lovely and we always had a lovely table overlooking the sea thanks to Maria, Danielle and Carina. We ate out at night but there was a really good choice of tavernas and restaurants within a 5 minute walk from the hotel and if we wanted to go into Carvoeira a taxi was with us within minutes.Everything about this hotel was perfect for us, the pool was lovely, no problem getting sunloungers and our coffees and beers served on our loungers made it ideal !!!The Staff cannot do enough for you and all I can say is roll on July 2022 when we will be there again.Wendy and Brian Robinson",Sep,2021,Sep 2021,2021-09-01,2021,5
Hotel Madeira,Nixynic,99,Nixynicwrote a review Sep 2025,"Me & my Husband had our Honeymoon in Funchal and we stayed at Hotel Madeira, upon arrival at approx 9pm on a Friday night we were greeted by 2 very friendly guys on reception, they were very welcoming and explained everything to us and checking us in quickly.  The hotel is located very central so you have easy access to all parts of Funchal.  We found our room to be a bit on the small side but for us 2 it was fine (we would of liked a bigger balcony - only downside), the room was very clean and it was cleaned everyday, unless we advised the maids otherwise.  Breakfast was very nice, continental but they also had a small variety of hot food.  The roof terrace pool was very clean.  Service was also spot on.  There is some building work going on nearby so you could hear the noise, but to be fair that didnt bother me.  All in all the hotel was very well kept.  I do have to say a special shout out to the 2 young men who did check us in on arrival, they did answer all of our questions, we wanted to get a taxi for a local fishing village and they advised us the best way to do this and also the cheapest, they are an asset to the hotel.  We will definitely return to Funchal and we will also stay at Hotel Madeira.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,4

Seriously the bedroom is 30m² and the lounge must be 35m².The interior of the hotel has a slight Moroccan feel to it. Very luxurious.The breakfast was a higher quality than standard.Great location, 10 mins to the Strip and 15mins walk to the main town. Bus stop right outside the back entrance and a play park for the kids opposite.Can't fault this hotel, will defo come back here in the future.",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,5

"Pine Cliffs Ocean Suites, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa",Adam C,5,Adam Cwrote a review Aug 2016,"We stayed here in the middle of July for 3 nights as a family.  The suite was lovely with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, lounge, kitchen and a large bedroom with very comfortable beds. It is a very large resort and difficult to find your way around, the cliffs are very dramatic down to the beach which is beautiful.  However the beds are packed together like sardines in a very small space making it feel claustrophobic.There is a huge choice of restaurants but you have to be very organised and book days in advance as everywhere was booked when we got there. The gym was excellent and the staff first class and knowledgeable.  My biggest issue was paying for wifi, we paid nearly 1000 euros a night and then an extra 10 a day for wifi which seems miserly.  We were also charged 1.50 euro for a banana for my young son which seems petty (everyone else took them from breakfast).  Whilst I did enjoy Pine Cliffs I will not return as I found it over priced and over busy.",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,2
Grand Muthu Forte Do Vale,Scott F,9,Scott Fwrote a review Oct 2018,"Just returned from a week AI at Forte Do Vale and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff were excellent and very attentive at all times, from the reception to the bar staff, dining area and the cleaners. The accommodation, 1 bedroom deluxe apartment, was excellent with loads of room for the 4 of us and, although we never used what was available, it even had a kitchen complete with dishwasher, washing machine, tumble dryer, etc.I'll be honest, the food was maybe a little light on selection but there was always something to pick from, either soup, main courses, salad or sweet.The pool area was also excellent although I'll qualify that by saying it wasn't too busy and we had no problem getting sunbeds, etc.Reading other reviews regarding loud music, etc I can honestly say we had no problem from that point of view. A little quiet music was played when the pool bar was open.... nothing out of order at all.Thanks for a great stay",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,4

Casas do Porto - Ribeira Apartments,Danil R,0,Danil Rwrote a review Sep 2017,"The apartment is superb and if you are visiting Porto, strongly suggest for you to stay here. The quality of the furniture is simply amazing, I would actually compare it to a hotel suite in a 5 star hotel. The location could not be more central, you walk 5m to the right of the apartment and you are by the river and the Luis bridge where you can cross and visit the caves of Porto wine. You walk 5m to the left and you are in Rua Flores where the night life and the restaurants are always buzzing. Lastly, the hosts were very professional and knowledgeable and very proud \"Porto\" people so they went above and beyond with suggestions from best restaurants to go to, all the way to the key shopping areas and best tourist routes. I would not hesitate in staying at these apartments whenever I visit Porto again!",Sep,2017,Sep 2017,2017-09-01,2017,5

He set up an amazing private tour with Gustavo to the town of Sintra and the coastline nearby.

"Reid's Palace, A Belmond Hotel, Madeira",skurf,78,skurfwrote a review Aug 2025,"It is our fifth Belmond resort to visit after Splendido, Cipriani, Sant'andrea and the Orient Express.We had high expectations as the resort is well known as well as the highland Madeira.We had organized a transfer through the package Discover Madeira and arrived smoothly to the hotel. Unfortunately we could not have early check in (in our package but upon availability) so we went to the pool for a lunch.We had a beautiful room 960 with a splendid panoramic view on the sea. We recommend old building which has more charm.What makes this resort amazing is the access to the ocean with beautiful setting and beach service (you can also rent free of charge kayak). All the staff at the beach were professional (all young people well managed by more senior manager) and helpful to find some space as the place is tiny on the rocks.We had massage at the Spa which was of high quality.Breakfast had high level of service, though as the hotel was full some dishes were not replaced for example there were short of cherries and strawberries at the breakfast during the week we stayed.We tried all the restaurants and enjoyed it: Brisa do mar has beautiful view as well as the bar and food was delicious. William starred Michelin was also a nice experience. And Cipriani did not fell short of delivering quality food with again beautiful view. We celebrated during the dinner my friend's birthday and the chef prepared a nice lemon cake for the occasion. All the evening went perfectly well and we could speak italian with one of the waiter who was from Italy.The concierge helped us to organize a trip for hiking in the mountains which was worth it as well as booking restaurants outside the hotel.The staff was professional and helpful during all the stay. We also appreciated to be invited to the GM evening cocktail and my friend had nice bottle of prosecco for his birthday delivered to the room.We missed though some entertainment in the evening as in other Belmonds we used to have a pianist playing after dinner.We could benefit from late check out, we had the room till 3 pm which is quite exceptional.Overall we recommend this hotel for the setting, the level of service and the quality of the food served in the restaurants, it is also very affordable compared to other Belmonds in Europe.",Aug,2025,Aug 2025,2025-08-01,2025,4
Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,dilfidanoglu,0,dilfidanogluwrote a review Oct 2018,"My friends and I stayed one week in the Lagos surf hostel and came back home with a lot of great memories.The hostel is very big, has a pool and a comfy living room. The hostel provides breakfast and a small lunch (sandwiches) and if you want you can cook your own meals. Every three days there's an event where you have a bbq for example or go out and eat together with other guests of the hostel. Also, there is a \"play room\" where you can play ping pong and listen to music. The pool was a great way to relax after surfing.The beds are clean and comfy. We even had our own bathroom inside our room. The people working in the hostel are extremely friendly and outgoing. Furthermore, the hostel is only a three minute walk to a supermarket (Aldi) and 15min from the old town.I would strongly recommend this hostel to anyone who is looking for a comfy, fun and chill stay in lagos.I will definitely revisit the hostel!",Oct,2018,Oct 2018,2018-10-01,2018,5
Vila Galé Albacora,Bwyta,22,Bwytawrote a review Jun 2025,"Very nice hotel with a terraced cottages & garden layout. Cottages have usual layout of bathroom with walk-in shower and  bedroom with 2 large beds, desk and chairs and outside patio area with table and chairs. Cottage floors are traditional hard ceramic tiles and room has efficient air conn unit and rooms were servced daily. Outside, the cottages have rambling flowers and cobbled-stoned walkways with well managed lawns and gardens full of flowers. A number of historical buildings remain onsite and are open and very interesting. Pool is clean and a good size (1.25m deep) with plenty of space for loungers there is also a shaded cafe/bar serving drinks and lunches. Main restaurant is very pleaeant with plenty of choice and variety, while the main bar is a nice relaxed room with excellent, experienced bar staff. All staff were very happy and helpful, cleanliness of all areas was excellent. The hotel is in an isolated coastal location away from all other facilities with secluded coastal beach walks and amazing variety of birds and salt lagoons. We were aware of this before visiting and a taxi to/from Tavira was only €8, while many guests had bicycles to tour the local villages but a car may be suitable if you intend to visit the town frequently or travel the wider area . One warning - due to the lovely wetlands around this coastal area, at night-time there are mosquitos outside in large numbers and we were bitten many times before buying anti-mosquito spray to repel them and treatment for bites, so suggest you come prepared .. or restrict your time outside after dark",Jun,2025,Jun 2025,2025-06-01,2025,4

Algarve Surf Hostel - Lagos,nanamilord,1,nanamilordwrote a review Apr 2015,"I've been to Algarve Surf Hostel twice now, and I'm going back this summer. Do I really need to say more? This hostel is the best. Staff is nice, rooms are nice and clean, everything about this hostel is awesome. They make you breakfast in the morning, and even pastry sometimes, they have a pool and a grill. Seriously what else do you need? If you're looking to surf, make new friends, and have the time of your life, go there. And even if you're not interested in surfing, you can still go there. It is everything you've ever expected and even more. Lagos is a lovely city, and this hostel is well located. You can walk to everywhere between 15-20 mins (restaurants, bars, the closest beach, grocery store, etc.), but if you're not walker (or you're a little drunk and it's 5 AM in the morning), cabs are very cheap. I recommend this hostel to everyone. Great time and great memories. Thank you Algarve Surf Hostel !",Apr,2015,Apr 2015,2015-04-01,2015,5

I will say upon arrival there was no teeth and eyes from the front desk clerk. I gave him my name and he looked at the computer and asked why I had 4 reservations (which was incorrect). No welcome or anything (and I am a lifetime Titanium member). The next stop was the concierge to ask a question. He was wearing a gold key so I expected decent attitude. I asked my question and he was so dismissive I avoided him the rest of the stay. The room was lovely although chairs on the balcony would have been nice. My room overlooked a hospital and the airport. We never got the room cool either. We had lounge access. This lounge should be used as a standard for other lounges. The food was always replenished. The staff (Phillippa and the other evening girl) especially were fantastic. Every evening was a different selection of hot and cold food. So nice after the Milan Marriott where every evening was the same awful food. This lounge is large with outdoor seating overlooking the pool. Truly a highlight. What I thought was great was when a woman came into the lounge with 5 guests. The girls told her very nicely that she was allowed 1 guest. I like that they stuck to the rules. They were there for a convention and probably she took an lounge access room and figured she would bring them all in for the free food and drink.  It was good to see them adhering to the rules.So would I stay again?  I am not so sure.",Nov,2019,Nov 2019,2019-11-01,2019,4

Vila Galé Albacora,John W,6,John Wwrote a review Aug 2015,"Location settings were very peaceful with the estuary river running 50 m  parallel to the rear of the hotel.Once tide was out the beach was exposed. Nice place to walk along. Rest a while or fishing. The  locals use the area for a day out. Most times the Hotel car park was full, I would guess this is part of the reason. I came from Faroe Airport and took a taxi travelling solo. The Taxi fare I thought expensive, 54 euros. You would be far better pre booking on line for a better deal,That was one way.I did not want the hassle. I paid the price.The hotel is located in a Bird Sanctuary most of which looks like Marsh land.You can buy a 3 euro ticket at the reception for a ferry which will take you around the peninsula to sandy beaches.Choice of two ferrys.There is a shuttle bus running from the hotel and will drop off and pick up at the Hotel .It will take you into Tavira and bring you back at scheduled times. If you have the same driver as I had he will look and act as if you do not exist and could not care anyway !Not the caring type perhaps.I used this transport a few times. If you wish to come back before the bus pick pick up, the taxi fares from Tavira were very good. About 5euro. I did not rate the breakfasts or the dinners, It was never hot enough.The choice was varied as you would expect. A lot of seafood, It looked good. In effect it all tasted similar.I was fully inclusive but I eat out most days.The snack bar was very  good. Anything from toasted sandwich to coffee or alcohol soft drinks and ice cream. To eat at a table or take to the pool area which is close by. The problem of finding a sun lounger was easy. Never a problem. Plenty for all. That is a first for me.The staff were multi tasking and in some cases it showed. The entertainment crew around the pool area seemed very amateurish. But relied on the atmosphere  to get  through there act.The room I had was pretty basic and although it had two chairs and a table just outside the rear door. No privacy, as you looked directly through a very thin hedge in front and a strip of soil with some weedy looking plant  from next door On the other side I had a air conditioning unit plodding merrily away.The cleaners were friendly and helpful . I maintained myself basically. The hygiene was standard. I love my coffee and found that you can borrow one from reception on request with no charge. Made my day !. I would not return to this hotel again. I have given it a 3 rating but it should have 3.5 to be fair.I have tried to be fair throughout .We are all different and have varying tastes.

The sauna, steam room and indoor pool were closed and the spa was offering a reduced service. There were no fire or emergency exit instructions in the room. Fie hoses were being installed and some fire doors are missing. Aircon didn't work in our room and the room phone didn't work. Food in the restaurant wasn't hot enough and quality was mediocre. We complained about the room and we were eventually moved to a better room with aircon that worked and a phone that had a dialing tone but no directory, so we still couldn't use it. There's no entertainment provided. There are umbrellas around the pool but nowhere else in the grounds, so you're limited to where you can sit, unless you're a hardened sun-worshiper. The staff are very friendly and helpful, but they lack  leadership and management direction. This hotel does not justify a five star rating, it's a three at best.",Jul,2017,Jul 2017,2017-07-01,2017,3

A great restaurant called Fabulas is just a few minutes walk away and I ate there for three of the nights I stayed although there are many food options available.If I ever return to Lisbon I would definitely stay here again.,Aug,2017,Aug 2017,2017-08-01,2017,5
Cloud 9 Hostel,rfitz537,59,rfitz537wrote a review Mar 2017,"This was one of my favourite hostels I've stayed in during my travels. The location is very convenient, just a few minutes to walk to the beach, or approximately 10 minute walk from the train station. The staff were really friendly, and I had a great time going out with the other guests for their pub crawls. I was also around for a booze cruise or two! I stayed in a four person dorm, which had its own private bathroom. This hostel also has a rooftop patio which is a great place to chill out.

Royal Savoy Hotel,Lucy M,3,Lucy Mwrote a review Feb 2016,"Visited the Royal Savoy twice now in the last 6 months. Our first visit last August was excellent. We wanted somewhere warm for a quick February half term break so decided Madeira again as it's so close and easy to travel to from the UK. Wherever you go in Madeira, people are so friendly and polite. We were lucky enough to have a 5th floor balcony for first visit, for beautiful views of the sea and then a ground floor room this time round, although we didn't have the views, it was really convenient with my 8 year old, to access the pool area without getting dressed to walk through hotel. Food is excellent, amazing breakfast every morning, eggs cooked to order and the fruit tastes so much nicer in Maderia. Choose this hotel for a relaxing stay with good food, friendly company, quiet, clean and well maintained pool areas. It really is paradise.  Will be going back again soon!",Feb,2016,Feb 2016,2016-02-01,2016,5

The pool is very nice and clean - even in November was good enough time to be able to enjoy.It was a very pleasant weekend, where I used to rest and recover sleep in a bed that looked like a cloud, and despite sleeping late the owners were always very happy with breakfast.The visit to the Chocolate Factory is something unique, that even after so long I again gave for myself immersed as if it was the first visit.Anxious to return to this second \"home\"",Nov,2024,Nov 2024,2024-11-01,2024,5
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Theresa D,4,Theresa Dwrote a review Mar 2024,"Me and 2 friends stayed here the end of March for 1 week in a sea view self catering apartment. The apartment was amazingly equipped for self catering, our only complaint is that the oven had a microwave feature which was pretty useless, but we worked around that.Room was cleaned daily and bins emptied. The shower was absolutely amazing and was something we all commented on. I can't really fault the self catering at all and we had such an amazing view from our balcony over the pool and the beach.2 minutes walk to the beautiful beach , a lovely pool with plenty of sun loungers. A sauna which runs from 12-6pm, right next to the pool. There is also a beautiful hiking trail on the beach up some beautiful rock formations which extends around the coastline and takes roughly an hour there and back and is breathtaking!We didn't attend any restaurants within the hotel so I can't comment on the quality, but we did get lunch in the lobby one day and it was very reasonably priced, about â‚¬8 for a substantial burger and chips and was very delicious.Staff were all so lovely and overall the whole complex was spotlessly clean!From other reviews it seems issues were had with the all inclusive packages, I'd recommend self catering to anyone coming here as we enjoyed cooking ourselves some meals and walking 5 minutes to the local strip which had PLENTY of food options at very good prices.Overall I'd for sure come back here and intend to do so with my partner and will definitely go self catering again.",Mar,2024,Mar 2024,2024-03-01,2024,4

Playground.Reasonably priced pool/cafe bar, cocktails €4.50, large beer €2.50.Mini market we didn't use as there is a large Intermarche supermarket a 10 -15 min walk up the road out of the resort.Main onsite restaurant we didn't use.Free minibus 3 times a day there and back to nearest resort town Armacao.Area around the complex is very scenic and quiet ,it's all about the beaches of which there are several within walking distance,all uncrowded, deserted at times. There are steps leading directly down to two fantastic large beaches one accessed via a tunnel cut through the cliff, or you can walk along the clifftop to a small cove beach to the right of the complex. If you walk in the other direction directly behind the Terrace club hotel you come to the Alporchinos area,there are a couple of restaurants,a patisserie and steps down to another fantastic large beach which you could easily miss. Not a lot to do at night, I think most would find it too quiet especially in October,  though travelling with a 4 year old that didn't bother us.",Nov,2013,Nov 2013,2013-11-01,2013,4

This turned out to be a godsend, since the marina is an altogether calmer and less stifling oasis compared to central. The Altis is all about the staff, really friendly, helpful and always a smile. From reception to restaurant to housekeeping, they are all so warm and happy to help. The marina area is quiet by night and the Altis has two fantastic restaurants a 2 min walk opposite.. Nikkei and Vela Latina.With a relaxing spa area downstairs and a rooftop pool and sun lounging area upstairs, it's a welcome addition after a day in the city.

Vila GalÃ© Tavira,legend14,285,legend14wrote a review Jul 2009,We travelled to the Vila Gale Tavira hotel in November 2008 for a weeks holiday.Unlike some of the earlier reviews we found the hotel to be very comfortable and at this time of the year not too busy. Tavira is a working town and not overly busy with tourists. This suited us very much as we were looking forward to a relaxing week. The hotel is only about a 10 minute walk from the centre of town which is a very attractive centre from which to explore the area. There are good links by either bus or train from Tavira to Faro and other parts of the Algarve. Our room was pleasanty furnished and overlooked the swimming pool and had a balcony. The weather was quite warm throughout the week and very pleasant for this time of the year. We did not experience any of the noise late at night which some earlier reviewers had mentioned. The restaurant had a reasonable selection available which was of a good standard.There are plenty of places of interest to visit in the town one of which is the Tuna museum. A complementary bus service runs directly from the hotel to the museum.We enjoyed our holiday so much we have already booked this hotel again for this coming November.If you are looking for a quiet relaxing holiday then this could be for you.,Jul,2009,Jul 2009,2009-07-01,2009,4

We had a separate bedroom which was bliss.Evening entertainment again was limited but nice - the main entertainer Mauro is the nicest guy and a fantastic singer.Tips - there is a intermarche nearby - check on google - itâ€™s a bit cheaper than local supermarkets and just as close.-Take a boat ride to Benimin? caves - we took the 6.5 hr with beach barbecue which was excellent.-There is a laundry on site â‚¬4 for wash and â‚¬4 for dryer which helped our stock of clean clothes for the week.",Oct,2021,Oct 2021,2021-10-01,2021,4

Hotel The Cliff Bay,BettieS,0,BettieSwrote a review Jul 2025,"The hotel was very clean and comfortable. We had booked a family room (2 adults+teens) with views of the bay and Funchal. The rooms are spacious and the beds super comfortable. The only criticism here, there were for us a bit few cabinets for the clothes of four people.As meals we had booked half board. In the morning there is a rich buffet and in the evening a 3-course menu which changes daily. There is also an extra children's menu (up to 12 years) and a menu for vegetarians, but these are not changed.The location of the hotel is good, it is about 30 minutes walk and you are in the city center of Funchal. Outside the door is a bus stop for the regular buses and the bus to the airport. There is free parking. Car hire providers are nearby (but you can also get help from the hotel here)We really liked the hotel. All the many people- at the reception, in the restaurants, in front of and behind the scenes do a great job, are always friendly and helpful to give guests a relaxing and nice holiday.

Casa Vela Boutique House,diana2278,26,diana2278wrote a review Sep 2016,"From the moment we arrived at the guest house I knew we were in for a great stay. The house itself is beautifully decorated and has a real homely feel but it is the garden area that is truly beautiful- very secluded and quiet the perfect place to relax in the sun. We received a very warm welcome from the lovely owner who took the time to show us around and tell us some history about the building.We arrived early but our room was ready after only a 5 minute wait. The room we were in was Azores one of the standard rooms in the older part of the hotel, it had a lovely balcony with direct access to the gardens. The room itself was clean and brightly decorated with every thing we needed for our stay. One thing I would say is if you are a light sleeper or like to sleep in you would be better asking for a different room as it is directly above the breakfast room and was quite loud from around 7.30am onwards as other guests started breakfast. (The Timor room next to ours would also have the same issue)Breakfast was plentiful, continental style but enough to suit all tastes and the honesty bar and free Nespresso coffee was a nice touch.The location is a short 10 min (maximum) walk to the centre of Cascais. Some other reviews have mentioned that the uphill walk back from town is a little tough however we had no issue with this and wouldn't describe it as a difficult walk.The hotel also offer a driver service to the airport which we used and for €45 was much more convenient than getting the train.Overall a great place for a relaxing break, would highly recommend.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

If you are lucky enough like we and the hotel is half occupied you can enjoy magnificent sun rises and sun sets in infinity pool with no one around you.Breakfast is cook to order so don’t expect buffet but variety of different cold cuts and sweet bites.Some minor negative remarks as a room for future improvement:- no daily supply of toiletries to the apartment- staff should remove cushions from a pool area for a night so that these stay dry for a morning swim or breakfastAll in all, this place is magnificent and when you are looking for a spot for a romantic getaway in Azores White is not to be missed!",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,4

You get kicked out of rooms at 10am on check out days and check in days you canâ€™t get in till 5 unless you are lucky and your room is ready at 2pm.The a le Carte restaurants on site are tiny and only take 3 bookings per half hour and they are constantly booked up even though you get told to come back each day at 4pm for the following days availabilities yet my husband went dead on 4pm and somehow it was fully booked, we decided to go to the tapas restaurant and check with them directly to which we were told they did have space!Rooms - these are ok but need updating.Rating - I would not class this as a 4* hotel at all itâ€™s more like a 2+/3 star.Expect lot of teenagers there for partying, we were woke most night/mornings around 4/5am with them coming in from The Strip.",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,2

The hotel is not very clean and the entire place is run down and needs to be completely refurbished. When closing our balcony door the wall collapsed and the rest of the building is not much better. The pool tiles were all broken and although in the most beautiful setting not worth the money. I have stayed in better one star hotels. Also very high up and if you dont want to drive after a drink then the walk back up to the hotel is very dangerous and not well lit.
