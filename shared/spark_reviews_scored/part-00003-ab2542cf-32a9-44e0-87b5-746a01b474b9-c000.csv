Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,555Mary555,0,555Mary555wrote a review Sep 2019,"Sadly seem to have been one of the few who encountered the unhelpful reception staff, asked for hairdryer, iron, help to retrieve clothing fallen off balcony etc during stay to no avail.Not.much to do as young people in there 20s. Facilities looked good for young families and older couples. We sadly were somewhat.bored.Free transfers to beach/town- times very limited.Good location to strip but rooms at front of hotel get the noise from the bars etc across the road.Very clean.Excellent breakfast array and choixe with very helpful staff at breakfast.Good range of gym facilities.Extractor fans in bathrooms badly needed and much improved hairdryers.Very honest staff, we accidentally left money out on bed and returned to find room cleaned and money in place!!",Sep,2019,Sep 2019,2019-09-01,2019,2
Belmar Spa & Beach Resort,Shelby627,0,Shelby627wrote a review Jul 2024,"I thought the apartment was a great size, however, the beds were very uncomfortable. The location was great, and was only a 6 minute drive into the town of Lagos. The included breakfast is nothing special, but it was nice to have that as an option in the morning. I do recommend the hotel as it was very beautiful",Jul,2024,Jul 2024,2024-07-01,2024,3
Saccharum,Jacqueline R,6,Jacqueline Rwrote a review Apr 2016,"First class hotel,staff very well drilled! As there isn't much to do in Calheta I would recommend taking the hotel bus into Funchal on a couple of occasions. The rum factory is well worth a visit and you should definitely try the dolphin and whale watching trip.",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,4
Tivoli Carvoeiro Algarve Resort,DayTrip373829,0,DayTrip373829wrote a review Nov 2024,"A great view, fantastic breakfasts and comfy beds. The downsides were that the outdoor pool was being repaired and nobody had forewarned us of this, and you can’t get down to the beach from the hotel. The salad nicoise from the Azur Bar, which we had to eat in whilst waiting for our room to be ready ( despite arriving at midday out of season), was the most uninspiring minimalist offering at quite an expense. This didn’t set the tone for a great introduction. The rooms have hard flooring which meant we were kept awake all night by other guests in a room indirectly above who sounded like they were dropping things on the floor and scraping chairs ALL NIGHT. I also would prefer to have a bath as well as a shower in a 5* hotel. The decor was plain white and uninspiring. This was a nice hotel but I have stayed in better. Our room was also missing a load of crockery items one day which we had to ring and request from the front desk.",Nov,2024,Nov 2024,2024-11-01,2024,4
Hotel Madeira,helen g,19,helen gwrote a review Jun 2016,"We stayed for two weeks here, returning 6th June.our room was small, and limited storage space, but I asked for extra coat hangers which helped to resolve that.We had a small balcony overlooking the street, it was a bit noisy over the weekend (music in the local gardens) but no real problem.Breakfast plentiful and all good, roof top bar/ bistro was good (lovely views) but not too much shade.The location is excellent, one block from municipal gardens, a shopping mall and .(supermarket in basement). Local to restaurants.Two blocks from the sea front, and a little further from the cathedral.",Jun,2016,Jun 2016,2016-06-01,2016,4
Villas Barrocal,Andres R,40,Andres Rwrote a review Jul 2025,"The village is located in a small village near the sea a 10min drive. It is a complex of villas, some ground floor others 1st floor. The village as a whole is nice but there are also things to improve.Pros: The rooms are spacious and comfortable, all have air conditioning. On arrival in the village the room was very clean, the kitchen well equipped with everything you need;Beds and pillows are top, rest guaranteed.The common areas such as the pool and bar are well maintained, the bar also offers breakfast lunch and dinner although the menu is limited is still a good option if one day you get bored cooking. The pool is cleaned daily and there is always enough space for umbrellas as it is not a resort full of people.The gardens are well maintained with beautiful palm trees and there is also barbecue which can be used by all for meat and fish.The parking is very convenient within the village and is often located near your room. Overall the residence is clean and maintenance is not lacking although there are things to improve.The dishwasher had problems going but then it was solved because the technician arrived promptly to explain the operation. The blonde girl at reception was very professional and attentive in resolving the situation.Cons: on arrival on July 21 at about 6pm we are told to park outside and after check in to be able to enter with the car. In my opinion it is a useless thing because if I booked I do not know what changes to open the gate and let me in instead of letting me park outside waiting. Often returning from the sea there were queues because people carelessly left their car at the gate waiting for check-in not caring about people queuing to get in. We are explained few things at check-in, the guy was quick enough explaining only how the gate works and where our room was located, missing in important things so we then had to call to inquire. Bad reception.Although the room was very clean on our arrival, the other 3-4 times they went to clean it they did it very mediocrely, with sand on the floor of the balcony and the rooms and without ever giving us refill bath foam (10 days with 4 bottles 10ml bath foam and shampoo and 1 small bar of soap) and once they did not even change towels. We were in 3 adults and 2 children so 5 and always systematically left us only 4 towels.Washing machine not present in the room and Laundry Service is charged € 4.50 but are open from 9am to 5pm. There are only 2 washing machines that are the same that the ladies use for cleaning rooms. So in addition to losing a morning-afternoon to the washing machine, you hope they're not there to wash. In my opinion the place should be kept open 24h because people go to the sea during the day and go out and in the evening calmly washes clothes, even more so if you have decided not to put washing machines in the room.Game room practically non-existent as perpetually with lights off and with a table tennis table and billiards without balls (should be asked at reception I assume, perhaps for a fee) and the game room is invaded by mattresses leaning against the wall and other junk of the village.Booking from the site, the safe was included in the room's things, with no mention that it was for a fee. Once there, the safe cost €3.50 per day. They might even avoid charging for the safe.If they improved these things it would be really impeccable.",Jul,2025,Jul 2025,2025-07-01,2025,4
Jupiter Albufeira Hotel - Family & Fun,gemmalouise2015,7,gemmalouise2015wrote a review Sep 2023,"This hotel is absolutely brilliant. I don't know where to begin...The entertainment team are great and have so much energy. Fridays pool party is a lot of fun for both adults and children. They work hard to engage the children and the children idolise them. We stayed with our children in kids club because they were under 4 years but it's still a nice space to be inside and play for a while.The pools are lovely, the splash park and slides were a hit with the children and the swim up bar is greatFood is excellent. The buffet is repetitive but the food is great quality, tasty and well kept up to so it really doesn't matter. You can vary what you have each evening and can use the al carte twice a week during your stay. There is a large cocktail list and the beer and wine are good. The children enjoyed pancakes and Nutella for breakfast and the desserts were exceptional. Breakfast was brilliant and one evening there was pork charcutterite which was my personal highlight.Honestly our holiday last year nearly put us off all inclusive a forever but this hotel is superb and we cannot fault it.Some tips- bring insect repellant for the wasps and mosquitos-try out the roof top bar (floor 10)-go on the shuttle bus to Alfuferia old town-walk in to the new town, down the 'strip' to the beach",Sep,2023,Sep 2023,2023-09-01,2023,5
Vila Gale Nep Kids,Elisa Valente,0,Elisa Valentewrote a review May 2025,"The Vila Galé NepKids seems to be a true paradise for families with children, in which to offer a complete and memorable experience. From the first moment, the availability and sympathy of Raquel in expediting possible changes in the accommodation, demonstrating the care of the hotel in providing an attentive and personalized service, even before you have arrived.On arrival, the contagious energy of Aunt Pipoca, super fun and motivating, creates a welcoming atmosphere for the small guests. The organization of children's activities is well thought out, offering varied options and tailored to children's interests, with appropriate times.The food offered in the hotel is sufficient and of good quality, and the balance of waste management is visible. Always present the care with feeding for the smallest, with various options, counting on healthy options. The prices seem fair given the excellence of the service, and it is praiseworthy to include traditional Portuguese dishes—like the delicious pork cheeks, which were clearly a success, in my opinion!The accommodation is a high point of the experience, surpassing the expectations of the children with the amazing basement that includes a slide. The space of the rooms and sanitary facilities is adequate and kept with impeccable cleanliness.As for the children’s attractions, the hotel offers a wide variety of options that ensure the fun of the little ones—from the climbing at the entrance to the game machines, swimming pool with water activities, trampolines, karts, lake seagulls, carousel and even transport to explore and pedagogical workshops.Finally, there was space and interest on the part of the management, Melanie, in listening to guest opinions/suggestions.Thank you to all the staff, who crossed with us, showed professionalism and dedication, contributing to making our entire experience even more positive.",May,2025,May 2025,2025-05-01,2025,4
Dona Filipa Hotel Vale Do Lobo,dog07,10,dog07wrote a review Aug 2016,"This is following my review in July 2014 - Have stayed at the hotel many times over the last 10 years and part of the reason for returning is seeing the same familiar friendly faces.  - especially in the bar.  But no more, the hotel is under a new manager  and when we arrived last week we found two members of staff, with over 60 years service between them, gone. They seem to have been replaced with trainees, one of which only managed to grunt at us.The hotel does not feel the same, maybe the staff are worried about who is next!. If it was your first visit to the hotel you may not notice but having built a relationship with the staff, like so many other regular customers, it is obvious.There were other small (I assume cost cutting changes) that we noticed, no welcome back letter from the house manager, no bottle of wine and chocolate strawberries on the last day - only a gesture I suppose, for having visited the hotel over 30 times in the last 10 years, but meant a lot.It is a real shame as the hotel is not 5 star but we have always looked past the dated decor, and kept returning for the familiar staff and location, unfortunately it seems that soon it may be just for the location - time to try somewhere else?Please Dona Filipa let me know what is going on .......",Aug,2016,Aug 2016,2016-08-01,2016,3
Hotel Madeira,nikiroo29,53,nikiroo29wrote a review Oct 2017,"I was so disappointed with our stay. The hotel is beautiful, it is perfectly located, but the pictures of the rooms online are very deceiving. The rooms are super, super basic. I mean a bed and a shower and that’s about it. No iron, no fridge, we had a terrible view, and the fuse box in our room kept buzzing and rattling all night. Super uncomfortable beds. The location is superb though, and the pool area was nice. If you have a car, I would recommended staying elsewhere. The glasses in our room were also very dirty.",Oct,2017,Oct 2017,2017-10-01,2017,2

Pestana Vila Lido,Julia B,1,Julia Bwrote a review Sep 2025,"We had an amazing and relaxing stay at this hotel in Madeira and couldn’t be more pleased with the experience. The amenities were top-notch, and the service was truly impeccable—staff were attentive, friendly, and always willing to help. A special mention to Lizbeth at the breakfast buffet, who greeted everyone by name each morning and even remembered birthdays to offer a warm “Happy Birthday.” The food selection at breakfast was excellent, with plenty of variety to start the day. The front desk staff were also very helpful, and the manager went above and beyond to assist us in resolving an issue with a tour company.Our room was spotless throughout our stay, thanks to the excellent housekeeping team, and the balcony offered spectacular views that made every morning and evening feel special. The pool area was especially comfortable and clean, with plenty of loungers and umbrellas, making it easy to relax at any time of day. Being able to swim directly in the ocean by going down the stairs was another highlight that made the stay unforgettable.Overall, everything about our time here was wonderful, and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Madeira.",Sep,2025,Sep 2025,2025-09-01,2025,5

Casa das Merceeiras,Hada_del_Bosque,38,Hada_del_Bosquewrote a review Apr 2016,"Casa das Merceeiras is a gem. Located in the Alfama, the oldest and in my opinion most charming district of Lisbon, it is a lovely place to stay if you are looking for a quiet, yet central spot. The famous Tram 28 stops right around the corner, Sé Cathedral is 200 m away, the Fado bars of the district are within walking distance. As Casa das Merceeiras is located in a small side street, it is very quiet, and you feel miles away from the bustling of the city centre. The whole atmosphere of the place really set a calm and gentle pace for our holiday. Teresa, the host, is very friendly and does everything she can to make sure you enjoy your stay, without being pushy. She has a great eye for detail, which resonates both in her dealings with guests and in the very tasteful renovation and furnishing of Casa das Merceeiras. We enjoyed our stay, and would recommend this place to every traveler looking for fine accommodation.",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,5
Estalagem Da Ponta Do Sol,seancrome,9,seancromewrote a review Jan 2016,"We spent a wonderful week at this truly amazing hotel. It has Beautiful minimalist architecture and interior design. The hotel is located on its own at the top of a cliff over looking the sea and the village of Ponta do Sol, 20 minutes west of Funchal. It is not typical of any holiday resort hotel and as such has a quietly layed back but sophisticated feel. The staff are friendly and helpful but not intrusive. The hotel is exceptionally well maintained and has splendid and well kept gardens. The facilities are excellent. You have a heated outdoor infinity pool with nicely arranged sun loungers. There is a really warm indoor pool, a jacuzzi that is set outside on its own area, great sauna and steam room. The Hotel also offers reasonably priced massage therapies. Breakfast was a spectacular event that runs from 07.30 till 11.00. It is aimed primarily at a continental menu however there is a different hot option available every day which I thought was actually quite unusual but excellent. Great coffee and various milk options available for dairy free! We stayed for the first week in January and the hotel was full. It never felt crowded and you could always get to use the facilities. A haven of tranquility and beauty! Looking forward to our next visit! Enjoy!",Jan,2016,Jan 2016,2016-01-01,2016,5

It´s located in tipical Alentejano house The room was clean, had a private bathroom and felt really private. Even on breakfast (excellent by the way, served in the garden) when the patio got prety full it was really comfortable, we could have quiet breakfast without hearing other peopel conversations.

Lisbon Marriott Hotel,snworb,248,snworbwrote a review Jun 2019,"I am a Platinum member and a huge fan of the Marriott group. This hotel was a total disappointment and part of the blame has to be based upon the clientele and some of the staff. I arrived and went to the Executive Lounge for a bottle of water at 3.30pm and discovered every table had dirty dishes and not one staff member. In the evening the situation got worse. One lounge patron had his feet on a table and a couple of ladies had their feet on chairs across from them. I would not expect that kind of behaviour. When the appetizers came out the guests were like vultures that had not eaten for days. In addition, one lady grabbed six bottles of water and 4 cans of sodas and left but returned 10 minutes later with 2 large coffee mugs that she filled with wine to the brim. Totally rude. The breakfast was more civilized. The hotel is convenient to the airport which is a positive. The Sheraton in Lisbon is far superior than this Marriott",Jun,2019,Jun 2019,2019-06-01,2019,1

PortoBay Liberdade,303happy1,19,303happy1wrote a review Oct 2016,Stayed for four nights.  On our arrival we had been upgraded to a superior room.  We had requested a room at the back due to the building work at the front of the Hotel.  We were very pleased how our request had been dealt with.  We arrived at our room & opened the door only to find a lady in the room half undressed.  It transpired the receptionist had transposed the room number on our key. Our actual room was several doors away.  It was quite embarrassing for the lady in question.  The Concierge who was bringing our cases up soon sorted the matter out. The staff in the Hotel are lovely & friendly. We had a nice meal in the Hotel on our first night which was very good and the staff were excellent.  The only real gripe is that you have to pay for tea/coffee unless you are in a Suite.  There were 4 free pods for coffee but then you had to pay for them & they were expensive.  I have never stayed in a 5* hotel where tea & coffee had to be paid for. Very disappointing.  Dirty cups were not removed even though we contacted reception. Overall had a nice stay but feel the rating should be more 4*,Oct,2016,Oct 2016,2016-10-01,2016,2
Casa Pinto,Townie-TRIP,81,Townie-TRIPwrote a review Mar 2016,"Monsaraz is as picturesque as it gets and Casa Pinto is as fantastic as possible. On a small street of white washed houses is this phenomenal gem of a place. Once inside you could be in Morocco. The attention to detail is outstanding. There's a wonderful roof top terrace complete with a bar and wonderful places to lounge and watch the sunset. The space is small but so well thought out. The hosts are terrific and make you feel right at home. For me, this was the perfect place to stay in this enchanting area of Portugal.",Mar,2016,Mar 2016,2016-03-01,2016,5
Lisbon Marriott Hotel,burnsomaha,117,burnsomahawrote a review Feb 2014,"We stayed at this hotel only because United chose it for us.  Our flight was cancelled because of mechanical issues and they put us up for the night at this hotel.  It was a VERY pleasant encounter.  I have to give this hotel a lot of credit.  At a moment's notice, they had around 250 passengers to deal with - ensuring enough rooms were available, having dinner ready for the evening and breakfast the next morning.  They did an outstanding job of increasing staff to handle the load.Check-in was amazingly fast even though all of the passengers came at once to the lobby.  I had 3 people in my party, so we got 2 rooms.  One was a twin and one was a Queen room.  The beds were very nice, pillow-top mattress, variety of pillows and exceptional linens (we had just stayed at the Lisbon DoubleTree the night before where the beds are awful).  We had small balconies but the weather was terrible, so we did not use them.  However, we could see part of the Lisbon Aquaduct from our room when it wasn't raining so hard.We went down for the dinner buffet they prepared.  Again, for the short notice, it was wonderful.  A variety of main courses, salad bar, desserts, everything.  They even served us wine with our meal - thanks United! :-)We, then, went to the bar for a nightcap.  We had a vodka/7-up, redbull and a beer - 20EUR.  We only had one round.  The bartender was very nice, however.  He had a lot to take care of since he was inundated with crabby passengers.We went back to the room, watched a movie, and went to bed.  We got up the next morning (well, I got up the next morning while the teenagers slept in) to have breakfast.  I got there a little late for their breakfast buffet, so there wasn't a lot left.  But, I just wanted a cup of coffee anyway, so it was fine.  They had the typical European fare for breakfast and tried to do some American-style food as well.  Their scrambled eggs, however, turned out to be scrambled egg soup (they should have fried them a little longer).  All-in-all, though, it was fine.If I ever return to Lisbon, I would definitely consider this hotel. Quality people, quality hotel rooms, good location.  Of course, I don't know how much it cost United for my rooms, so I can't tell you if it was a good value (it was for me, of course, this time :-) )",Feb,2014,Feb 2014,2014-02-01,2014,4
Vila Galé Albacora,Fatima P,6,Fatima Pwrote a review Sep 2016,"Eco-Hotel Vila Galé Albacora has a special appeal to people who enjoy nature. It stands on a natural park which by it self is a pro. On top of that the hotel itself is based on an old tunafishing small vilage. You can imagine how this place was back in the days (visit their museum, it's worth it). The location is superb, you're not in the town per se (and that is definatelly a plus), but close enough to enjoy what Tavira has to offer.We've read that the mosquitos are well present. Well it's true and that can be a nuisance, but let's face it, the salt pans are just a step away, and if you want to benefit from all that a natural park has to offer (from birdwatching, to proximity of the island and the silence of being in the outskirts) you have to accept that the pros outnumber the cons easily.The staff is always ready to help with a smile of their face and the manager is 5 stars.The food... well let's just say that it won't be easy to find the same quality (freshness, flavour, diversity) in town for the same value, not in your dreams.Also people complain about the lack of light between the hotel and Tavira... it's a natural park and Hote Albacora it's a Eco-hotel and although they have nothing to do with the path that separates the hotel from the town of Tavira (that might have to be something related to the town hall) one has to realize that local fauna must be protected. I'm sure that there are a bunch of rules that have to be taken in order for the hotel to maintain that \"Eco\" prefix.All and all is a unique experience that people should consider, wether with their families, with their loved ones and even by themselves.",Sep,2016,Sep 2016,2016-09-01,2016,4

He also arranged for a bottle of champagne and flowers to be delivered to our room. Such a nice touch.The rooms were full of classic charm, very comfortable beds, high quality linen and a mini bar with a range of complimentary soft drinks that was replenished every day.The afternoon tea on the terrace was a real treat, but we heard it was (understandably) very popular so we booked a month or two before arriving.The staff are just incredible, and so hard working. Nothing is too much trouble. We thank them all enormously for making our stay so special.Everything about this hotel screams luxury, and it is definitely somewhere we want to spend a lot of time in the future. It is, quite simply, our new favourite hotel in the world.",Mar,2022,Mar 2022,2022-03-01,2022,5

Many nice private spots for outdoor lounging. Extra cost to use Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna as part of the spa. Was disappointed with a massage. The provider left in the middle, returned a few minutes later - disjointed experience.

Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,Excursion553948,11,Excursion553948wrote a review May 2018,Appaling customer service when this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.I booked the Crowne Plaza Vilamoura through hotelquickly at noon on the 22nd of May.I arrived the Crowne Plaza Vilamoura at 13.00 on the 22nd of May. The lady at the front desk of the Crowne Plaza Vilamoura could not find my booking. She said that (a) I could not check in until the hotel could find my booking on the system; and (b) the only lady who could find my booking on the system was the reservations manager who would not arrive until 14.00.I sat down in the lobby and waited for one hour for the reservations manager. The reservations manager   introduced herself to me when she arrived and said that her name was Innes and she would look for my booking. Innes came back 5 minutes later and said that she had found my booking.To find a customer booking should be a simple process that can be carried out by any member of your reception team.You are supposed to be a 5* hotel and it is outrageous that a customer should be kept waiting for 1 hour because the only person who could find my booking was a reservations manager who was not at work when I arrived during normal office hours.I made this complaint to the general manager. He said the reservations manager found reservation when she arrived at 14.00 because hotelquickly sent the my booking confirmation to the hotel shortly before 14.00. This is a lie. I attach an email from hotelquickly which proves that they sent confirmation of my booking to the hotel at noon which is the time that I made the booking. This is outrageous customer service. There should have been no need for me to wait 1 hour for the reservations manager to arrive even if the booking turned out to be for the wrong date.I consider that you should offer a complimentary stay for this incredibly appaling customer service when this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.,May,2018,May 2018,2018-05-01,2018,1

We even had cotton under the bed. Every day we had to order towels because we never had any and it took about 3 hours to bring after we ordered 7x.The staff are not friendly, there is only one employee to serve the snack in a completely crowded hotel the only thing there is to snack are kebabs.The drinks are rationed in all aspects, we can only order two per person considering that we came in family and with children and having to always be an adult with the children this is just ridiculous. The queues are huge and the waiting time too.This hotel can only be rated as 4 stars by the beachfront location because the service is mediocre and guests are fooled by an all inclusive completely fake.",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,1

Natura Algarve Club,Aislinnrose88,17,Aislinnrose88wrote a review Apr 2016,"Just back from a week's stay in Natura Algarve with my boyfriend.  We really enjoyed our stay at these apartments.  They are located in the New Town about a half hour drive from the airport (we went via pre booked taxi with the company Yellowfish - also excellent!!)  Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely staff who were extremely helpful and accommodating.  When you arrive you must pay a â‚¬100 cash deposit, which you get back at the end of your stay provided no damage etc was caused to the room.We booked a pool view room which I would highly recommend as personally I didn't think the land view rooms had particularly nice views.  Ours was on the first floor, there are no elevators so if you have prams or difficulty with steps go for the ground floor rooms.The room we stayed in was an apartment suitable to sleep 4 people (2 single beds in the bedroom that can be pushed together if you want to make a double and then two sofa beds in the living area).  It was a lovely size with a very spacious balcony and rooms.  The kitchen was well equipped with fridge freezer, oven and 4 hobs and ample storage.  If you are planning on buying in food there is a supermarket 5 minutes walk away. The bathroom has a bath with shower attached and has plenty of hot water and good pressure. The apartment was clean with nice bright decor.  It was a little run down looking in places but this was purely aesthetic and did not have any impact on our stay whatsoever.  There is a safe in the room which you can rent for â‚¬15 per week.  It is big enough to store passports, jewellery etc and probably a tablet but would not fit a laptop.  There is air conditioning but we didn't use it as it wasn't that hot so not sure what it's like.NOTE: Make sure to read the apartment directory when you go into your apartment as there are certain things you will be charged for if not done, e.g. leaving the dishes not cleaned and put away at the end of your stay etc. so make sure to read through that booklet!We found our stay to be lovely, relaxing and quiet.  There were a couple of stag and hen groups while we were there but I believe they are quite strict on noise making so there were no real issues while we were there.The pool is a lovely size with shallow and deep end as well as a paddling pool just beyond the little bridge you'll see in the photos.  The pool gets the full sun from 10am - 5.30pm and partial sun in the earlier morning and later evening.  As April was a quieter time of year there were plenty of sun beds available so it would probably be fairly ok during the summer months.  The grounds were beautifully kept and the area the Natura Algarve is situated seems to be quite residential and leading down to a cul de sac, so pretty quiet car wise also.They have a resident cat who is very friendly and hangs out on the grounds.  Don't worry though if you don't like cats or are allergic, he wouldn't come near you unless you called him over.There is a bar by the pool which does play music from a music channel so you will have different music all the time and won't be driven mad by listening to the same 20 songs for your entire stay.  The music is quite low anyway so is not intrusive if you are trying to relax.  They also have a table tennis table, a pool table, some board games and a few shelves of books if you want to borrow one.  The sun beds were also comfortable and well maintained as was the general pool area.The apartments are about 10 minutes walk from The Strip and the beach and a half an hour walk to the Old Town.  If you are coming for lovely restaurants and bars and a bit more of a relaxed feel then I would definitely recommend taking a trip to the Old Town.  If you wanted to get a taxi there it will cost you between â‚¬6 and â‚¬8 and takes about 5 - 10 mins to drive.  The footpaths in The New Town are all done in a sort of cobblestone manner and can be quite uneven in places so if you are wearing delicate shoes with not much of a sole and want to walk all the way to the Old Town, bear that in mind, you'll feel every step!!There are some really nice places to eat near Natura Algarve too.  We went for lunch in 'Paulu's' and 'Bom Appetite' and there is also a lovely Indian place called 'Curry Leaves' - all highly rated on Trip Advisor.  If you are eating in the old town I would recommend 'Os Arcos'(excellent fresh fish and steak), 'Ricardos' (Italian with beautiful roof top terrace overlooking the sea) and 'Dom Carlos' (5 course set menu that changes daily, excellent food and service).  There are loads of great places to eat there but I would say to read TripAdvisor reviews before you go to get an idea of where's good.If you want to go clothes shopping etc then you should go to 'Algarve Shopping' - it will cost â‚¬13 in a taxi and is a very good shopping center that also has a cinema should you have bad weather and are looking for something to do.  There really isn't much shopping in the old or new town, mostly souvenir shops with the same stuff in each place.All in all we really enjoyed our trip and would definitely recommend The Natura Algarve as a good place to stay that is clean, at a good price and lovely quiet location with excellent and friendly staff:)",Apr,2016,Apr 2016,2016-04-01,2016,4
Crowne Plaza Vilamoura,jimlefevre,1,jimlefevrewrote a review Nov 2014,"We booked a room at this hotel based on the description, \"Deluxe Sea View Nonsmoking\". The non smoking was correct, but the view from the room was of the hotel entry, the parking lot and some buildings. To access the sea view, one needs to go out on the balcony, lean over and look to the left. As one who travels approximately 150 nights a year, most hotels would accurately describe this as a partial sea view. We downgraded to a superior room at 15€ per night less. The only difference was the sea view would have required one to lean out just a bit further and look to the right. The rooms are spectacular but the description is entirely misleading. Be aware in booking that the superior rooms are less expensive and have basically the same view as the rooms described as deluxe sea view.",Nov,2014,Nov 2014,2014-11-01,2014,2
Muthu Clube Praia Da Oura,Siobhan N,2,Siobhan Nwrote a review Jan 2023,"Overall experience was let down by the staff at this hotel. We arrived at 10am, we was told the room wouldnâ€™t be ready for another hour so we decided to get lunch. After returning they said to come back at 12:30, we returned to be greeted with check in at this hotel isnâ€™t until 5pm - false promises & one day of our holiday lost as we couldnâ€™t get changed anywhere. We were asked to pay â‚¬100 deposit for damages.We were told our rooms would be cleaned every other day. We kept asking the cleaners to clean our room, on the fourth day we asked the helpful reception man however the cleaners came at 6:30pm when were getting ready to out. We politely asked for clean towels and asked for the room to be cleaned the next day - the towels were launched off the upstairs balcony to us.We then asked reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned, we werenâ€™t getting anywhere with the cleaners therefore we just asked for clean towels and toilet roll. Reception do not answer their phone when you ring therefore we had to walk there every time the cleaners did not clean our room.The room struggled a lot with condensation, therefore it left the bedding, clothes etc with a damp feel.It was my partners birthday, I had to repeatedly ask for a bottle of wine to be put in the room - we ended up getting this on our last day which was inconvenient as we had an early flight the next day.I donâ€™t think the communication across reception staff and cleaners is strong.I wouldnâ€™t recommend this hotel to someone who struggles with walking as it was a 10 minute walk up hill to get to reception. Staff do not clean around the pool area therefore the tiles can become quite slippy. The cleaners also left dirty towels in bags and hoovers laying around the poo area causing trip hazards.This hotel is not a 4 star hotel.",Jan,2023,Jan 2023,2023-01-01,2023,2

Canto de Luz,Abigail D,0,Abigail Dwrote a review Aug 2024,"If youâ€™re thinking about staying here, donâ€™t hesitate, book it. It was one of the nicest hotels weâ€™ve ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived, the staff at Canto De Luz couldnâ€™t do enough for us. We were greeted with welcome drinks, recommendations of where to visit with a local map and a huge list of restaurant recommendations categorised depending on our food preference. We could contact the staff through WhatsApp to arrange trips, early breakfast and restaurant reservations.Canto De luz is a small but beautiful hotel. Our room had a huge en-site filled with lovely rituals products. We had air-con, Alexa (which was really helpful for our morning alarms), UK plug sockets and so much more. The bed was one of the comfiest weâ€™ve ever stayed in and it made it than much harder to leave. Breakfast was served fresh every morning and we really enjoyed eating in the conservatory. The new addition of the swimming pool was an added surprise bonus.The hotel itself is not far away from the centre. We donâ€™t like the noise of the centre but didnâ€™t want to be too far away and this was perfect. Within 2 minutes you have a handful of wonderful restaurants to choose from and within 20 youâ€™re down by the river.All staff were helpful and friendly. If youâ€™re looking for somewhere luxurious, small, but not too far away from the city then book it.Thank you to all, but an extra shout out to Susan who made us feel right at home.",Aug,2024,Aug 2024,2024-08-01,2024,5

Quinta das Achadas,Dakalocone,1,Dakaloconewrote a review Aug 2011,"Schools out - that can only mean one thing in our family - off to the Quinta for the now traditional summer holiday at our home from home. It is hard to explain the immediate sense of relaxation and joy that driving into Odiaxere and up the lane to the Quinta brings.We have been here more times now  than I care to remember but needless to say we have added 2 children to the original 1 we first stayed here with and every year the place gets better. Not only do we feel at home but now we meet up with friends we have made in the unique atmosphere of Jill, Julio and Isabella's home whenever we stay. This year we had met every one of the other guests on at least one previous visit. No other place could combine such diverse groups of people and ages of children and see everyone getting along and making the holiday more than just a break from routine.As habitual guests I can also say that Jill and Julio never rest on their laurels, each year they have made improvements and changes that make your stay a little different which is terrific. I'm particularly fond of how any left over pudding from the delicious meal the night before appears on the breakfast table!For anyone who has yet to experience this place it is a family friendly, well equipped central base from which to explore the Algarve.

And having Celeste, the sweetest innkeeper, find us looking lost in the village square, and personally show us to the inn was quite a sight. Despite our minimal Portuguese, we communicated quite easily as Celeste is such an experienced hostess that she anticipated virtually all our needs. The inn is on a charming street right next to restaurants, shopping, and a mini mercado (but not obnoxiously loud at night and early morning). Our room was quite comfortable, and although not large, we had enough room for our backpacks and other gear. Breakfast was simple and delicious and just seeing Celeste take such care in all her innkeeper duties made you feel well cared for. Regrettably we only stayed one night as we were on a mission to hike the Rota Vicentina and the journey continued.",Oct,2014,Oct 2014,2014-10-01,2014,4

Turim Marques Hotel,Jswitts,84,Jswittswrote a review Mar 2017,"We stayed here for three nights in february 2017 for my birthday weekend. The Hotel is located near the Marques de Pombal square, in a nice neighbourhood just outside the city centre (about a 15-20 minute walk). However, taxis are so cheap that it costs about 5 euros to get a taxi home. Here are some of the positive and negative aspects of our stay:POSITIVE:- Great first impression, the lobby area is very well decorated and it certainly has the style of a very nice hotel.- the staff were lovely and couldn't do anything more for you. i have seen some earlier reviews on here saying that they were rude. well someone has had a chat with them as this was not our experience at all. they were smiley and helpful.- the room was a good size with all the ammenities you would expect.- Breakfast was adequate, with hot and cold options, juice bar, coffee, waffles, criossants,- The check in process was swift and the staff were happy to offer to advice on where to go etc.- The bathroom was great with a powerful shower and a separate sink area.- There is a mini mart down the road if you want to get a few things for the room.NEGATIVE:- Only one lift was working, although this is due to the fact that the hotel has only been oipen since January, I am sure they will fix this soon. However, can lead to queues at some points.TIP: If you are driving, currently the hotel does not offer parking, although they said it will be finished soon. However, if you are going for the weekend, parking is free on the street just outside the hotel from after 8pm Friday until 8am on Monday morning. In the end, we paid only about 2 euros to park outside when a car park would have cost us about 30.Don't look anymore, I would definetly recommend this hotel!

Pousada Viseu,ericklei,2,erickleiwrote a review Apr 2019,"Our stay was good in the historic hotel that was a hospital before that time. The staff was very friendly and the overall service was good, nearby the centre of Viseu. The breakfast was good and rich of special Portuguese products. A little point was the bacon and the boiled eggs. No big problem however.",Apr,2019,Apr 2019,2019-04-01,2019,4

Onyria Quinta da Marinha Hotel,562ken,1,562kenwrote a review May 2022,"From arrival at the hotel after an enjoyable  taxi ride from Lisbon airport, the warm welcome from reception staff showed an approach that remained throughout my stay. A  spacious and comfortable bedroom with all the facilities one would need. The pool area is spacious and nicely laid out. The lounge, dining and bar areas all work well with the staff smiling and willing to attend to all needs.All in all, I'd completely recommend this hotel for anyone looking to relaenjoying.x and unwind in a quality environment. I didn't use the spa area but comments from others were very positive and although not a golfer, I saw enough to see that it is a quality golf course that those playing clearly were",May,2022,May 2022,2022-05-01,2022,4
"SDivine Fatima Hotel, Congress & Spirituality",Fairtrav,168,Fairtravwrote a review Jun 2021,"We had an excellent stay at this hotel a couple of weeks ago. The junior suite we stayed in was so spacious and comfortable! Everything worked well in the room. There was a minibar fridge that we could use (not stocked with minibar items at the moment as part of the ongoing hygiene measures), a kettle and sachets of tea. I would, however, advise the hotel management to apply the same hygiene principles to the drink sachets as they did with the minibar items. Remove them and only give these to the guests upon request. Our tea sachets looked crumpled and well-handled so we didn’t touch them.Depending on the number of guests, breakfast was either a buffet or a pre-ordered meal. We had the opportunity to experience both! Buffet breakfast was great with a lot of variety. There were scrambled eggs, crispy bacon slices, a variety of cheeses and ham, cereals, nuts, yoghurt, hot drinks, vegan packet drinks, different homemade jams, a variety of delicious pastries, different types of fresh bread and freshly sliced fruits (honey dew, kiwi, papaya, orange, etc.). The buffet breakfast was served by the staff. No self-service and no re-using of already used plates for hygiene reasons. Every time we wanted a second serve, the staff would serve the food on a clean plate. This was really such a good move to avoid the serving tongs/ladles coming into contact with used plates and increasing the risk of food cross-contamination!! The pre-ordered breakfast was also very good as it had the same items for guests to order (from a menu list) for breakfast the following day.Location wise, the hotel is around 7 minutes walk from the Sanctuary. The Fátima bus station is a 3-minute walk away and fast food outlets Burger King and McDonald’s are nearby. There is also a Pingo Doce supermarket in the area.The hotel is surrounded by beautiful grounds and a lush, stunning garden that is well worth exploring! There are ample free parking spaces on the grounds. The hotel also has two on-site chapels with the presence of the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. The larger chapel is absolutely stunning!! Sunday Masses (9.00 a.m.) are said here. The other chapel is smaller and very pretty and is used for daily Masses. To be able to attend daily Mass (7.20 a.m. on weekdays) was the highlight for us! Masses were beautiful and spiritually uplifting.Last but not least, the staff! They were exemplary (receptionists, breakfast staff, etc.)! Very efficient, polite, warm and friendly and taking the hygiene measures seriously. My card was wiped with a disinfectant wipe before being handed back to me! I was also given a disinfected pen with which to sign a form! Very nicely done!A beautiful hotel with beautiful chapels, beautiful grounds and beautiful people! Very peaceful and with a good ambience. It is especially good for personal self-retreats. Would stay here again without any hesitation. Highly recommended!Room tip:If staying in a junior suite with a glass divide between the room and the bathroom, bring along a pair of eyeshades because if you sleep on the side of the bed nearest this glass divide, you will be awakened by the light every time your partner goes to the bathroom! :) The blinds of the glass divide don’t block out the bathroom light adequately, unfortunately.",Jun,2021,Jun 2021,2021-06-01,2021,5
